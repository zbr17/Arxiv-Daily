- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rise of chronic diseases related to diet, such as obesity and diabetes, emphasizes the need for accurate monitoring of food intake. While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign labels to every pixel in an image based on text labels. Existing approaches typically utilize vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for dense prediction. However, VLMs, pre-trained on image-text pairs, are biased toward salient, object-centric regions and exhibit two critical limitations when adapted to segmentation: (i) Foreground Bias, which tends to ignore background regions, and (ii) Limited Spatial Localization, resulting in blurred object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner. Additionally, we propose a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) that leverages pixel-wise spatial contexts and enables channel-wise feature refinement through multi-level updates. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20072v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We address the challenge of training Vision Transformers (ViTs) when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is abundant. We propose Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE), a framework that jointly optimizes masked image reconstruction and classification using both unlabeled and labeled samples with dynamically selected pseudo-labels. SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels). Our results demonstrate that when pseudo-labels are introduced is as important as how they are generated for data-efficient transformer training. Codes are available at https://github.com/atik666/ssmae.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in vision-language representation learning, powering diverse downstream tasks and serving as the default vision backbone in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.   We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom that interpretability requires sacrificing accuracy and demonstrate that interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, offering a promising design principle for future models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20104v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained images plays an important role in automated histological image analysis, with various applications in downstream tasks. While several machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for nuclei instance segmentation, most research in this field focuses on developing new segmentation algorithms and benchmarking them on a limited number of arbitrarily selected public datasets.   In this work, rather than focusing on model development, we focused on the datasets used for this task. Based on an extensive literature review, we identified manually annotated, publicly available datasets of H&amp;E-stained images for nuclei instance segmentation and standardized them into a unified input and annotation format. Using two state-of-the-art segmentation models, one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and one based on a hybrid CNN and vision transformer architecture, we systematically evaluated and ranked these datasets based on their nuclei instance segmentation performance. Furthermore, we proposed a unified test set (NucFuse-test) for fair cross-dataset evaluation and a unified training set (NucFuse-train) for improved segmentation performance by merging images from multiple datasets.   By evaluating and ranking the datasets, performing comprehensive analyses, generating fused datasets, conducting external validation, and making our implementation publicly available, we provided a new benchmark for training, testing, and evaluating nuclei instance segmentation models on H&amp;E-stained histological images.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (e.g., ColPali) enable fine-grained Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) but incur prohibitive index vector size overheads. Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based large multimodal models, such as LLaDA-V, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in vision-language understanding and generation. However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models. Across multiple benchmarks, our best configuration reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving an average of 95% task performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20175v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Content-preserving style transfer, generating stylized outputs based on content and style references, remains a significant challenge for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) due to the inherent entanglement of content and style features in their internal representations. In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality. TeleStyle achieves state-of-the-art performance across three core evaluation metrics: style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Marine biofouling on vessel hulls poses major ecological, economic, and biosecurity risks. Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent GRPO-based approaches built on flow matching models have shown remarkable improvements in human preference alignment for text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-Trained models, notably CLIP, that utilize contrastive learning have proven highly adept at extracting generalizable visual features. To inherit the well-learned knowledge of VLP models for downstream tasks, several approaches aim to adapt them efficiently with limited supervision. However, these methods either suffer from limited performance, excessive learnable parameters, or extended training times, all of which hinder their effectiveness in adapting the CLIP model to downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient and effective method called \textit{\textbf{F}eature \textbf{P}rojection \textbf{L}earning(FPL)} to address these problems. Specifically, we develop a projection model that projects class prototype features into the query image feature space and reconstructs the query image feature map. The negative average squared reconstruction error is used as the class score. In this way, we transform the classification problem into a feature projection problem. The final output of this method is a combination of the prediction from the projection model and the original pre-trained CLIP. Comprehensive empirical evaluations confirm that FPL delivers superior accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20232v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) adapts a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to downstream tasks by inserting a small number of learnable prompt tokens into the token sequence at each layer. However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks. Beyond performance, $\mathtt{PAE}$ is prompt-agnostic and lightweight, and it integrates seamlessly with diverse VPT variants without backbone modification or inference-time changes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20246v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rise of Deep Generative Models (DGM) has enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data. When used to augment authentic data in Deep Metric Learning (DML), these synthetic samples enhance intra-class diversity and improve the performance of downstream DML tasks. We introduce BLenDeR, a diffusion sampling method designed to increase intra-class diversity for DML in a controllable way by leveraging set-theory inspired union and intersection operations on denoising residuals. The union operation encourages any attribute present across multiple prompts, while the intersection extracts the common direction through a principal component surrogate. These operations enable controlled synthesis of diverse attribute combinations within each class, addressing key limitations of existing generative approaches. Experiments on standard DML benchmarks demonstrate that BLenDeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets and backbones. Specifically, BLenDeR achieves 3.7% increase in Recall@1 on CUB-200 and a 1.8% increase on Cars-196, compared to state-of-the-art baselines under standard experimental settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to consolidate complementary information from diverse source images into a unified representation. The fused image is expected to preserve fine details and maintain high visual fidelity. While diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities in image generation, they often suffer from detail loss when applied to image fusion tasks. This issue arises from the accumulation of noise errors inherent in the Markov process, leading to inconsistency and degradation in the fused results. However, incorporating explicit supervision into end-to-end training of diffusion-based image fusion introduces challenges related to computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Reversible Efficient Diffusion (RED) model - an explicitly supervised training framework that inherits the powerful generative capability of diffusion models while avoiding the distribution estimation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies have examined attention dynamics in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect hallucinations. However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain where image data distributions may differ. Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\%, 84\%, and 97. 12\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively. Further evaluations confirm that our study improves existing methods by an average classification accuracy increment of +1.23\%, +7.26\%, and +1.77\% on the respective datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation techniques, evaluating and auditing generated videos has become increasingly crucial. Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves artifact detection accuracy and enables effective filtering of low-quality content.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20301v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as an effective technique for improving DNN robustness to input variations. However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Performance degradation due to covariate shift remains a major challenge for deep learning models in medical image segmentation. An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.   We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.   The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability. This study highlights the value of integrating anatomically similar but distribution shifted datasets to overcome data scarcity and enhance deep learning based segmentation for brachytherapy treatment planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20303v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating object mass from visual input is challenging because mass depends jointly on geometric volume and material-dependent density, neither of which is directly observable from RGB appearance. Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision. Experiments on image2mass and ABO-500 show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20308v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current methods for multivariate time series forecasting can be classified into channel-dependent and channel-independent models. Channel-dependent models learn cross-channel features but often overfit the channel ordering, which hampers adaptation when channels are added or reordered. Channel-independent models treat each channel in isolation to increase flexibility, yet this neglects inter-channel dependencies and limits performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CPiRi}, a \textbf{channel permutation invariant (CPI)} framework that infers cross-channel structure from data rather than memorizing a fixed ordering, enabling deployment in settings with structural and distributional co-drift without retraining. CPiRi couples \textbf{spatio-temporal decoupling architecture} with \textbf{permutation-invariant regularization training strategy}: a frozen pretrained temporal encoder extracts high-quality temporal features, a lightweight spatial module learns content-driven inter-channel relations, while a channel shuffling strategy enforces CPI during training. We further \textbf{ground CPiRi in theory} by analyzing permutation equivariance in multivariate time series forecasting. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art results. CPiRi remains stable when channel orders are shuffled and exhibits strong \textbf{inductive generalization} to unseen channels even when trained on \textbf{only half} of the channels, while maintaining \textbf{practical efficiency} on large-scale datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables efficient optimization and high-quality rendering, yet accurate surface reconstruction remains challenging. Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep topological data analysis (TDA) offers a principled framework for capturing structural invariants such as connectivity and cycles that persist across scales, making it a natural fit for anomaly segmentation (AS). Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift. Across standard 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks, TopoOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the most competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D AS benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal evidence is critical in computational pathology: gigapixel whole slide images capture tumor morphology, while patient-level clinical descriptors preserve complementary context for prognosis. Integrating such heterogeneous signals remains challenging because feature spaces exhibit distinct statistics and scales. We introduce MMSF, a multitask and multimodal supervised framework built on a linear-complexity MIL backbone that explicitly decomposes and fuses cross-modal information. MMSF comprises a graph feature extraction module embedding tissue topology at the patch level, a clinical data embedding module standardizing patient attributes, a feature fusion module aligning modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and a Mamba-based MIL encoder with multitask prediction heads. Experiments on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC demonstrate 2.1--6.6\% accuracy and 2.2--6.9\% AUC improvements over competitive baselines, while evaluations on five TCGA survival cohorts yield 7.1--9.8\% C-index improvements compared with unimodal methods and 5.6--7.1\% over multimodal alternatives.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20351v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Palmprint recognition is widely used in biometric systems, yet real-world performance often degrades due to feature distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous deployment conditions. Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20354v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-fidelity images, but they often fail in handling complex spatial relationships, e.g., spatial perception, reasoning, or interaction. These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20355v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scene graphs provide structured abstractions for scene understanding, yet they often overfit to spurious correlations, severely hindering out-of-distribution generalization. To address this limitation, we propose CURVE, a causality-inspired framework that integrates variational uncertainty modeling with uncertainty-guided structural regularization to suppress high-variance, environment-specific relations. Specifically, we apply prototype-conditioned debiasing to disentangle invariant interaction dynamics from environment-dependent variations, promoting a sparse and domain-stable topology. Empirically, we evaluate CURVE in zero-shot transfer and low-data sim-to-real adaptation, verifying its ability to learn domain-stable sparse topologies and provide reliable uncertainty estimates to support risk prediction under distribution shifts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20364v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, or the reverse modeling of a camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, aims to recover high-fidelity RAW data from RGB images. Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20366v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of physical security systems with environmental safety monitoring represents a critical advancement in smart infrastructure management. Traditional approaches maintain these systems as independent silos, creating operational inefficiencies, delayed emergency responses, and increased management complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive dual-modality Internet of Things framework that seamlessly integrates RFID-based access control with multi-sensor environmental safety monitoring through a unified cloud architecture. The system comprises two coordinated subsystems: Subsystem 1 implements RFID authentication with servo-actuated gate control and real-time Google Sheets logging, while Subsystem 2 provides comprehensive safety monitoring incorporating flame detection, water flow measurement, LCD status display, and personnel identification. Both subsystems utilize ESP32 microcontrollers for edge processing and wireless connectivity. Experimental evaluation over 45 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: 99.2\% RFID authentication accuracy with 0.82-second average response time, 98.5\% flame detection reliability within 5-meter range, and 99.8\% cloud data logging success rate. The system maintains operational integrity during network disruptions through intelligent local caching mechanisms and achieves total implementation cost of 5,400 BDT (approximately \$48), representing an 82\% reduction compared to commercial integrated solutions. This research establishes a practical framework for synergistic security-safety integration, demonstrating that professional-grade performance can be achieved through careful architectural design and component optimization while maintaining exceptional cost-effectiveness and accessibility for diverse application scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Crowd counting remains challenging in variable-density scenes due to scale variations, occlusions, and the high computational cost of existing models. To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20383v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-driven multi-human motion generation with complex interactions remains a challenging problem. Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20419v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research has shown that aligning fine-grained text descriptions with localized image patches can significantly improve the zero-shot performance of pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two perspectives: \emph{View Refinement} and \emph{Description refinement}, termed as \textit{\textbf{Bi}-refinement for \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{T}ext-visual \textbf{A}lignment} (BiFTA). \emph{View refinement} removes redundant image patches with high \emph{Intersection over Union} (IoU) ratios, resulting in more distinctive visual samples. \emph{Description refinement} removes redundant text descriptions with high pairwise cosine similarity, ensuring greater diversity in the remaining descriptions. BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce the Quartet of Diffusions, a structure-aware point cloud generation framework that explicitly models part composition and symmetry. Unlike prior methods that treat shape generation as a holistic process or only support part composition, our approach leverages four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and their spatial assembly. This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3D point cloud generation framework that fully integrates and enforces both symmetry and part priors throughout the generative process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20433v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deepfake detection is a widely researched topic that is crucial for combating the spread of malicious content, with existing methods mainly modeling the problem as classification or spatial localization. The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of powerful image generators, accurate detection of AI-generated images has become essential for maintaining a trustworthy online environment. However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to "contaminate" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20499v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20503v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL) are imaging features associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) that are visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The development and validation of deep learning models to segment and differentiate these features is difficult because they visually confound each other in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and often appear in the same subject. We investigated six strategies for training a combined WMH and ISL segmentation model using partially labelled data. We combined privately held fully and partially labelled datasets with publicly available partially labelled datasets to yield a total of 2052 MRI volumes, with 1341 and 1152 containing ground truth annotations for WMH and ISL respectively. We found that several methods were able to effectively leverage the partially labelled data to improve model performance, with the use of pseudolabels yielding the best result.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video generation models have achieved notable progress in static scenarios, yet their performance in motion video generation remains limited, with quality degrading under drastic dynamic changes. This is due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and increasing the difficulty of learning dynamic regions. {Unfortunately, existing diffusion models rely on static loss for all scenarios, constraining their ability to capture complex dynamics.} To address this issue, we introduce Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to guide loss weighting. LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20511v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As social media platforms proliferate, users increasingly demand intuitive ways to create diverse, high-quality portrait collections. In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification. We further propose SCheese, a framework that combines text-guided generation with hierarchical identity and detail preservation. SCheese employs adaptive feature fusion mechanism to maintain identity consistency, and ConsistencyNet to inject fine-grained features for detail consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CHEESE in advancing PCG, with SCheese achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20520v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection aims to detect and localise abnormal regions in the image without access to any in-domain training images. While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks has attracted increasing interest. Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge. This oversight limits the models' potential for effective downstream task adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation. Experimental results on 12 image classification benchmarks under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of corrective knowledge and the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20552v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR 2 to investigate the feasibility of a novel encoder-DeepEncoder V2-capable of dynamically reordering visual tokens upon image semantics. Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning. Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion-based Neural Video Compression (NVC) faces critical challenges, including severe information loss, prohibitive inference latency, and poor temporal consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose DiffVC-RT, the first framework designed to achieve real-time diffusion-based perceptual NVC. First, we introduce an Efficient and Informative Model Architecture. Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss. Second, to address generative flickering artifacts, we propose Explicit and Implicit Consistency Modeling. We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints. Finally, we present an Asynchronous and Parallel Decoding Pipeline incorporating Mixed Half Precision, which enables asynchronous latent decoding and parallel frame reconstruction via a Batch-dimension Temporal Shift design. Experiments show that DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in terms of LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 206 / 30 fps for 720p videos on an NVIDIA H800 GPU, marking a significant milestone in diffusion-based video compression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20597v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20598v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in computer vision. This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets. Our results show a clear split: supervised models dominate their training domain but crumble on cross-domain data. Language-aligned models, however, show surprising robustness cross-domain for ReID tasks, even though they are not explicitly trained to do so.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20650v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-horizon, repetitive workflows are common in professional settings, such as processing expense reports from receipts and entering student grades from exam papers. These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method. Project website: https://os-marathon.github.io/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20656v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face morphing attacks present a significant threat to face recognition systems used in electronic identity enrolment and border control, particularly in single-image morphing attack detection (S-MAD) scenarios where no trusted reference is available. In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features. These findings indicate that Fourier-domain residual modeling with structured regional fusion offers a competitive alternative to deep S-MAD architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Skill assessment in procedural videos is crucial for the objective evaluation of human performance in settings such as manufacturing and procedural daily tasks. Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prompt learning (PL) has emerged as an effective strategy to adapt vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for downstream tasks under limited supervision. While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average. Codes are available at https://github.com/ipankhi/BiMoRS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20689v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in image quality assessment (IQA) tasks. However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress across vision, audio, and language tasks, yet their performance on long-form, knowledge-intensive, and temporally structured educational content remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMON, a Lecture-based Evaluation benchmark for MultimOdal uNderstanding, focusing on STEM lecture videos that require long-horizon reasoning and cross-modal integration. LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning. It further encompasses six major tasks and twelve subtasks, covering the full cognitive spectrum from perception to reasoning and then to generation. Comprehensive experiments reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, highlighting that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction. We expect LEMON to serve as an extensible and challenging benchmark for advancing multimodal perception, reasoning, and generation in long-form instructional contents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20720v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20742v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: "Compression Tells Intelligence", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved rapid progress, yet their demographic biases, particularly gender bias, remain largely unexplored. We present FairT2V, a training-free debiasing framework for text-to-video generation that mitigates encoder-induced bias without finetuning. We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.   Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification. Experiments on the modern T2V model Open-Sora show that FairT2V substantially reduces demographic bias across occupations with minimal impact on video quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20835v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Road surface classification (RSC) is a key enabler for environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have advanced novel view synthesis, yet still rely on dense inputs and often degrade at extrapolated views. Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19936v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The opacity of massive pretraining corpora in Large Language Models (LLMs) raises significant privacy and copyright concerns, making pretraining data detection a critical challenge. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19938v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is a serverless collaborative machine learning paradigm where devices collaborate directly with neighbouring devices to exchange model information for learning a generalized model. However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19939v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Oculomics - the concept of predicting systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, through retinal imaging - has advanced rapidly due to the data efficiency of transformer-based foundation models like RETFound. Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Among hardware accelerators for deep-learning inference, data flow implementations offer low latency and high throughput capabilities. In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19942v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the emergence of multi-step reasoning in deep Transformer language models through a geometric and statistical-physics lens. Treating the hidden-state trajectory as a flow on an implicit Riemannian manifold, we analyze the layerwise covariance spectrum of activations, where $C^{(\ell)}=\mathbb{E}[h^{(\ell)}h^{(\ell)\top}]$, and track deviations from a random-matrix bulk. Across model scales (1.5B--30B), we observe a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality consistent with a phase transition: an order parameter based on sparsity/localization, $\Omega(h)=1-\|h\|_1/(\sqrt{d}\|h\|_2)$, exhibits a discontinuity near a critical normalized depth $\gamma_c\approx 0.42$ in sufficiently large models. We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable "concept basins" to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs). We provide theoretical conditions connecting logical separability to spectral decay and validate the predicted signatures with layerwise probes on multiple open-weight model families.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? We demonstrate that competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization -- learners spontaneously partition into specialists for different environmental regimes through competitive dynamics, consistent with ecological niche theory. We introduce the NichePopulation algorithm, a simple mechanism combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. Validated across six real-world domains (cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality), our approach achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with effect sizes of Cohen's d > 20. Key findings: (1) At lambda=0 (no niche bonus), learners still achieve SI > 0.30, proving specialization is genuinely emergent; (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5% through method-level division of labor; (3) Our approach outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19944v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study model-agnostic post-hoc calibration methods intended to improve probabilistic predictions in supervised binary classification on real i.i.d. tabular data, with particular emphasis on conformal and Venn-based approaches that provide distribution-free validity guarantees under exchangeability. We benchmark 21 widely used classifiers, including linear models, SVMs, tree ensembles (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM), and modern tabular neural and foundation models, on binary tasks from the TabArena-v0.1 suite using randomized, stratified five-fold cross-validation with a held-out test fold. Five calibrators; Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify are trained on a separate calibration split and applied to test predictions. Calibration is evaluated using proper scoring rules (log-loss and Brier score) and diagnostic measures (Spiegelhalter's Z, ECE, and ECI), alongside discrimination (AUC-ROC) and standard classification metrics. Across tasks and architectures, Venn-Abers predictors achieve the largest average reductions in log-loss, followed closely by Beta calibration, while Platt scaling exhibits weaker and less consistent effects. Beta calibration improves log-loss most frequently across tasks, whereas Venn-Abers displays fewer instances of extreme degradation and slightly more instances of extreme improvement. Importantly, we find that commonly used calibration procedures, most notably Platt scaling and isotonic regression, can systematically degrade proper scoring performance for strong modern tabular models. Overall classification performance is often preserved, but calibration effects vary substantially across datasets and architectures, and no method dominates uniformly. In expectation, all methods except Pearsonify slightly increase accuracy, but the effect is marginal, with the largest expected gain about 0.008%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19947v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning from Noisy Labels (LNL) presents a fundamental challenge in deep learning, as real-world datasets often contain erroneous or corrupted annotations, \textit{e.g.}, data crawled from Web. Current research focuses on sophisticated label correction mechanisms. In contrast, this paper adopts a novel perspective by establishing a theoretical analysis the relationship between flatness of the loss landscape and the presence of label noise. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that carefully simulated label noise synergistically enhances both the generalization performance and robustness of label noises. Consequently, we propose Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM) to leverage the perturbation of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to remedy the damage of label noises. Our analysis reveals that the testing accuracy exhibits a similar behavior that has been observed on the noise-clear dataset. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches on diverse tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19953v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Extending the intelligence of sensors to the data-acquisition process - deciding whether to sample or not - can result in transformative energy-efficiency gains. However, making such a decision in a deterministic manner involves risk of losing information. Here we present a sensing paradigm that enables making such a decision in a probabilistic manner. The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19961v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present MeanCache, a training-free caching framework for efficient Flow Matching inference. Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity recorded by implanted electrodes is a major challenge for invasive Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as decoders trained on data from one session often fail to generalize to subsequent sessions. This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19965v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In industrial recommender systems, conversion rate (CVR) is widely used for traffic allocation, but it fails to fully reflect recommendation effectiveness because it ignores refund behavior. To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/alimama-tech/NetCVR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19967v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collecting web data to train deep models has become increasingly common, raising concerns about unauthorized data usage. To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industrial image anomaly detection is a challenging problem owing to extreme class imbalance and the scarcity of labeled defective samples, particularly in few-shot settings. We propose BayPrAnoMeta, a Bayesian generalization of Proto-MAML for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection. Unlike existing Proto-MAML approaches that rely on deterministic class prototypes and distance-based adaptation, BayPrAnoMeta replaces prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models and performs inner-loop adaptation via a Bayesian posterior predictive likelihood. We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Linear Representation Hypothesis asserts that the embeddings learned by neural networks can be understood as linear combinations of features corresponding to high-level concepts. Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn "split dictionaries", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20037v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of tabular data in high-stakes domains, traditional deep learning architectures often struggle to match the performance of gradient-boosted decision trees while maintaining scientific interpretability. Standard neural networks typically treat features as independent entities, failing to exploit the inherent manifold structural dependencies that define tabular distributions. We propose Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN), a novel architecture that imposes a Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via a differentiable structural prior. StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing "laws" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalized virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) on edge devices are attracting growing attention, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key method for personalization by retrieving relevant profile data and generating tailored responses. However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) assumes uniform smoothness across the search space an assumption violated in multi-regime problems such as molecular conformation search through distinct energy basins or drug discovery across heterogeneous molecular scaffolds. A single GP either oversmooths sharp transitions or hallucinates noise in smooth regions, yielding miscalibrated uncertainty. We propose RAMBO, a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes that automatically discovers latent regimes during optimization, each modeled by an independent GP with locally-optimized hyperparameters. We derive collapsed Gibbs sampling that analytically marginalizes latent functions for efficient inference, and introduce adaptive concentration parameter scheduling for coarse-to-fine regime discovery. Our acquisition functions decompose uncertainty into intra-regime and inter-regime components. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, including molecular conformer optimization, virtual screening for drug discovery, and fusion reactor design, demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on multi-regime objectives.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis and heterogeneous treatment response. In this work, we developed and externally validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations. These results suggest that longitudinal routine clinical markers can estimate short-horizon mortality risk in mCRPC and support proactive care planning over a multi-month window.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training a single network with multiple objectives often leads to conflicting gradients that degrade shared representations, forcing them into a compromised state that is suboptimal for any single task--a problem we term latent representation collapse. We introduce Domain Expansion, a framework that prevents these conflicts by restructuring the latent space itself. Our framework uses a novel orthogonal pooling mechanism to construct a latent space where each objective is assigned to a mutually orthogonal subspace. We validate our approach across diverse benchmarks--including ShapeNet, MPIIGaze, and Rotated MNIST--on challenging multi-objective problems combining classification with pose and gaze estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that this structure not only prevents collapse but also yields an explicit, interpretable, and compositional latent space where concepts can be directly manipulated.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient-regularized value learning methods improve sample efficiency by leveraging learned models of transition dynamics and rewards to estimate return gradients. However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20079v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) are compact and transportable nuclear power systems exhibiting inherent safety, well-suited for deployment in remote regions where access is limited and reliance on costly fossil fuels is prevalent. In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{\Delta h}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{\Delta h}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain. Further improvements are anticipated through constraint relaxation and surrogate development, constituting an ongoing area of investigation.

QAD distills a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model using a KL divergence loss. While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1. It shows remarkable effectiveness and stability for models trained through multi-stage post-training pipelines, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and model merging, where traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) suffers from engineering complexity and training instability; 2. It is robust to data quality and coverage, enabling accuracy recovery without full training data. We evaluate QAD across multiple post-trained models including AceReason Nemotron, Nemotron 3 Nano, Nemotron Nano V2, Nemotron Nano V2 VL (VLM), and Llama Nemotron Super v1, showing consistent recovery to near-BF16 accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer models have achieved remarkable empirical successes, largely due to their in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20118v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To advance Polar code design for 6G applications, we develop a reinforcement learning-based universal sequence design framework that is extensible and adaptable to diverse channel conditions and decoding strategies. Crucially, our method scales to code lengths up to $2048$, making it suitable for use in standardization. Across all $(N,K)$ configurations supported in 5G, our approach achieves competitive performance relative to the NR sequence adopted in 5G and yields up to a 0.2 dB gain over the beta-expansion baseline at $N=2048$. We further highlight the key elements that enabled learning at scale: (i) incorporation of physical law constrained learning grounded in the universal partial order property of Polar codes, (ii) exploitation of the weak long term influence of decisions to limit lookahead evaluation, and (iii) joint multi-configuration optimization to increase learning efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since its introduction, Facebook Prophet has attracted positive attention from both classical statisticians and the Bayesian statistics community. The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20125v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) represent a promising alternative to autoregressive language models, using bidirectional masked token prediction. Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.

A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls. Code available at: https://github.com/ricsinaruto/brain-gen.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20154v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) have improved empirical performance by unleashing the power of unlabeled data for practical applications. Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pairwise-constrained clustering augments unsupervised partitioning with side information by enforcing must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints between specific samples, yielding labelings that respect known affinities and separations. However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prior work suggests that language models, while trained on next token prediction, show implicit planning behavior: they may select the next token in preparation to a predicted future token, such as a likely rhyming word, as supported by a prior qualitative study of Claude 3.5 Haiku using a cross-layer transcoder. We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. "-ight") or answer to a question ("whale") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to the rise of cardinality minimization in optimization, sparse support vector machines (SSVMs) have attracted much attention lately and show certain empirical advantages over convex SVMs. A common way to derive an SSVM is to add a cardinality function such as $\ell_0$-norm to the dual problem of a convex SVM. However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study. We further conduct numerical tests on real datasets and demonstrate potential advantages of SSVM by working with locally nice solutions proposed in this paper.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20172v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study how neural emulators of partial differential equation solution operators internalize physical symmetries by introducing an influence-based diagnostic that measures the propagation of parameter updates between symmetry-related states, defined as the metric-weighted overlap of loss gradients evaluated along group orbits. This quantity probes the local geometry of the learned loss landscape and goes beyond forward-pass equivariance tests by directly assessing whether learning dynamics couple physically equivalent configurations. Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin. The result is a novel technique for evaluating if surrogate models have internalized symmetry properties of the known solution operator.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a new nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, MAPLE, that enhances UMAP by improving manifold modeling. MAPLE employs a self-supervised learning approach to more efficiently encode low-dimensional manifold geometry. Central to this approach are maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs), which help untangle complex manifolds by compressing variances among locally similar data points while amplifying variance among dissimilar data points. This design is particularly effective for high-dimensional data with substantial intra-cluster variance and curved manifold structures, such as biological or image data. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MAPLE can produce clearer visual cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution than UMAP while maintaining comparable computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20174v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) are integral for many fields across science and engineering. Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in real-world classification, where test distributions often differ substantially from training data. Most existing approaches pursue domain-invariant representations, implicitly assuming that invariance implies reliability. However, features that are invariant across domains are not necessarily causally effective for prediction.   In this work, we revisit OOD classification from a causal perspective and propose to evaluate learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift. We introduce an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone.   Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts, highlighting the value of causal evaluation for robust generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20180v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Performative prediction captures the phenomenon where deploying a predictive model shifts the underlying data distribution. While simple retraining dynamics are known to converge linearly when the performative effects are weak ($\rho < 1$), the complexity in the regime $\rho > 1$ was hitherto open. In this paper, we establish a sharp phase transition: computing an $\epsilon$-performatively stable point is PPAD-complete -- and thus polynomial-time equivalent to Nash equilibria in general-sum games -- even when $\rho = 1 + O(\epsilon)$. This intractability persists even in the ostensibly simple setting with a quadratic loss function and linear distribution shifts. One of our key technical contributions is to extend this PPAD-hardness result to general convex domains, which is of broader interest in the complexity of variational inequalities. Finally, we address the special case of strategic classification, showing that computing a strategic local optimum is PLS-hard.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20193v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning methods typically focus on suppressing unreliable experiences or corrupted rewards, but they lack the ability to reason about the reliability of their own learning process. As a result, such methods often either overreact to noise by becoming overly conservative or fail catastrophically when uncertainty accumulates.   In this work, we propose a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework that enables an agent to assess, regulate, and recover its learning behavior based on internally estimated reliability signals. The proposed method introduces a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), which modulates learning dynamics via fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery.   Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption demonstrate that recovery-enabled meta-cognitive control achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances align diffusion models with human preferences to increase aesthetic appeal and mitigate artifacts and biases. Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to "reward hacking". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has shown that machine-learned predictions can provably improve the performance of classic algorithms. In this work, we propose the first minimum-cost network flow algorithm augmented with a dual prediction. Our method is based on a classic minimum-cost flow algorithm, namely $\varepsilon$-relaxation. We provide time complexity bounds in terms of the infinity norm prediction error, which is both consistent and robust. We also prove sample complexity bounds for PAC-learning the prediction. We empirically validate our theoretical results on two applications of minimum-cost flow, i.e., traffic networks and chip escape routing, in which we learn a fixed prediction, and a feature-based neural network model to infer the prediction, respectively. Experimental results illustrate $12.74\times$ and $1.64\times$ average speedup on two applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers have emerged as an important tool in scaling up modern neural networks by decoupling total trainable parameters from activated parameters in the forward pass for each token. However, sparse MoEs add complexity to training due to (i) new trainable parameters (router weights) that, like all other parameter groups, require hyperparameter (HP) tuning; (ii) new architecture scale dimensions (number of and size of experts) that must be chosen and potentially taken large. To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis. When varying different model dimensions trained at a fixed token budget, we find empirically that our parameterization enables reliable HP transfer across models from 51M to over 2B total parameters. We further take HPs identified from sweeping small models on a short token horizon to train larger models on longer horizons and report performant model behaviors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20209v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose \textbf{Spark} (\textbf{S}trategic \textbf{P}olicy-\textbf{A}ware explo\textbf{R}ation via \textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We derive an accounting identity for predictive models that links accuracy with common fairness criteria. The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a "total unfairness budget." For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present two machine learning frameworks for forecasting aggregated curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20227v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inferring physical fields from sparse observations while strictly satisfying partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study black-box optimization of Lipschitz functions under noisy evaluations. Existing adaptive discretization methods implicitly avoid suboptimal regions but do not provide explicit certificates of optimality or measurable progress guarantees. We introduce \textbf{Certificate-Guided Pruning (CGP)}, which maintains an explicit \emph{active set} $A_t$ of potentially optimal points via confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes. Any point outside $A_t$ is certifiably suboptimal with high probability, and under a margin condition with near-optimality dimension $\alpha$, we prove $\Vol(A_t)$ shrinks at a controlled rate yielding sample complexity $\tildeO(\varepsilon^{-(2+\alpha)})$. We develop three extensions: CGP-Adaptive learns $L$ online with $O(\log T)$ overhead; CGP-TR scales to $d > 50$ via trust regions with local certificates; and CGP-Hybrid switches to GP refinement when local smoothness is detected. Experiments on 12 benchmarks ($d \in [2, 100]$) show CGP variants match or exceed strong baselines while providing principled stopping criteria via certificate volume.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, flow-based generative models have shown superior efficiency compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20255v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: SWE-bench has emerged as the premier benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on complex software engineering tasks. While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the "Long-Context Tax" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders ("reasonable hesitation"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power. This work provides both the theoretical foundation and practical tools for optimizing the latent potential of LLMs in complex engineering domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20257v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) shows promise for generative auto-bidding by capturing temporal dependencies, but suffers from two critical limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling among state, action, and return-to-go (RTG) sequences, and indiscriminate learning of optimal/suboptimal behaviors. To address these, we propose C2, a novel framework enhancing DT with two core innovations: (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) via cross-attention to strengthen inter-sequence correlation modeling; (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) incorporating budget and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) constraints for selective learning of optimal trajectories. Extensive offline evaluations on the AuctionNet dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains (up to 3.23\% over state-of-the-art GAVE) across diverse budget settings; ablation studies verify the complementary synergy of CLB and CL, confirming C2's superiority in auto-bidding. The code for reproducing our results is available at: https://github.com/Dingjinren/C2.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have enabled robust modeling of real-world dynamical processes across diverse domains, such as finance, health, and systems biology. However, parameter estimation for SDEs typically relies on accurately timestamped observational sequences. When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, extending parameter estimation to settings with missing temporal order and broadening applicability in sensitive domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting has long been dominated by advances in model architecture, with recent progress driven by deep learning and hybrid statistical techniques. However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $\delta$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $\delta$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(\delta)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage. Our experiments across diverse backbones and datasets show that $\delta$-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration with negligible compute and no interface changes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large language models (LLMs) remains an evolving field with many unresolved questions, increasing regulatory pressures have spurred interest in its role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and privacy-preserving machine unlearning. Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20291v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.

In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20299v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20332v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, but inference requires full-sequence attention at every iteration, resulting in substantial redundant computation on masked tokens. Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textbf{\placeholder}\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference. We maintain a local computation window that slides rightward as denoising progresses, and partition undecoded tokens into: (i) \textit{active tokens} that are computed online, (ii) \textit{buffer tokens} whose KV states are cached and periodically refreshed, and (iii) \textit{far-field tokens} that are pruned outside the window. Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage. Experiments on LLaDA and Dream show that, under matched compute budgets, our method achieves up to $99\times$ inference speedup while largely preserving generation performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods. Code and custom-trained models are available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/TABED.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20361v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning a mesh-free, differentiable solution that can be evaluated anywhere in space and time. However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method. Experiments on various time-dependent PDEs show up to $4\times$ improved accuracy and $10\times$ faster convergence compared to PINNs and strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20363v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20367v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying safety-critical scenarios is essential for autonomous driving, but the rarity of such events makes supervised labeling impractical. Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20375v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) aims to ensure effective and privacy-preserving collaboration among different entities. As newly joined clients require significant adjustments and additional training to align with the existing system, the problem of generalizing federated learning models to unseen clients under heterogeneous data has become progressively crucial. Consequently, we highlight two unsolved challenging issues in federated domain generalization: Optimization Divergence and Performance Divergence. To tackle the above challenges, we propose FedRD, a novel heterogeneity-aware federated learning algorithm that collaboratively utilizes parameter-guided global generalization aggregation and local debiased classification to reduce divergences, aiming to obtain an optimal global model for participating and unseen clients. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem.

This paper introduces ScatterFusion, a novel framework that synergistically integrates scattering transforms with hierarchical attention mechanisms for robust time series forecasting. Our approach comprises four key components: (1) a Hierarchical Scattering Transform Module (HSTM) that extracts multi-scale invariant features capturing both local and global patterns; (2) a Scale-Adaptive Feature Enhancement (SAFE) module that dynamically adjusts feature importance across different scales; (3) a Multi-Resolution Temporal Attention (MRTA) mechanism that learns dependencies at varying time horizons; and (4) a Trend-Seasonal-Residual (TSR) decomposition-guided structure-aware loss function. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that ScatterFusion outperforms other common methods, achieving significant reductions in error metrics across various prediction horizons.

This paper introduces AWGformer, a novel architecture that integrates adaptive wavelet decomposition with cross-scale attention mechanisms for enhanced multi-variate time series prediction. Our approach comprises: (1) an Adaptive Wavelet Decomposition Module (AWDM) that dynamically selects optimal wavelet bases and decomposition levels based on signal characteristics; (2) a Cross-Scale Feature Fusion (CSFF) mechanism that captures interactions between different frequency bands through learnable coupling matrices; (3) a Frequency-Aware Multi-Head Attention (FAMA) module that weights attention heads according to their frequency selectivity; (4) a Hierarchical Prediction Network (HPN) that generates forecasts at multiple resolutions before reconstruction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AWGformer achieves significant average improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with particular effectiveness on multi-scale and non-stationary time series. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and establishes the connection between our wavelet-guided attention and classical signal processing principles.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20420v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing human understandable interpretation of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly critical for their deployment in essential domains. Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20428v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Map is a spectral dimensionality reduction technique which is able to uncover nonlinear submanifolds in high-dimensional data. And, it is increasingly applied across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as biology, engineering, and social sciences. But data preprocessing, parameter settings and component selection have a significant influence on the resulting manifold, something which has not been comprehensively discussed in the literature so far. We provide a practice oriented review of the Diffusion Map technique, illustrate pitfalls and showcase a recently introduced technique for identifying the most relevant components. Our results show that the first components are not necessarily the most relevant ones.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent lightweight MLP-based models have achieved strong performance in time series forecasting by capturing stable trends and seasonal patterns. However, their effectiveness hinges on an implicit assumption of local stationarity assumption, making them prone to errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series, especially when abrupt fluctuations occur, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring. To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from traffic, financial, energy, and weather domains show that TimeCatcher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ColaPrinceCHEN/TimeCatcher.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.

We model classification as a set of binary tests between class-conditional distributions of representations and empirically show that, along training trajectories, well-generalizing networks increasingly align with Neyman-Pearson optimal decision rules via monotonic improvements in KL divergence that relate to error rate exponents. We finally discuss how this yields an explanation and possible training or regularization strategies for different classes of neural networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20480v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Topological deep learning has emerged for modeling higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions that standard graph neural networks fail to capture. Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20556v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised ensemble learning emerged to address the challenge of combining multiple learners' predictions without access to ground truth labels or additional data. This paradigm is crucial in scenarios where evaluating individual classifier performance or understanding their strengths is challenging due to limited information. We propose a novel deep energy-based method for constructing an accurate meta-learner using only the predictions of individual learners, potentially capable of capturing complex dependence structures between them. Our approach requires no labeled data, learner features, or problem-specific information, and has theoretical guarantees for when learners are conditionally independent. We demonstrate superior performance across diverse ensemble scenarios, including challenging mixture of experts settings. Our experiments span standard ensemble datasets and curated datasets designed to test how the model fuses expertise from multiple sources. These results highlight the potential of unsupervised ensemble learning to harness collective intelligence, especially in data-scarce or privacy-sensitive environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: During pretraining, LLMs inadvertently memorize sensitive or copyrighted data, posing significant compliance challenges under legal frameworks like the GDPR and the EU AI Act. Fulfilling these mandates demands techniques that can remove information from a deployed model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning approaches attempt to address this need, but often leak the very data they aim to erase, sacrifice fluency and robustness, or depend on costly external reward models. We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Specifications for decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices require algorithms that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and lightweight in memory usage. While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ordinal regression and ranking are challenging due to inherent ordinal dependencies that conventional methods struggle to model. We propose Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that explicitly learns these relationships. At its core, RARL features a unified objective that synergistically integrates regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R), enabling mutual improvement between the two tasks. This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization. To further enhance training, we introduce Response Mutation Operations (RMO), which inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent stagnation at saddle points. The effectiveness of RARL is validated through extensive experiments on three distinct benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient temporal-difference (GTD) learning algorithms are widely used for off-policy policy evaluation with function approximation. However, existing convergence analyses rely on the restrictive assumption that the so-called feature interaction matrix (FIM) is nonsingular. In practice, the FIM can become singular and leads to instability or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization objective by reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization. This formulation naturally yields a regularized GTD algorithms, referred to as R-GTD, which guarantees convergence to a unique solution even when the FIM is singular. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds for the proposed method, and validate its effectiveness through empirical experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in civilian and industrial applications, making secure low-altitude operations crucial. In dense mmWave environments, accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs as either inside authorized or restricted airspaces remains challenging, requiring models that handle complex propagation and signal variability. This paper proposes a deep learning model, referred to as CoBA, which stands for integrated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention which leverages Fifth Generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio measurements to classify UAV operations in authorized and restricted airspaces at low altitude. The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios. The model is evaluated against conventional ML models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark. Experimental results show that CoBA achieves superior accuracy, significantly outperforming all baseline models and demonstrating its potential for reliable and regulated UAV airspace monitoring.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing dynamical evolution from limited observations is a fundamental challenge in single-cell biology, where dynamic unbalanced optimal transport provides a principled framework for modeling coupled transport and mass variation. However, existing approaches rely on trajectory simulation at inference time, making inference a key bottleneck for scalable applications. In this work, we propose a mean-flow framework for unbalanced flow matching that summarizes both transport and mass-growth dynamics over arbitrary time intervals using mean velocity and mass-growth fields, enabling fast one-step generation without trajectory simulation. To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20611v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) faces challenges in modeling complex intra-channel temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations. Although recent research has highlighted the efficiency of linear architectures in capturing global trends, these models often struggle with non-linear signals. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic receptive field analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) TSF models. We introduce the "individual receptive field" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20627v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose DIVERSE, a framework for systematically exploring the Rashomon set of deep neural networks, the collection of models that match a reference model's accuracy while differing in their predictive behavior. DIVERSE augments a pretrained model with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers and uses Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to search a latent modulation space, generating diverse model variants without retraining or gradient access. Across MNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, and CIFAR-10, DIVERSE uncovers multiple high-performing yet functionally distinct models. Our experiments show that DIVERSE offers a competitive and efficient exploration of the Rashomon set, making it feasible to construct diverse sets that maintain robustness and performance while supporting well-balanced model multiplicity. While retraining remains the baseline to generate Rashomon sets, DIVERSE achieves comparable diversity at reduced computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Virtual sensors use machine learning to predict target signals from available measurements, replacing expensive physical sensors in critical applications. Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks. At the same time, emerging time series foundation models are computationally expensive and limited to predicting their input signals, making them incompatible with virtual sensors. We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines. Our model scales gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with nearly constant parameter count, enabling practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately modelling the dynamics of complex systems and discovering their governing differential equations are critical tasks for accelerating scientific discovery. Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20642v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles. Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) is a critical task in time series analysis, aiming to identify moments when the underlying data-generating process shifts. Traditional CPD methods often rely on unsupervised techniques, which lack adaptability to task-specific definitions of change and cannot benefit from user knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose MuRAL-CPD, a novel semi-supervised method that integrates active learning into a multiresolution CPD algorithm. MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters. This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MuRAL-CPD against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where minimal supervision is available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20687v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to constraints on privacy, cost, and latency, on-premise deployment of small models is increasingly common. However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20692v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group counterfactual explanations find a set of counterfactual instances to explain a group of input instances contrastively. However, existing methods either (i) optimize counterfactuals only for a fixed group and do not generalize to new group members, (ii) strictly rely on strong model assumptions (e.g., linearity) for tractability or/and (iii) poorly control the counterfactual group geometry distortion. We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...). Experiments show that they accurately generalize, preserve group geometry and incur only negligible additional transport cost compared to baseline methods. If model linearity cannot be exploited, our approach also significantly outperforms the baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Exogenous MDPs (Exo-MDPs) capture sequential decision-making where uncertainty comes solely from exogenous inputs that evolve independently of the learner's actions. This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\widetilde{O}(H^2|\Xi|\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20704v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to curate bibliographies, raising the question: are their reference lists distinguishable from human ones? We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in real-world applications where environmental conditions are non-stationary, particularly when reward functions shift or the available action space expands. This paper introduces MORPHIN, a self-adaptive Q-learning framework that enables on-the-fly adaptation without full retraining. By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our approach using a Gridworld benchmark and a traffic signal control simulation. The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model is widely used in survival analysis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed. However, training these Cox models with high-dimensional features typically requires a substantial number of labeled samples containing information about time-to-event. The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model. In summary, the Cox-MT model effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to significantly enhance prediction accuracy compared to existing ANN-based Cox models trained solely on labeled data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time-introducing new domains or resolutions-agents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $\alpha=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $\alpha=1$. For non-convex objectives and $\delta$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((\eta,\eta_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $\rho_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $\alpha$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20745v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20753v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20756v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A fundamental challenge in offline reinforcement learning is distributional shift. Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20772v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: COMET-SG1 is a lightweight, stability-oriented autoregressive regression model designed for time-series prediction on edge and embedded AI systems. Unlike recurrent neural networks or transformer-based sequence models, COMET-SG1 operates through linear behavior-space encoding, memory-anchored transition estimation, and deterministic state updates. This structure prioritizes bounded long-horizon behavior under fully autoregressive inference, a critical requirement for edge deployment where prediction errors accumulate over time. Experiments on non-stationary synthetic time-series data demonstrate that COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy while exhibiting significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines. With a compact parameter footprint and operations compatible with fixed-point arithmetic, COMET-SG1 provides a practical and interpretable approach for stable autoregressive prediction in edge and embedded AI applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deployed machine learning systems must continuously evolve as data, architectures, and regulations change, often without access to original training data or model internals. In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $\alpha$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with H\"older/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multitask learning and related frameworks have achieved tremendous success in modern applications. In multitask learning problem, we are given a set of heterogeneous datasets collected from related source tasks and hope to enhance the performance above what we could hope to achieve by solving each of them individually. The recent work of arXiv:2006.15785 has showed that, without access to distributional information, no algorithm based on aggregating samples alone can guarantee optimal risk as long as the sample size per task is bounded.   In this paper, we focus on understanding the statistical limits of multitask learning. We go beyond the no-free-lunch theorem in arXiv:2006.15785 by establishing a stronger impossibility result of adaptation that holds for arbitrarily large sample size per task. This improvement conveys an important message that the hardness of multitask learning cannot be overcame by having abundant data per task. We also discuss the notion of optimal adaptivity that may be of future interests.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers. We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $\epsilon$ is close to optimal.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose conditional PED-ANOVA (condPED-ANOVA), a principled framework for estimating hyperparameter importance (HPI) in conditional search spaces, where the presence or domain of a hyperparameter can depend on other hyperparameters. Although the original PED-ANOVA provides a fast and efficient way to estimate HPI within the top-performing regions of the search space, it assumes a fixed, unconditional search space and therefore cannot properly handle conditional hyperparameters. To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes. Experiments show that naive adaptations of existing HPI estimators yield misleading or uninterpretable importance estimates in conditional settings, whereas condPED-ANOVA consistently provides meaningful importances that reflect the underlying conditional structure.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20802v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20815v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are fundamental for understanding the model's inner workings and for identifying potential misuse of sensitive attributes. Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings. Our code is available in the supplemental.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20829v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper studies the minimal dimension required to embed subset memberships ($m$ elements and ${m\choose k}$ subsets of at most $k$ elements) into vector spaces, denoted as Minimal Embeddable Dimension (MED). The tight bounds of MED are derived theoretically and supported empirically for various notions of "distances" or "similarities," including the $\ell_2$ metric, inner product, and cosine similarity. In addition, we conduct numerical simulation in a more achievable setting, where the ${m\choose k}$ subset embeddings are chosen as the centroid of the embeddings of the contained elements. Our simulation easily realizes a logarithmic dependency between the MED and the number of elements to embed. These findings imply that embedding-based retrieval limitations stem primarily from learnability challenges, not geometric constraints, guiding future algorithm design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem with applications in climate, energy, healthcare, and finance. Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/weixinchen98/Cofair.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20852v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional machine learning systems are typically designed for static data distributions, which suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning from evolving data streams. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems. The code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/C3Box.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models. In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20048v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20090v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20305v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20323v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20379v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20380v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20467v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20539v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20554v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $\alpha$, where $\alpha = 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $\alpha < 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20604v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.   Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.   Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.   The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20614v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20641v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems such as the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Knapsack Problem (KP) are fundamental challenges in operations research, logistics, and eterprise resource planning (ERP). These problems often require sophisticated algorithms to achieve near-optimal solutions within practical time constraints. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced transformer-based architectures as promising alternatives to traditional heuristics and metaheuristics. We leverage the Multi-Type Transformer (MTT) architecture to address these benchmarks in a unified framework. We present an extensive experimental evaluation across standard benchmark datasets for JSP and KP, demonstrating that MTT achieves competitive performance on different size of these benchmark problems. We showcase the potential of multi-type attention on a real application in Ferro-Titanium industry. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply multi-type transformers in real manufacturing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20735v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neuro-symbolic AI systems integrate neural perception with symbolic reasoning to enable data-efficient, interpretable, and robust intelligence beyond purely neural models. Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.   This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20831v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head \mu that acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of \mu, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on \mu-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that \mu-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by \mu, noting the superior performance of \mu augmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Deep Researcher architecture designed to generate detailed research reports on complex PhD level topics by addressing the inherent limitations of the Parallel Scaling paradigm. Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard. This performance marginally exceeds our previous work, Static DRA, and reinforces the finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self consistency paradigm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20856v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although the capabilities of large language models have been increasingly tested on complex reasoning tasks, their long-horizon planning abilities have not yet been extensively investigated. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human-in-the-loop guidance has emerged as an effective approach for enabling faster convergence in online reinforcement learning (RL) of complex real-world manipulation tasks. However, existing human-in-the-loop RL (HiL-RL) frameworks often suffer from low sample efficiency, requiring substantial human interventions to achieve convergence and thereby leading to high labor costs. To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \method achieves a 42.1\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.19972v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In high-dimensional robotic path planning, traditional sampling-based methods often struggle to efficiently identify both feasible and optimal paths in complex, multi-obstacle environments. This challenge is intensified in robotic manipulators, where the risk of kinematic singularities and self-collisions further complicates motion efficiency and safety. To address these issues, we introduce the Just-in-Time Informed Trees (JIT*) algorithm, an enhancement over Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), designed to improve path planning through two core modules: the Just-in-Time module and the Motion Performance module. The Just-in-Time module includes "Just-in-Time Edge," which dynamically refines edge connectivity, and "Just-in-Time Sample," which adjusts sampling density in bottleneck areas to enable faster initial path discovery. The Motion Performance module balances manipulability and trajectory cost through dynamic switching, optimizing motion control while reducing the risk of singularities. Comparative analysis shows that JIT* consistently outperforms traditional sampling-based planners across $\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\mathbb{R}^{16}$ dimensions. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated in single-arm and dual-arm manipulation tasks, with experimental results available in a video at https://youtu.be/nL1BMHpMR7c.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20130v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time execution is essential for cyber-physical systems such as robots. These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method enables faster task execution, maintains robustness across varying delays, and consistently achieves higher completion rates.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20149v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric Bayesian models for regression of scalar fields, formulated under the assumption that measurement locations are perfectly known and the corresponding field measurements have Gaussian noise. However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20208v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The central challenge in robotic manipulation of deformable objects lies in aligning high-level semantic instructions with physical interaction points under complex appearance and texture variations. Due to near-infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and heterogeneous patterns, existing vision-based affordance prediction methods often suffer from boundary overflow and fragmented functional regions. To address these issues, we propose TRACER, a Texture-Robust Affordance Chain-of-thought with dEformable-object Refinement framework, which establishes a cross-hierarchical mapping from hierarchical semantic reasoning to appearance-robust and physically consistent functional region refinement. Specifically, a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought (TA-CoT) is formulated to decompose high-level task intentions into hierarchical sub-task semantics, providing consistent guidance across various execution stages. To ensure spatial integrity, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement (SCBR) mechanism is introduced to suppress prediction spillover, guiding the perceptual response to converge toward authentic interaction manifolds. Furthermore, an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow (ICRF) is developed to aggregate discrete pixels corrupted by appearance noise, significantly enhancing the spatial continuity and physical plausibility of the identified functional regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic platform demonstrate that TRACER significantly improves affordance grounding precision across diverse textures and patterns inherent to deformable objects. More importantly, it enhances the success rate of long-horizon tasks, effectively bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level physical execution. The source code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Dikay1/TRACER.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20239v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-grained and contact-rich manipulation remain challenging for robots, largely due to the underutilization of tactile feedback. To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20262v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing demand for real-time robotic deployment necessitates fast and on-device inference for vision-language-action (VLA) models. Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20321v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful generalists for robotic manipulation. However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20377v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual foundation models provide strong perceptual features for robotics, but their dense representations lack explicit object-level structure, limiting robustness and contractility in manipulation tasks. We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end. Our results highlight multi-phase adaptation as an efficient mechanism for transforming generic foundation model features into task-aware object-centric representations for robotic control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic prospecting for critical resources on the Moon, such as ilmenite, rare earth elements, and water ice, requires robust exploration methods given the diverse terrain and harsh environmental conditions. Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20555v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rich contact perception is crucial for robotic manipulation, yet traditional tactile skins remain expensive and complex to integrate. This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-robot systems have been widely deployed in real-world applications, providing significant improvements in efficiency and reductions in labor costs. However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20668v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) policies for legged robots remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous actions, hardware constraints, and limited exploration. Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance. These results suggest that GPO provides a general, environment-agnostic optimization framework for learning legged locomotion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20682v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tendon-driven anthropomorphic robotic hands often lack direct joint angle sensing, as the integration of joint encoders can compromise mechanical compactness and dexterity. This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach. The estimated joint angles are then employed for closed-loop control through a Jacobian-based proportional-integral (PI) controller augmented with a feedforward term, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing. The effectiveness and limitations of the proposed estimation and control framework are demonstrated in the MuJoCo simulation environment using the Anatomically Correct Biomechatronic Hand, featuring five degrees of freedom for each long finger and six degrees of freedom for the thumb.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20701v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time robotic control demands fast action generation. However, existing generative policies based on diffusion and flow matching require multi-step   sampling, fundamentally limiting deployment in time-critical scenarios. We propose Dispersive MeanFlow Policy Optimization (DMPO), a unified framework that   enables true one-step generation through three key components: MeanFlow for mathematically-derived single-step inference without knowledge distillation,   dispersive regularization to prevent representation collapse, and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to surpass expert demonstrations. Experiments   across RoboMimic manipulation and OpenAI Gym locomotion benchmarks demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to multi-step baselines. With   our lightweight model architecture and the three key algorithmic components working in synergy, DMPO exceeds real-time control requirements (>120Hz) with   5-20x inference speedup, reaching hundreds of Hertz on high-performance GPUs. Physical deployment on a Franka-Emika-Panda robot validates real-world   applicability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper rethinks steady-hand robotic manipulation by using a weakly supervised framework that fuses calibration-aware perception with admittance control. Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline. These results demonstrate that the weakly supervised agent improves the reliability of microscope-guided biomedical micromanipulation without introducing complex setup requirements, offering a practical framework for microscope-guided intervention.

The methodology encompasses several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and subtasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a knowledge graph, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A practical implementation within the Aerostack2 framework is demonstrated through a simulated search and rescue mission in a Gazebo environment, where drones autonomously locate a target. This implementation highlights the effectiveness of the methodology in improving decision-making and mission performance by leveraging knowledge graphs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.20846v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Whereas reinforcement learning has been applied with success to a range of robotic control problems in complex, uncertain environments, reliance on extensive data - typically sourced from simulation environments - limits real-world deployment due to the domain gap between simulated and physical systems, coupled with limited real-world sample availability. We propose a novel method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, based on a reinterpretation of neural style transfer from image processing to synthesise novel training data from unpaired unlabelled real world datasets. We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data. Our framework demonstrates robustness to geometric and material variation, and highlights the feasibility of policy adaptation in challenging contact-rich tasks where real-world reward information is unavailable.
