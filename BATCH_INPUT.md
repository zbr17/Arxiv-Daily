- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions. These findings establish baseline expectations and highlight the need for domain-adaptive approaches in aerial OVD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has become an important benchmark for assessing how large multimodal models (LMMs) interpret images. However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data. We release the open-source dataset, including figures, underlying data, distribution parameters used to generate the data, and bounding boxes for all figure marks and text for future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$). Moreover, VLMs exhibit difficulty in multi-image reasoning, with inconsistent performance (best $59.7\%$) when integrating spatial cues across frames. Our findings reveal limitations in grounding VLMs in 3D and multi-view spatial reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper revisits the role of positional embeddings (PEs) within vision transformers (ViTs) from a geometric perspective. We show that PEs are not mere token indices but effectively function as geometric priors that shape the spatial structure of the representation. We introduce token-level diagnostics that measure how multi-view geometric consistency in ViT representation depends on consitent PEs. Through extensive experiments on 14 foundation ViT models, we reveal how PEs influence multi-view geometry and spatial reasoning. Our findings clarify the role of PEs as a causal mechanism that governs spatial structure in ViT representations. Our code is provided in https://github.com/shijianjian/vit-geometry-probes

- 标题: Is Hierarchical Quantization Essential for Optimal Reconstruction?

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism severely limits the context scalability of Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). We find that the highly sparse spatio-temporal attention patterns exhibited in Video DiTs can be naturally represented by the Monarch matrix. It is a class of structured matrices with flexible sparsity, enabling sub-quadratic attention via an alternating minimization algorithm. Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22301v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional rendering pipelines rely on complex assets, accurate materials and lighting, and substantial computational resources to produce realistic imagery, yet they still face challenges in scalability and realism for populated dynamic scenes. We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input. We will release the model and project webpage at https://gonzalognogales.github.io/coarse2real/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22376v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps provide essential semantic information of road structures for autonomous driving systems, yet current HD map construction methods require calibrated multi-camera setups and either implicit or explicit 2D-to-BEV transformations, making them fragile when sensors fail or camera configurations vary across vehicle fleets. We introduce FlexMap, unlike prior methods that are fixed to a specific N-camera rig, our approach adapts to variable camera configurations without any architectural changes or per-configuration retraining. Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices. Experiments demonstrate that FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple configurations while maintaining robustness to missing views and sensor variations, enabling more practical real-world deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22398v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have become central to tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. However, their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt variations, which can reveal vulnerabilities in safety alignment. In this work, we present a jailbreak framework that exploits post-training Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct stealthy prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-strategy significantly improves ASR while maintaining naturalness in both text and visual domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22412v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video-based human movement analysis holds potential for movement assessment in clinical practice and research. However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite progress in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), object hallucination remains a critical issue in image captioning task, where models generate descriptions of non-existent objects, compromising their reliability. Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22455v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interactive 3D model texture editing presents enhanced opportunities for creating 3D assets, with freehand drawing style offering the most intuitive experience. However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22468v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has enabled high-quality visual synthesis with diffusion-based frameworks, supporting controllable sampling and large-scale training. Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) but remain limited in fine-grained reasoning due to low-resolution inputs and noisy attention aggregation. We propose \textbf{Head Aware Visual Cropping (HAVC)}, a training-free method that improves visual grounding by leveraging a selectively refined subset of attention heads. HAVC first filters heads through an OCR-based diagnostic task, ensuring that only those with genuine grounding ability are retained. At inference, these heads are further refined using spatial entropy for stronger spatial concentration and gradient sensitivity for predictive contribution. The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair. Extensive experiments on multiple fine-grained VQA benchmarks demonstrate that HAVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cropping strategies, achieving more precise localization, stronger visual grounding, providing a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing precision in MLLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22492v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in multi-class settings poses significant challenges due to the diversity of object categories, the scarcity of anomalous examples, and the presence of camouflaged defects. In this paper, we propose PromptMAD, a cross-modal prompting framework for unsupervised visual anomaly detection and localization that integrates semantic guidance through vision-language alignment. By leveraging CLIP-encoded text prompts describing both normal and anomalous class-specific characteristics, our method enriches visual reconstruction with semantic context, improving the detection of subtle and textural anomalies. To further address the challenge of class imbalance at the pixel level, we incorporate Focal loss function, which emphasizes hard-to-detect anomalous regions during training. Our architecture also includes a supervised segmentor that fuses multi-scale convolutional features with Transformer-based spatial attention and diffusion iterative refinement, yielding precise and high-resolution anomaly maps. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art pixel-level performance, improving mean AUC to 98.35% and AP to 66.54%, while maintaining efficiency across diverse categories.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthesizing personalized talking faces that uphold and highlight a speaker's unique style while maintaining lip-sync accuracy remains a significant challenge. A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MirrorTalk achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of lip-sync accuracy and personalization preservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22507v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven image generation using diffusion models have attracted considerable attention for their remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality images. Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm. DreamVAR further incorporates reinforcement learning to jointly enhance semantic alignment and subject consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamVAR achieves superior appearance preservation compared to leading diffusion-based methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22508v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) aims to retrieve a target video from a large gallery using a reference video and a textual query specifying visual modifications. However, existing benchmarks consider only visual changes, ignoring videos that differ in audio despite visual similarity. To address this limitation, we introduce Composed retrieval for Video with its Audio CoVA, a new retrieval task that accounts for both visual and auditory variations. To support this, we construct AV-Comp, a benchmark consisting of video pairs with cross-modal changes and corresponding textual queries that describe the differences. We also propose AVT Compositional Fusion (AVT), which integrates video, audio, and text features by selectively aligning the query to the most relevant modality. AVT outperforms traditional unimodal fusion and serves as a strong baseline for CoVA. Examples from the proposed dataset, including both visual and auditory information, are available at https://perceptualai-lab.github.io/CoVA/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As generative AI achieves hyper-realism, superficial artifact detection has become obsolete. While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22522v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Body condition score (BCS) is a widely used indicator of body energy status and is closely associated with metabolic status, reproductive performance, and health in dairy cattle; however, conventional visual scoring is subjective and labor-intensive. Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments. Its hierarchy-aware decoder better captures global 3D scene layouts, leading to improved semantic segmentation performance. Moreover, SHED enhances 3D reconstruction quality and reveals interpretable part-level structures that are often missed by conventional pixel-wise methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22551v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a hybrid cross-device localization pipeline developed for the CroCoDL 2025 Challenge. Our approach integrates a shared retrieval encoder and two complementary localization branches: a classical geometric branch using feature fusion and PnP, and a neural feed-forward branch (MapAnything) for metric localization conditioned on geometric inputs. A neural-guided candidate pruning strategy further filters unreliable map frames based on translation consistency, while depth-conditioned localization refines metric scale and translation precision on Spot scenes. These components jointly lead to significant improvements in recall and accuracy across both HYDRO and SUCCU benchmarks. Our method achieved a final score of 92.62 (R@0.5m, 5{\deg}) during the challenge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Selective prediction aims to endow predictors with a reject option, to avoid low confidence predictions. However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/kingston-aditya/MA-PaPSP.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22573v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: All-in-one weather image restoration methods are valuable in practice but depend on pre-collected data and require retraining for unseen degradations, leading to high cost. We propose DELNet, a continual learning framework for weather image restoration. DELNet integrates a judging valve that measures task similarity to distinguish new from known tasks, and a dynamic expert library that stores experts trained on different degradations. For new tasks, the valve selects top-k experts for knowledge transfer while adding new experts to capture task-specific features; for known tasks, the corresponding experts are directly reused. This design enables continuous optimization without retraining existing models. Experiments on OTS, Rain100H, and Snow100K demonstrate that DELNet surpasses state-of-the-art continual learning methods, achieving PSNR gains of 16\%, 11\%, and 12\%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of DELNet, which reduces retraining cost and enables practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although Video Large Language Models perform remarkably well across tasks such as video understanding, question answering, and reasoning, they still suffer from the problem of hallucination, which refers to generating outputs that are inconsistent with explicit video content or factual evidence. However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22575v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel at offline audio-visual understanding, but their ability to serve as mobile assistants in continuous real-world streams remains underexplored. In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/PhoStream.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22581v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) for hyper-spectral image (HSI) classification has attracted significant research interest, existing works often rely on an unrealistic data augmentation procedure in the form of external noise to enlarge the sample size, thus greatly simplifying the issue of data scarcity. They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22596v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce FOTBCD, a large-scale building change detection dataset derived from authoritative French orthophotos and topographic building data provided by IGN France. Unlike existing benchmarks that are geographically constrained to single cities or limited regions, FOTBCD spans 28 departments across mainland France, with 25 used for training and three geographically disjoint departments held out for evaluation. The dataset covers diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments at 0.2m/pixel resolution. We publicly release FOTBCD-Binary, a dataset comprising approximately 28,000 before/after image pairs with pixel-wise binary building change masks, each associated with patch-level spatial metadata. The dataset is designed for large-scale benchmarking and evaluation under geographic domain shift, with validation and test samples drawn from held-out departments and manually verified to ensure label quality. In addition, we publicly release FOTBCD-Instances, a publicly available instance-level annotated subset comprising several thousand image pairs, which illustrates the complete annotation schema used in the full instance-level version of FOTBCD. Using a fixed reference baseline, we benchmark FOTBCD-Binary against LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD, providing strong empirical evidence that geographic diversity at the dataset level is associated with improved cross-domain generalization in building change detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22615v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Streaming recurrent models enable efficient 3D reconstruction by maintaining persistent state representations. However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability. Our codes will be available soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing adoption of robotics and augmented reality in real-world applications has driven considerable research interest in 3D object detection based on point clouds. While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information. Extensive experiments on six different indoor scene datasets clearly validate the superior performance of our method.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22630v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive models with continuous tokens form a promising paradigm for visual generation, especially for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, but they suffer from high computational cost. We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.   Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.   We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.   Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/techmonsterwang/LINA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Semantic Gap Problem (SGP) in Computer Vision (CV) arises from the misalignment between visual and lexical semantics leading to flawed CV dataset design and CV benchmarks. This paper proposes that classification principles of S.R. Ranganathan can offer a principled starting point to address SGP and design high-quality CV datasets. We elucidate how these principles, suitably adapted, underpin the vTelos CV annotation methodology. The paper also briefly presents experimental evidence showing improvements in CV annotation and accuracy, thereby, validating vTelos.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the quality of synthetic images improves, identifying the underlying concepts of model-generated images is becoming increasingly crucial for copyright protection and ensuring model transparency. Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attention-based soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 AP$_r$ on the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference-efficient.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22674v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction in vision due to their energy efficiency, bio-plausibility, and inherent temporal processing. Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22680v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce the Visual Personalization Turing Test (VPTT), a new paradigm for evaluating contextual visual personalization based on perceptual indistinguishability, rather than identity replication. A model passes the VPTT if its output (image, video, 3D asset, etc.) is indistinguishable to a human or calibrated VLM judge from content a given person might plausibly create or share. To operationalize VPTT, we present the VPTT Framework, integrating a 10k-persona benchmark (VPTT-Bench), a visual retrieval-augmented generator (VPRAG), and the VPTT Score, a text-only metric calibrated against human and VLM judgments. We show high correlation across human, VLM, and VPTT evaluations, validating the VPTT Score as a reliable perceptual proxy. Experiments demonstrate that VPRAG achieves the best alignment-originality balance, offering a scalable and privacy-safe foundation for personalized generative AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22685v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot out-of-vocabulary detection (ZS-OOVD) aims to accurately recognize objects of in-vocabulary (IV) categories provided at zero-shot inference, while simultaneously rejecting undefined ones (out-of-vocabulary, OOV) that lack corresponding category prompts. However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.   Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes. The code is available at https://github.com/binyisu/OOV-detector.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing detailed 3D human meshes from a single in-the-wild image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong zero-shot performance via large-scale image-text pretraining and have been widely adopted in medical image analysis. However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22703v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is a critical safeguard for deploying machine learning models in the real world. However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP. Extensive evaluations show DAVIS sets a new benchmark across diverse architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. It achieves significant reductions in the false positive rate (FPR95), with improvements of 48.26\% on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, 38.13\% on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-34, and 26.83\% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using MobileNet-v2. Our analysis reveals the underlying mechanism for this improvement, providing a principled basis for moving beyond the mean in OOD detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal performance but are costly to deploy, and post-training quantization often causes significant accuracy loss. Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly elevated the visual fidelity of Virtual Try-On (VTON) systems, yet reliable evaluation remains a persistent bottleneck. Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts. Experimental results show strong agreement with human judgments (Kendall's $\tau$ of 0.833 vs. 0.611 for SSIM), establishing a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a pivotal task in autonomous driving, providing a dense and fine-grained understanding of the surrounding environment, yet single-modality methods face trade-offs between camera semantics and LiDAR geometry. Existing multi-modal frameworks often struggle with modality heterogeneity, spatial misalignment, and the representation crisis--where voxels are computationally heavy and BEV alternatives are lossy. We present GaussianOcc3D, a multi-modal framework bridging camera and LiDAR through a memory-efficient, continuous 3D Gaussian representation. We introduce four modules: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), using depth-wise deformable sampling to lift sparse signals onto Gaussian primitives; (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing (EBFS) to mitigate domain noise; (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion (ACLF) with uncertainty-aware reweighting for sensor reliability; and (4) a Gauss-Mamba Head leveraging Selective State Space Models for global context with linear complexity. Evaluations on Occ3D, SurroundOcc, and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mIoU scores of 49.4%, 28.9%, and 25.2% respectively. GaussianOcc3D exhibits superior robustness across challenging rainy and nighttime conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22730v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Compressing long chains of thought (CoT) into compact latent tokens is crucial for efficient reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22737v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust safety of vision-language large models (VLLMs) under joint multilingual and multimodal inputs remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Live streaming platforms require real-time monitoring and reaction to social signals, utilizing partial and asynchronous evidence from video, text, and audio. We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22744v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based face swapping achieves state-of-the-art performance, yet it also exacerbates the potential harm of malicious face swapping to violate portraiture right or undermine personal reputation. This has spurred the development of proactive defense methods. However, existing approaches face a core trade-off: large perturbations distort facial structures, while small ones weaken protection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility. A two-phase alternating optimization strategy is designed to generate final perturbed face images. Extensive experiments show that FaceDefense significantly outperforms existing methods in both imperceptibility and defense effectiveness, achieving a superior trade-off.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industrial troubleshooting guides encode diagnostic procedures in flowchart-like diagrams where spatial layout and technical language jointly convey meaning. To integrate this knowledge into operator support systems, which assist shop-floor personnel in diagnosing and resolving equipment issues, the information must first be extracted and structured for machine interpretation. However, when performed manually, this extraction is labor-intensive and error-prone. Vision Language Models offer potential to automate this process by jointly interpreting visual and textual meaning, yet their performance on such guides remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two VLMs on extracting structured knowledge, comparing two prompting strategies: standard instruction-guided versus an augmented approach that cues troubleshooting layout patterns. Results reveal model-specific trade-offs between layout sensitivity and semantic robustness, informing practical deployment decisions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) methods rely on training encoder-decoder models to reconstruct anomaly-free features. We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22778v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As realistic AI-generated images threaten digital authenticity, we address the generalization failure of generative artifact-based detectors by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the camera imaging pipeline. Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction). A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images. By leveraging these distinct features to construct a binary classifier, DCCT achieves state-of-the-art generalization and robustness, significantly outperforming prior methods across over 20 unseen generators.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in image-based satellite 3D reconstruction have progressed along two complementary directions. On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22809v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing methods for farmland remote sensing image (FRSI) segmentation generally follow a static segmentation paradigm, where analysis relies solely on the limited information contained within a single input patch. Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22830v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable environmental perception remains one of the main obstacles for safe operation of automated vehicles. Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: VQ-based image generation typically follows a two-stage pipeline: a tokenizer encodes images into discrete tokens, and a generative model learns their dependencies for reconstruction. However, improved tokenization in the first stage does not necessarily enhance the second-stage generation, as existing methods fail to constrain token dependencies. This mismatch forces the generative model to learn from unordered distributions, leading to bias and weak coherence. To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features. We further design a Hierarchical Native Training strategy that updates only new expert blocks, ensuring training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NativeTok.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work aims to address a novel Customized Virtual Try-ON (Cu-VTON) task, enabling the superimposition of a specified garment onto a model that can be customized in terms of appearance, posture, and additional attributes. Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes. Extensive experiments on the open available benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NCT framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS. Upon acceptance, we will publish all code.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22853v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet its practical deployment is often hindered by incomplete multimodal data. Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.   We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.   To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22904v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies have explored using pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) such as DINO for generative autoencoders, showing strong generative performance. Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22917v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The estimation of abundance and density in unmarked populations of great apes relies on statistical frameworks that require animal-to-camera distance measurements. In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation. The proposed approach yields population estimates within 22% of those obtained using traditional methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) predicts perceptual quality scores consistent with human judgments. Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets. The code and models will be made available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22929v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image embeddings are generally assumed to pose limited privacy risk. We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22959v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant computational challenges in video processing due to massive data redundancy, which creates prohibitively long token sequences. To address this, we introduce Triage, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that reframes video reasoning as a resource allocation problem via hierarchical visual budgeting. Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Triage improves inference speed and reduces memory footprint, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of baselines and other methods on various video reasoning benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22961v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Supervised machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in optical quality control within industrial production. These approaches require representative datasets for effective model training. However, while non-defective components are frequent, defective parts are rare in production, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets that adversely impact model performance. Existing strategies to address this challenge, such as specialized loss functions or traditional data augmentation techniques, have limitations, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning or the alteration of only simple image features. Therefore, this work explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an alternative method for expanding limited datasets and enhancing supervised machine learning performance. Specifically, we investigate Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN as image generation models, focusing on the segmentation of combine harvester components in thermal images for subsequent defect detection. Our results demonstrate that dataset expansion using Stable Diffusion yields the most significant improvement, enhancing segmentation performance by 4.6 %, resulting in a Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) of 84.6 %.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22982v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22990v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing 3D fetal MR volumes from motion-corrupted stacks of 2D slices is a crucial and challenging task. Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction. Code will be available upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance in microscopy imaging, yet their confidence estimates often lack calibration, limiting their reliability for biomedical applications. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve model calibration by leveraging multi-rater annotations. We propose to train separate models on the annotations from single experts and aggregate their predictions to emulate consensus. This improves upon label sampling strategies, where models are trained on mixed annotations, and offers a more principled way to capture inter-rater variability. Experiments on a colorectal organoid dataset annotated by two experts demonstrate that our rater-specific ensemble strategy improves calibration performance while maintaining comparable detection accuracy. These findings suggest that explicitly modelling rater disagreement can lead to more trustworthy object detectors in biomedical imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but still suffer from hallucination and safety-related failures that persist even at scale. Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{OSGA} (\textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{S}teering with \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that a single OSGA-optimized steering vector consistently improves hallucination mitigation and safety enhancement with negligible overhead, highlighting one-shot steering as a practical and scalable solution for reliable VLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual geolocalization, the task of predicting where an image was taken, remains challenging due to global scale, visual ambiguity, and the inherently hierarchical structure of geography. Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%. These results demonstrate that geometry-aware hierarchical embeddings provide a scalable and conceptually new alternative for global image geolocation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23102v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transferable adversarial attacks on point clouds remain challenging, as existing methods often rely on model-specific gradients or heuristics that limit generalization to unseen architectures. In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a compact subspace perspective and propose CoSA, a transferable attack framework that operates within a shared low-dimensional semantic space. Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that CoSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transferable attacks, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility and robustness under common defense strategies. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate sensor-to-vehicle calibration is essential for safe autonomous driving. Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23159v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scene understanding with free-form language has been widely explored within diverse modalities such as images, point clouds, and LiDAR. However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video relighting offers immense creative potential and commercial value but is hindered by challenges, including the absence of an adequate evaluation metric, severe light flickering, and the degradation of fine-grained details during editing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hi-Light, a novel, training-free framework for high-fidelity, high-resolution, robust video relighting. Our approach introduces three technical innovations: lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion that stabilises intermediate relit video, a Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter that leverages optical flow to ensure temporal stability without introducing motion blur, and a LAB-based Detail Fusion module that preserves high-frequency detail information from the original video. Furthermore, to address the critical gap in evaluation, we propose the Light Stability Score, the first quantitative metric designed to specifically measure lighting consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Light significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, producing stable, highly detailed relit videos.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)' linguistic prowess in medical diagnosis, we find even state-of-the-art MLLMs suffer from a critical perceptual deficit: geometric blindness. This failure to ground outputs in objective geometric constraints leads to plausible yet factually incorrect hallucinations, rooted in training paradigms that prioritize linguistic fluency over geometric fidelity. This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that "cures" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark. Furthermore, this enhanced geometric perception generalizes to broader medical understanding, achieving superior results on radiological and comprehensive medical VQA tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While dense pixel-wise annotations remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation, they are costly to obtain and limit scalability. In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models for long-video understanding predominantly rely on uniform sampling and single-turn inference, limiting their ability to identify sparse yet critical evidence amid extensive redundancy. We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23232v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.

We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models suffer performance degradation under domain shift, limiting real-world applicability. Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23281v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-set object detection (OSOD) localizes objects while identifying and rejecting unknown classes at inference. While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22161v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9\% to \textbf{65.56\%} (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved \textbf{67.62\%} (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached \textbf{75.30\%}, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5\%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved \textbf{72.68\%} (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22195v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing attention as a potential solution to address the challenges of computation requirements in the future. Earth observation (EO) has entered the era of Big Data, and the computational demands for effectively analyzing large EO data with complex deep learning models have become a bottleneck. Motivated by this, we aim to leverage quantum computing for EO data classification and explore its advantages despite the current limitations of quantum devices. This paper presents a hybrid model that incorporates multitask learning to assist efficient data encoding and employs a location weight module with quantum convolution operations to extract valid features for classification. The validity of our proposed model was evaluated using multiple EO benchmarks. Additionally, we experimentally explored the generalizability of our model and investigated the factors contributing to its advantage, highlighting the potential of QML in EO data analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22197v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating clinical reports that summarize abnormal patterns, diagnostic findings, and clinical interpretations from long-term EEG recordings remains labor-intensive. We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\%$--$95\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$. In the zero-shot setting without patient history, CELM attains generation scores in the range of $0.43$--$0.52$, compared to baselines of $0.17$--$0.26$. CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to enable scalable multimodal learning. We release our model and benchmark construction pipeline at [URL].

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters substantial challenges due to heterogeneity, leading to gradient noise, client drift, and partial client participation errors, the last of which is the most pervasive but remains insufficiently addressed in current literature. In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) when part of the decision-relevant state is observed only through noisy measurements and the distribution may change between training and deployment. Such settings induce spurious state-action correlations, so standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- whether conditioning on raw measurements or ignoring them -- can converge to systematically biased policies under distribution shift. We propose a general framework for IL under measurement error, inspired by explicitly modeling the causal relationships among the variables, yielding a target that retains a causal interpretation and is robust to distribution shift. Building on ideas from proximal causal inference, we introduce \texttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy state observations as proxy variables, and we provide identification conditions under which the target policy is recoverable from demonstrations without rewards or interactive expert queries. We develop estimators for both discrete and continuous state spaces; for continuous settings, we use an adversarial procedure over RKHS function classes to learn the required parameters. We evaluate \texttt{CausIL} on semi-simulated longitudinal data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 cohort and demonstrate improved robustness to distribution shift compared to BC baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22211v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with combinatorial action spaces remains challenging because feasible action sets are exponentially large and governed by complex feasibility constraints, making direct policy parameterization impractical. Existing approaches embed task-specific value functions into constrained optimization programs or learn deterministic structured policies, sacrificing generality and policy expressiveness. We propose a solver-induced \emph{latent spherical flow policy} that brings the expressiveness of modern generative policies to combinatorial RL while guaranteeing feasibility by design. Our method, LSFlow, learns a \emph{stochastic} policy in a compact continuous latent space via spherical flow matching, and delegates feasibility to a combinatorial optimization solver that maps each latent sample to a valid structured action. To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization. To address the piecewise-constant and discontinuous value landscape induced by solver-based action selection, we introduce a smoothed Bellman operator that yields stable, well-defined learning targets. Empirically, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 20.6\% across a range of challenging combinatorial RL tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22230v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time scaling for code generation commonly relies on Best-of-N selection, in which multiple candidate solutions are sampled from a base model, and the best one is selected by an LLM judge. However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. Empirically, DAJ achieves state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, outperforming strong test-time scaling baselines as well as leading proprietary models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Code generation is a core application of large language models (LLMs), yet LLMs still frequently fail on complex programming tasks. Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini. Furthermore, FunPRM produces code that is more readable and reusable for developers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22257v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The attention mechanism in its standard implementation contains extraneous rotational degrees of freedom that are carried through computation but do not affect model activations or outputs. We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads. Overall, our results show that minimal, principled architectural changes can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22259v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22265v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Limited access to medical infrastructure forces elderly and vulnerable patients to rely on home-based care, often leading to neglect and poor adherence to therapeutic exercises such as yoga or physiotherapy. To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22274v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world federated systems seldom operate on static data: input distributions drift while privacy rules forbid raw-data sharing. We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of SPECIAL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models are increasingly used in real-world creative workflows, a principled framework for valuing contributors who provide a collection of data is essential for fair compensation and sustainable data marketplaces. While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that SurrogateSHAP effectively localizes data sources responsible for spurious correlations in clinical images, providing a scalable path toward auditing safety-critical generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model merging combines knowledge from separately fine-tuned models, yet success factors remain poorly understood. While recent work treats mergeability as an intrinsic property, we show with an architecture-agnostic framework that it fundamentally depends on both the merging method and the partner tasks. Using linear optimization over a set of interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance), we uncover properties correlating with post-merge performance across four merging methods. We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific "fingerprints". Crucially, however, subspace overlap and gradient alignment metrics consistently emerge as foundational, method-agnostic prerequisites for compatibility. These findings provide a diagnostic foundation for understanding mergeability and motivate future fine-tuning strategies that explicitly encourage these properties.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conditional generative models map input variables to complex, high-dimensional distributions, enabling realistic sample generation in a diverse set of domains. A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, yet both centralized and decentralized approaches face challenges in scalability, security, and update validation. We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22305v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic workflow generation is the process of automatically synthesizing sequences of LLM calls, tool invocations, and post-processing steps for complex end-to-end tasks. Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior. We instantiate BWG as \textbf{BayesFlow}, a training-free algorithm for workflow construction. Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design. Code will be available on https://github.com/BoYuanVisionary/BayesFlow.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of propagating the mean and covariance of a general multivariate Gaussian distribution through a deep (residual) neural network using layer-by-layer moment matching. We close a longstanding gap by deriving exact moment matching for the probit, GeLU, ReLU (as a limit of GeLU), Heaviside (as a limit of probit), and sine activation functions; for both feedforward and generalized residual layers. On random networks, we find orders-of-magnitude improvements in the KL divergence error metric, up to a millionfold, over popular alternatives. On real data, we find competitive statistical calibration for inference under epistemic uncertainty in the input. On a variational Bayes network, we show that our method attains hundredfold improvements in KL divergence from Monte Carlo ground truth over a state-of-the-art deterministic inference method. We also give an a priori error bound and a preliminary analysis of stochastic feedforward neurons, which have recently attracted general interest.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22308v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Regression models are widely used in industrial processes, engineering and in natural and physical sciences, yet their robustness to poisoning has received less attention. When it has, studies often assume unrealistic threat models and are thus less useful in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal stealthy attack formulation that considers different degrees of detectability and show that it bypasses state-of-the-art defenses. We further propose a new methodology based on normalization of objectives to evaluate different trade-offs between effectiveness and detectability. Finally, we develop a novel defense (BayesClean) against stealthy attacks. BayesClean improves on previous defenses when attacks are stealthy and the number of poisoning points is significant.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone. Supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/SCALAR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely static and are frequently updated in practice. A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed "aligned" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems involve an expensive ground-truth oracle (e.g., human evaluation, physical experiments) and a cheap, low-fidelity prediction oracle (e.g., machine learning models, simulations). Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22317v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recovering missing flows on the edges of a network, while exactly respecting local conservation laws, is a fundamental inverse problem that arises in many systems such as transportation, energy, and mobility. We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization. Across three real-world flow benchmarks (traffic, power, bike), FlowSymm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE and correlation metrics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly accessed as remotely hosted services by edge and enterprise clients that cannot run frontier models locally. Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22320v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study continual mean estimation, where data vectors arrive sequentially and the goal is to maintain accurate estimates of the running mean. We address this problem under user-level differential privacy, which protects each user's entire dataset even when they contribute multiple data points. Previous work on this problem has focused on pure differential privacy. While important, this approach limits applicability, as it leads to overly noisy estimates. In contrast, we analyze the problem under approximate differential privacy, adopting recent advances in the Matrix Factorization mechanism. We introduce a novel mean estimation specific factorization, which is both efficient and accurate, achieving asymptotically lower mean-squared error bounds in continual mean estimation under user-level differential privacy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical enabler for a wide range of location-based services in smart environments, including navigation, asset tracking, and safety-critical applications. Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22323v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model routing chooses which language model to use for each query. By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22324v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern clinical practice relies on evidence-based guidelines implemented as compact scoring systems composed of a small number of interpretable decision rules. While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22326v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monitoring the performance of classification models in production is critical yet challenging due to strict labeling budgets, one-shot batch acquisition of labels and extremely low error rates. We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecular representations fundamentally shape how machine learning systems reason about molecular structure and physical properties. Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction. Our results show that treating molecules as continuous functions fundamentally changes how molecular representations generalize across tasks and yields downstream behavior that is stable to how molecules are discretized or queried.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recovering governing equations from data is central to scientific discovery, yet existing methods often break down under noisy, partial observations, or rely on black-box latent dynamics that obscure mechanism. We introduce MAAT (Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories), a framework for symbolic discovery built on knowledge-informed Kernel State Reconstruction. MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cell Painting is a microscopy-based, high-content imaging assay that produces rich morphological profiles of cells and can support drug discovery by quantifying cellular responses to chemical perturbations. At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the gold standard for training machine learning models with formal differential privacy guarantees. Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD. We show that the computational overhead is minimal and empirically demonstrate improved accuracy over DP-SGD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The knowledge gradient is a popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization (BO) for optimizing black-box objectives with noisy function evaluations. Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions. In addition, we also present a case study illustrating the limitation of the knowledge gradient in certain scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern supply chains must balance high-speed logistics with environmental impact and security constraints, prompting a surge of interest in AI-enabled Internet of Things (AIoT) solutions for global commerce. However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs.

We introduce three parametric tasks with controllable exploration difficulty, spanning continuous and discrete environments. Across state-of-the-art models, we find systematic under-exploration and suboptimal solutions, with performance often significantly worse than simple explore--exploit heuristic baselines and scaling weakly as the budget increases. Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have adopted block rotations to diffuse outliers prior to rounding. While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22350v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a Markov decision process (MDP), we seek to learn representations for a range of policies to facilitate behavior steering at test time. As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.

To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22355v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of quantifying how far an empirical distribution deviates from Gaussianity under the framework of optimal transport. By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \emph{not} be the \(W_2\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safe learning is essential for deploying learningbased controllers in safety-critical robotic systems, yet existing approaches often enforce multiple safety constraints uniformly or via fixed priority orders, leading to infeasibility and brittle behavior. In practice, safety requirements are heterogeneous and admit only partial priority relations, where some constraints are comparable while others are inherently incomparable. We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction. Experiments on multi-obstacle navigation, constrained robot manipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving demonstrate improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability over unstructured and differentiable quadratic program-based safety layers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Being polite is free - or is it? In this paper, we quantify the energy cost of seemingly innocuous messages such as ``thank you'' when interacting with large language models, often used by users to convey politeness. Using real-world conversation traces and fine-grained energy measurements, we quantify how input length, output length and model size affect energy use. While politeness is our motivating example, it also serves as a controlled and reproducible proxy for measuring the energy footprint of a typical LLM interaction. Our findings provide actionable insights for building more sustainable and efficient LLM applications, especially in increasingly widespread real-world contexts like chat. As user adoption grows and billions of prompts are processed daily, understanding and mitigating this cost becomes crucial - not just for efficiency, but for sustainable AI deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a practical alternative to avoid full model re-training by approximately removing the influence of specific user data. While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22362v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in production, contributing towards shifting the burden in terms of computational resources and energy demands from training to inference. While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack. Our findings motivate phase-aware energy profiling and system-level optimizations for greener AI services.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22371v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-fidelity (MF) regression often operates in regimes of extreme data imbalance, where the commonly-used Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates struggle with cubic scaling costs and overfit to sparse high-fidelity observations, limiting efficiency and generalization in real-world applications. We introduce FIRE, a training-free MF framework that couples tabular foundation models (TFMs) to perform zero-shot in-context Bayesian inference via a high-fidelity correction model conditioned on the low-fidelity model's posterior predictive distributions. This cross-fidelity information transfer via distributional summaries captures heteroscedastic errors, enabling robust residual learning without model retraining. Across 31 benchmark problems spanning synthetic and real-world tasks (e.g., DrivAerNet, LCBench), FIRE delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than seven state-of-the-art GP-based or deep learning MF regression methods, ranking highest in accuracy and uncertainty quantification with runtime advantages. Limitations include context window constraints and dependence on the quality of the pre-trained TFM's.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22382v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many key challenges in biological design-such as small-molecule drug discovery, antimicrobial peptide development, and protein engineering-can be framed as black-box optimization over vast, complex structured spaces. Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphs provide a natural representation of relational structure that arises across diverse domains. Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-stage ML inference pipelines are difficult to autoscale due to heterogeneous resources, cross-stage coupling, and dynamic bottleneck migration. We present SAIR, an autoscaling framework that uses an LLM as an in-context reinforcement learning controller, improving its policy online from reward-labeled interaction histories without gradient updates. SAIR combines Pareto-dominance reward shaping with a provable separation margin, surprisal-guided experience retrieval for context efficiency, and fine-grained GPU rate control via user-space CUDA interception. We provide regret analysis decomposing error into retrieval coverage and LLM selection components. On four ML serving pipelines under three workload patterns, SAIR achieves the best or tied-best P99 latency and effective resource cost among deployed baselines, improving P99 by up to 50% and reducing effective cost by up to 97% (under GPU rate-control assumptions), with 86% bottleneck detection accuracy and no offline training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying the root causes of outliers is a fundamental problem in causal inference and anomaly detection. Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22409v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(n\epsilon)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22416v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal-attributed graphs (MMAGs) provide a unified framework for modeling complex relational data by integrating heterogeneous modalities with graph structures. While centralized learning has shown promising performance, MMAGs in real-world applications are often distributed across isolated platforms and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns or commercial constraints. Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL). To bridge this gap, we present MM-OpenFGL, the first comprehensive benchmark that systematically formalizes the MMFGL paradigm and enables rigorous evaluation. MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API. Extensive experiments investigate MMFGL from the perspectives of necessity, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, offering valuable insights for future research on MMFGL.

However, creating leaderboards traditionally demands significant manual effort. In recent years, efforts have been made to automate leaderboard generation, but existing datasets for this purpose are limited by capturing only the best results from each paper and limited metadata. We present MetaLead, a fully human-annotated ML Leaderboard dataset that captures all experimental results for result transparency and contains extra metadata, such as the result experimental type: baseline, proposed method, or variation of proposed method for experiment-type guided comparisons, and explicitly separates train and test dataset for cross-domain assessment. This enriched structure makes MetaLead a powerful resource for more transparent and nuanced evaluations across ML research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22427v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid growth and continuous structural evolution of dynamic networks make effective predictions increasingly challenging. To enable prediction models to adapt to complex temporal environments, they need to be robust to emerging structural changes. We propose a dynamic network learning framework CoDCL, which combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to address this deficiency.Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive strategy to generate high-quality counterfactual data, combining a dynamic treatments design with efficient structural neighborhood exploration to quantify the temporal changes in interaction patterns.Crucially, the entire CoDCL is designed as a plug-and-play universal module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing temporal graph models without requiring architectural modifications.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CoDCL significantly gains state-of-the-art baseline models in the field of dynamic networks, confirming the critical role of integrating counterfactual data augmentation into dynamic representation learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22432v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: GRPO is a standard approach to endowing pretrained LLMs with reasoning capabilities. It estimates the advantage of an outcome from a group of $K$ outcomes, and promotes those with positive advantages inside a trust region. Since GRPO discriminates between good and bad outcomes softly, it benefits from additional refinements such as asymmetric clipping and zero-variance data filtering. While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes. Our approach can be viewed as an online instantiation of (multi-label) noise contrastive estimation for LLM reasoning. We validate our method by demonstrating competitive performance on a suite of challenging math benchmarks against strong baselines such as DAPO and online DPO.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22442v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data and pipeline parallelism are key strategies for scaling neural network training across distributed devices, but their high communication cost necessitates co-located computing clusters with fast interconnects, limiting their scalability. We address this communication bottleneck by introducing asynchronous updates across both parallelism axes, relaxing the co-location requirement at the expense of introducing staleness between pipeline stages and data parallel replicas. To mitigate staleness, for pipeline parallelism, we adopt a weight look-ahead approach, and for data parallelism, we introduce an asynchronous sparse averaging method equipped with an exponential moving average based correction mechanism. We provide convergence guarantees for both sparse averaging and asynchronous updates. Experiments on large-scale language models (up to \em 1B parameters) demonstrate that our approach matches the performance of the fully synchronous baseline, while significantly reducing communication overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can a diffusion model trained on bedrooms recover human faces? Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forecasting future events is highly valuable in decision-making and is a robust measure of general intelligence. As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22447v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for decomposing language model representations into interpretable features. Current interpretation methods infer feature semantics from activation patterns, but overlook that features are trained to reconstruct activations that serve computational roles in the forward pass. We introduce a novel weight-based interpretation framework that measures functional effects through direct weight interactions, requiring no activation data. Through three experiments on Gemma-2 and Llama-3.1 models, we demonstrate that (1) 1/4 of features directly predict output tokens, (2) features actively participate in attention mechanisms with depth-dependent structure, and (3) semantic and non-semantic feature populations exhibit distinct distribution profiles in attention circuits. Our analysis provides the missing out-of-context half of SAE feature interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: RLVR is now a standard way to train LLMs on reasoning tasks with verifiable outcomes, but when rollout generation dominates the cost, efficiency depends heavily on which prompts you sample and when. In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22450v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models have recently emerged as a powerful generative paradigm, yet their generalization properties remain understudied compared to their auto-regressive counterparts. In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\%$ and $5.8\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes.

However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims at removing the influence of specific data from a pretrained model while preserving performance on the remaining data. In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22466v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) aims to discover bioactive ligands. Conventional approaches construct probability paths separately in Euclidean and probabilistic spaces for continuous atomic coordinates and discrete chemical categories, leading to a mismatch with the underlying statistical manifolds. We address this issue from an information-geometric perspective by modeling molecules as composite exponential-family distributions and defining generative flows along exponential geodesics under the Fisher-Rao metric. To avoid the instantaneous trajectory collapse induced by geodesics directly targeting Dirac distributions, we propose Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for SBDD (EvoEGF-Mol), which replaces static Dirac targets with dynamically concentrating distributions, ensuring stable training via a progressive-parameter-refinement architecture. Our model approaches a reference-level PoseBusters passing rate (93.4%) on CrossDock, demonstrating remarkable geometric precision and interaction fidelity, while outperforming baselines on real-world MolGenBench tasks by recovering bioactive scaffolds and generating candidates that meet established MedChem filters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent learning, classically theorized by Tolman, shows that biological agents (e.g., rats) can acquire internal representations of their environment without rewards, enabling rapid adaptation once rewards are introduced. In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to develop lifelong learning agents to continuously acquire knowledge across diverse tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models trained via next-token prediction are fundamentally pattern-matchers: sensitive to superficial phrasing variations even when the underlying problem is identical. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22484v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance by scaling test-time compute, they frequently suffer from Cognitive Inertia, a failure pattern manifesting as either overthinking (inertia of motion) or reasoning rigidity (inertia of direction). Existing detection methods, typically relying on superficial textual heuristics like self-correction tokens, often fail to capture the model's unvoiced internal conflicts. To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks confirm that STARS efficiently curtails redundant loops while improving accuracy through the adaptive correction of erroneous trajectories. STARS offers a robust, unsupervised mechanism to optimize the reasoning process of LRMs without requiring additional fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models are typically trained at a fixed computational capacity, while real-world applications require deployment across platforms with different resource constraints. Current approaches usually rely on training families of model variants or model distillation, which requires additional training and supports only a pre-selected set of sizes rather than fine-grained adaptation at runtime. In this paper, we propose Elastic Spectral State Space Models (ES-SSM), which require only one-time training at full capacity, but can be directly truncated into arbitrary scales for budgeted, runtime inference without retraining. Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement. We test our algorithm across long-sequence benchmarks spanning text, logic, retrieval, vision, and audio. We demonstrate that a single ES-SSM model trained once can be truncated to provide competitive performance compared with modern Transformer and SSM baselines at similar parameter scales. Furthermore, by testing under various runtime budgets, we observe smooth and stable budget-performance curves over a wide range of truncation levels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22495v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22496v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hierarchical policies in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) addresses long-horizon tasks by decomposing control into high-level subgoal planning and low-level action execution. A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22509v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing neural solvers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are typically trained either in a one-off manner on a fixed set of pre-defined tasks or in a lifelong manner on several tasks arriving sequentially, assuming sufficient training on each task. Both settings overlook a common real-world property: problem patterns may drift continually over time, yielding massive tasks sequentially arising while offering only limited training resources per task. In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22510v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit unexpected errors or unintended behavior, even at scale. While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and visible light communication (VLC) technologies has emerged as a promising solution to offer flexible communication and efficient lighting. This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22516v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder influenced by genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph generation aims to sample discrete node and edge attributes while satisfying coupled structural constraints. Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency. On synthetic and molecular graph datasets, VBFN improves fidelity and diversity, and surpasses baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Because of the pervasive use of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in high-stakes domains, the interpretability of DNNs has received increased attention. The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \textbf{REKD} (\textbf{R}ationale \textbf{E}xtraction with \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The reinforcement fine-tuning area is undergoing an explosion papers largely on optimizing design choices. Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22538v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study Learning to Defer for non-stationary time series with partial feedback and time-varying expert availability. At each time step, the router selects an available expert, observes the target, and sees only the queried expert's prediction. We model signed expert residuals using L2D-SLDS, a factorized switching linear-Gaussian state-space model with context-dependent regime transitions, a shared global factor enabling cross-expert information transfer, and per-expert idiosyncratic states. The model supports expert entry and pruning via a dynamic registry. Using one-step-ahead predictive beliefs, we propose an IDS-inspired routing rule that trades off predicted cost against information gained about the latent regime and shared factor. Experiments show improvements over contextual-bandit baselines and a no-shared-factor ablation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22539v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans learn efficiently from their environment by engaging multiple interacting neural systems that support distinct yet complementary forms of control, including model-based (goal-directed) planning, model-free (habitual) responding, and episodic memory-based learning. Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has been proposed as an efficient alternative for the numerical approximation of PDE solutions, offering fast, iterative simulation of PDEs through the approximation of solution operators. However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models. Our results demonstrate consistent improvement in the long-term stability of auto-regressive neural operator models, regardless of the model architecture. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of neural operators from the spectral domain, highlighting significant limitations of present architectures. These results highlight the need for future work to consider architectures that place specific emphasis on high frequency components, which are integral to the understanding and modeling of turbulent flows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22563v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22578v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving traffic prediction, yet its performance is often challenged by the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) nature of decentralized traffic data. Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22579v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group-relative policy optimization methods train language models by generating multiple rollouts per prompt and normalizing rewards with a shared mean reward baseline. In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22589v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing raw data, but privacy regulations such as the right to be forgotten require FL systems to remove the influence of previously used training data upon request. Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22593v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-graph learning is crucial for extracting meaningful signals from collections of heterogeneous graphs. However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries. Our work establishes MGMT as a unified framework for structured multi-graph learning, advancing representation techniques in domains where graph-based data plays a central role.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to erase designated client-level, class-level, or sample-level knowledge from a global model. Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22610v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction requires integrating complementary information from molecular structure and chemical semantics. In this work, we propose LGM-CL, a local-global multimodal contrastive learning framework that jointly models molecular graphs and textual representations derived from SMILES and chemistry-aware augmented texts. Local functional group information and global molecular topology are captured using AttentiveFP and Graph Transformer encoders, respectively, and aligned through self-supervised contrastive learning. In addition, chemically enriched textual descriptions are contrasted with original SMILES to incorporate physicochemical semantics in a task-agnostic manner. During fine-tuning, molecular fingerprints are further integrated via Dual Cross-attention multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that LGM-CL achieves consistent and competitive performance across both classification and regression tasks, validating the effectiveness of unified local-global and multimodal representation learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22614v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard attention-based transformers are known to exhibit instability under learning rate overspecification during training, particularly at high learning rates. While various methods have been proposed to improve resilience to such overspecification by modifying the optimization procedure, fundamental architectural innovations to this end remain underexplored. In this work, we illustrate that the consensus mechanism, a drop-in replacement for attention, stabilizes transformer training across a wider effective range of learning rates. We formulate consensus as a graphical model and provide extensive empirical analysis demonstrating improved stability across learning rate sweeps on text, DNA, and protein modalities. We further propose a hybrid consensus-attention framework that preserves performance while improving stability. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing the properties of consensus.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22628v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving. Our code and implementation details are available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/TTCS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22631v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The application of data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has long been constrained by the availability of large amount of degradation data. Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\% of samples of target equipment are used. Meanwhile, it substantially outperforms conventional supervised and few-shot approaches while markedly reducing the data required to achieve high predictive accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22642v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, yet their stochastic next-token prediction creates logical inconsistencies and reward hacking that formal symbolic systems avoid. To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal logic verification-guided framework that dynamically interleaves formal symbolic verification with the natural language generation process, providing real-time feedback to detect and rectify errors as they occur. Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively. These results validate that formal verification can serve as a scalable mechanism to significantly push the performance boundaries of advanced LLM reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22651v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training-data attribution for vision generative models aims to identify which training data influenced a given output. While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22660v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate progressive freezing as an alternative to straight-through estimators (STE) for training binary networks from scratch. Under controlled training conditions, we find that while global progressive freezing works for binary-weight networks, it fails for full binary neural networks due to activation-induced gradient blockades. We introduce StoMPP (Stochastic Masked Partial Progressive Binarization), which uses layerwise stochastic masking to progressively replace differentiable clipped weights/activations with hard binary step functions, while only backpropagating through the unfrozen (clipped) subset (i.e., no straight-through estimator). Under a matched minimal training recipe, StoMPP improves accuracy over a BinaryConnect-style STE baseline, with gains that increase with depth (e.g., for ResNet-50 BNN: +18.0 on CIFAR-10, +13.5 on CIFAR-100, and +3.8 on ImageNet; for ResNet-18: +3.1, +4.7, and +1.3). For binary-weight networks, StoMPP achieves 91.2\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 69.5\% on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50. We analyze training dynamics under progressive freezing, revealing non-monotonic convergence and improved depth scaling under binarization constraints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22669v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates decentralized collaborative learning without transmitting raw data. However, reliance on fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning hinders practical deployment by incurring high computational costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose a data-free early stopping framework that determines the optimal stopping point by monitoring the task vector's growth rate using solely server-side parameters. The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods. In particular, the proposed framework spends an average of 47/20 (skin lesion/blood cell) rounds to achieve over 12.5%/10.3% higher performance than early stopping based on validation data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an early stopping framework for FL methods without using any validation data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Full-graph and mini-batch Graph Neural Network (GNN) training approaches have distinct system design demands, making it crucial to choose the appropriate approach to develop. A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Consistency models have been proposed for fast generative modeling, achieving results competitive with diffusion and flow models. However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22690v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks. However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity. We release the source code to support future research.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases. We demonstrate the impact of our approach exemplarily on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset. This is a first step to enable fit-for-purpose evaluation of training and test data in practice as the base for establishing trustworthy AI in medicine.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22707v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis. The implementation, dataset generation scripts, and the interactive inference application are publicly available at: https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22708v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a fundamental parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances efficiency and performance in large-scale neural networks. However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22711v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) have rapidly gained traction as an important component in the pre-training pipelines of leading Vision-Language-Action models. However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22716v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By "breaking the blocks" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has found that neural networks with stronger generalization tend to exhibit higher representational alignment with one another across architectures and training paradigms. In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling. Together, our results identify local intrinsic dimension as a unifying descriptor of representational convergence in artificial and biological systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22736v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Causal inference from observational data provides strong evidence for the best action in decision-making without performing expensive randomized trials. The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22745v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance. Together, these results establish a principled foundation and offer practical guidance for loss selections in large-class machine learning applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Physical systems near singularities, interfaces, and critical points exhibit power-law scaling, yet standard neural networks leave the governing exponents implicit. We introduce physics-informed M"untz-Sz'asz Networks (MSN-PINN), a power-law basis network that treats scaling exponents as trainable parameters. The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|\mu - \alpha|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error. Constraint-aware training encodes physical requirements such as boundary condition compatibility and improves accuracy by three orders of magnitude over naive training. By combining the expressiveness of neural networks with the interpretability of asymptotic analysis, MSN-PINN produces learned parameters with direct physical meaning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22752v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Obfuscated Semantic Null space Injection for Privacy (OSNIP), a lightweight client-side encryption framework for privacy-preserving LLM inference. Generalizing the geometric intuition of linear kernels to the high-dimensional latent space of LLMs, we formally define the ``Obfuscated Semantic Null Space'', a high-dimensional regime that preserves semantic fidelity while enforcing near-orthogonality to the original embedding. By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing. Furthermore, OSNIP employs a key-dependent stochastic mapping that synthesizes individualized perturbation trajectories unique to each user. Evaluations on 12 generative and classification benchmarks show that OSNIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, sharply reducing attack success rates while maintaining strong model utility under strict security constraints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22756v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks often generalize well despite heavy over-parameterization, challenging classical parameter-based analyses. We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity. At the final embedding layer, architectural sensitivity vanishes and the bound is dominated by embedding dimension, explaining its strong empirical correlation with generalization performance. Experiments across architectures and datasets validate the theory and demonstrate the utility of embedding-based diagnostics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22757v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecular generative models, often employing GPT-style language modeling on molecular string representations, have shown promising capabilities when scaled to large datasets and model sizes. However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation. Additionally, we publicly release the largest library of molecular language models to date to facilitate future research and development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\alpha$-entmax attention with $\alpha = 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \to \infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22787v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training compression is currently divided into two contrasting regimes. On the one hand, fast, data-free, and model-agnostic methods (e.g., NF4 or HQQ) offer maximum accessibility but suffer from functional collapse at extreme bit-rates below 4 bits. On the other hand, techniques leveraging calibration data or extensive recovery training achieve superior fidelity but impose high computational constraints and face uncertain robustness under data distribution shifts. We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate that EntQuant does not only achieve state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation sets and models, but also retains functional performance on more complex benchmarks with instruction-tuned models, all at modest inference overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22801v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22805v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hierarchical sequence models replace fixed tokenization with learned segmentations that compress long byte sequences for efficient autoregressive modeling. While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet-II .

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22816v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have recently been adapted to tabular data containing discrete and continuous features. However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases have become indispensable in supporting clinical decision-making through data-driven treatment recommendations. However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22823v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning of style-conditioned policies using explicit style supervision via subtrajectory labeling functions. In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22828v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in vision-language models (VLMs) faces significant challenges in improving task adaptation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow-based models have proven successful for time-series generation, particularly when defined in lower-dimensional latent spaces that enable efficient sampling. However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based baselines in standard time-series generation metrics, while achieving orders-of-magnitude faster sampling. These results highlight the practical benefits of incorporating geometric inductive biases into latent generative models for time series.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22852v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since the introduction of the Transformer architecture for large language models, the softmax-based attention layer has faced increasing scrutinity due to its quadratic-time computational complexity. Attempts have been made to replace it with less complex methods, at the cost of reduced performance in most cases. We introduce Hierarchical Shift Mixing (HSM), a general framework for token mixing that distributes pairwise token interactions across Transformer layers rather than computing them densely within each layer. HSM enables linear-time complexity while remaining agnostic to the specific mixing function. We show that even simple HSM variants achieve performance close to softmax attention, and that hybrid architectures combining HSM with softmax attention can outperform a GPT-style Transformer baseline while reducing computational cost during both training and inference.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22856v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MAGs) have been widely adopted for modeling complex systems by integrating multi-modal information, such as text and images, on nodes. However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image). The source code will be available upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22876v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for energy-efficient LLM inference. However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series data are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in developing robust machine learning models. However, access to high-quality datasets is often limited due to privacy concerns, acquisition costs, and labeling challenges. Synthetic time series generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these constraints. In this work, we present a framework for generating synthetic time series by leveraging complex networks mappings. Specifically, we investigate whether time series transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) -- and then reconstructed via inverse mapping -- can produce synthetic data that preserve the statistical and structural properties of the original. We evaluate the fidelity and utility of the generated data using both simulated and real-world datasets, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods. Results indicate that our quantile graph-based methodology offers a competitive and interpretable alternative for synthetic time series generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22887v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive sequence modeling stands as the cornerstone of modern Generative AI, powering results across diverse modalities ranging from text generation to image generation. However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of "memory-dense" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22891v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A central challenge in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) is to train generalist policies capable of performing tasks not seen during training. To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or "symbols"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions. We achieve this by treating propositions as instances of parameterized predicates rather than discrete symbols, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. We propose a novel architecture that embeds and composes predicates to represent LTL specifications, and demonstrate successful zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks across challenging environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22895v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The goal of probabilistic prediction is to issue predictive distributions that are as informative as possible, subject to being calibrated. Despite substantial progress in the univariate setting, achieving multivariate calibration remains challenging. Recent work has introduced pre-rank functions, scalar projections of multivariate forecasts and observations, as flexible diagnostics for assessing specific aspects of multivariate calibration, but their use has largely been limited to post-hoc evaluation. We propose a regularization-based calibration method that enforces multivariate calibration during training of multivariate distributional regression models using pre-rank functions. We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution. Through simulation studies and experiments on 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that the proposed approach substantially improves multivariate pre-rank calibration without compromising predictive accuracy, and that the PCA pre-rank reveals dependence-structure misspecifications that are not detected by existing pre-ranks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision trees are widely used due to their interpretability and efficiency, but they struggle in regression tasks that require reliable extrapolation and well-calibrated uncertainty. Piecewise-constant leaf predictions are bounded by the training targets and often become overconfident under distribution shift. We propose a single-tree Bayesian model that extends VSPYCT by equipping each leaf with a GP predictor. Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22932v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study a sampling problem whose target distribution is $\pi \propto \exp(-f-r)$ where the data fidelity term $f$ is Lipschitz smooth while the regularizer term $r=r_1-r_2$ is a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC) function, i.e., $r_1,r_2$ are convex. By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $\pi$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \in \mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative. Our results improve previous work on non-log-concave sampling in terms of a more general framework and assumptions. Numerical experiments show that DC-LA produces accurate distributions in synthetic settings and reliably provides uncertainty quantification in a real-world Computed Tomography application.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph coarsening reduces the size of a graph while preserving certain properties. Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22944v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging when models simultaneously encounter correlation shifts across environments and diversity shifts driven by rare or hard samples. Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Perplexity -- a function measuring a model's overall level of "surprise" when encountering a particular output -- has gained significant traction in recent years, both as a loss function and as a simple-to-compute metric of model quality. Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nash regret has recently emerged as a principled fairness-aware performance metric for stochastic multi-armed bandits, motivated by the Nash Social Welfare objective. Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Policies learned via continuous actor-critic methods often exhibit erratic, high-frequency oscillations, making them unsuitable for physical deployment. Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22980v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structured sparsity has emerged as a popular model pruning technique, widely adopted in various architectures, including CNNs, Transformer models, and especially large language models (LLMs) in recent years. A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.   In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22985v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose dgMARK, a decoding-guided watermarking method for discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs). Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs can generate tokens in arbitrary order. While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant. Watermarks are detected via elevated parity-matching statistics, and a sliding-window detector ensures robustness under post-editing operations including insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.

Empirically, we demonstrate that VaR-CPO is capable of safe exploration, achieving zero constraint violations during training in feasible environments, a critical property that baseline methods fail to uphold. To overcome the inherent non-differentiability of the VaR constraint, we employ the one-sided Chebyshev inequality to obtain a tractable surrogate based on the first two moments of the cost return. Additionally, by extending the trust-region framework of the Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO) method, we provide rigorous worst-case bounds for both policy improvement and constraint violation during the training process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23010v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) relies on policy constraints to mitigate extrapolation error, where both the constraint form and constraint strength critically shape performance. However, most existing methods commit to a single constraint family: weighted behavior cloning, density regularization, or support constraints, without a unified principle that explains their connections or trade-offs. In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection. Experiments on D4RL and NeoRL2 demonstrate robust gains across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance overall.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23011v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable control of myoelectric prostheses is often hindered by high inter-subject variability and the clinical impracticality of high-density sensor arrays. This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Memory agents, which depart from predefined memory-processing pipelines by endogenously managing the processing, storage, and retrieval of memories, have garnered increasing attention for their autonomy and adaptability. However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\sim24.45\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23026v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Root cause analysis of anomalies aims to identify those features that cause the deviation from the normal process. Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent ("true") and observed ("measured") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice. Experiments show that our method matches state-of-the-art performance in root cause localization, while it additionally enables accurate classification of anomaly types, and remains robust even when the causal DAG is unknown.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long chain-of-thought reasoning (Long CoT) is now fundamental to state-of-the-art LLMs, especially in mathematical reasoning. However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Differentiable matching layers, often implemented via entropy-regularized Optimal Transport, serve as a critical approximate inference mechanism in structural prediction. However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $\epsilon \to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\epsilon)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins. To address this, we propose \textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$. Our implementation and interactive demo are available at https://github.com/xxx0438/torch-sinkhorn-asc and https://huggingface.co/spaces/leon0923/torch-sinkhorn-asc-demo. bounded away from zero in generic training dynamics unless the feature extractor converges unrealistically fast.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating realistic graph-structured data is challenging due to discrete structures, variable sizes, and class-specific connectivity patterns that resist conventional generative modelling. While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23058v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, where group-based approaches such as GRPO have emerged as efficient paradigms that optimize policies by leveraging intra-group performance differences. However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability. Experimental results demonstrate that RLRR yields consistent performance improvements over standard group-based baselines across reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computing the importance of features in supervised classification tasks is critical for model interpretability. Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.   Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23072v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow matching is a scalable generative framework for characterizing continuous normalizing flows with wide-range applications. However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\"ive higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: On-policy deep reinforcement learning remains a dominant paradigm for continuous control, yet standard implementations rely on Gaussian actors and relatively shallow MLP policies, often leading to brittle optimization when gradients are noisy and policy updates must be conservative. In this paper, we revisit policy representation as a first-class design choice for on-policy optimization. We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss. Building on architectural advances from supervised learning, we further propose regularized actor networks, while keeping critic design fixed. Our results show that simply replacing the standard actor network with our discretized regularized actor yields consistent gains and achieve the state-of-the-art performance across diverse continuous-control benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23096v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make accurate next token predictions but their confidence in these predictions can be poorly calibrated: high-confidence predictions are frequently wrong, and low-confidence predictions may be correct. This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets. We also introduce Confidence@k, a test-time scaling mechanism leveraging calibrated token probabilities for Bayes-optimal selection of output tokens.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prevailing Direct Forecasting (DF) paradigm dominates Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) by forcing models to predict the entire future horizon in a single forward pass. While efficient, this rigid coupling of output and evaluation horizons necessitates computationally prohibitive re-training for every target horizon. In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty is critical for the safe deployment of ranking models in real-world applications. Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite huge successes on a wide range of tasks, neural networks are known to sometimes struggle to generalise to unseen data. Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key driver of language model reasoning. Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains. Together, these results provide a principled account of when std normalization helps in GRPO, and offer broader insights into the design of critic-free RL algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23147v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integrity of time in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is crucial for reliable operation in energy cyber-physical systems, such as smart grids and microgrids. However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models have enjoyed widespread success in a variety of applications. However, they encounter inherent mathematical limitations in modeling distributions where samples are constrained by equalities, as is frequently the setting in scientific domains. In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry. Through theoretical analyses and empirical evidence on several representative tasks, we illustrate that our approach consistently enables data distribution recovery and stable sampling with both diffusion models and normalizing flows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As artificial neural networks, and specifically large language models, have improved rapidly in capabilities and quality, they have increasingly been deployed in real-world applications, from customer service to Google search, despite the fact that they frequently make factually incorrect or undesirable statements. This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update. The code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/behemoth.git.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23154v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pain management in intensive care usually involves complex trade-offs between therapeutic goals and patient safety, since both inadequate and excessive treatment may induce serious sequelae. Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23155v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Information-based data selection for instruction tuning is compelling: maximizing the log-determinant of the Fisher information yields a monotone submodular objective, enabling greedy algorithms to achieve a $(1-1/e)$ approximation under a cardinality budget. In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning. This achieves performance improvements with substantially lower training cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23156v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the problem of unsupervised skill segmentation and hierarchical structure discovery in reinforcement learning. While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandits with parameter noise model, in which the reward of action $a$ is $a^\top \theta$ where $\theta$ is sampled i.i.d. We show a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{O} (\sqrt{d T \log (K/\delta) \sigma^2_{\max})}$ for a horizon $T$, general action set of size $K$ of dimension $d$, and where $\sigma^2_{\max}$ is the maximal variance of the reward for any action. We further provide a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega} (d \sqrt{T \sigma^2_{\max}})$ which is tight (up to logarithmic factors) whenever $\log (K) \approx d$. For more specific action sets, $\ell_p$ unit balls with $p \leq 2$ and dual norm $q$, we show that the minimax regret is $\widetilde{\Theta} (\sqrt{dT \sigma^2_q)}$, where $\sigma^2_q$ is a variance-dependent quantity that is always at most $4$. This is in contrast to the minimax regret attainable for such sets in the classic additive noise model, where the regret is of order $d \sqrt{T}$. Surprisingly, we show that this optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret bound is attainable using a very simple explore-exploit algorithm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23169v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current neural architectures lack a principled way to handle interchangeable tokens, i.e., symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinguishable, such as bound variables. As a result, models trained on fixed vocabularies often struggle to generalize to unseen symbols, even when the underlying semantics remain unchanged. We propose a novel Transformer-based mechanism that is provably invariant to the renaming of interchangeable tokens. Our approach employs parallel embedding streams to isolate the contribution of each interchangeable token in the input, combined with an aggregated attention mechanism that enables structured information sharing across streams. Experimental results confirm the theoretical guarantees of our method and demonstrate substantial performance gains on open-vocabulary tasks that require generalization to novel symbols.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23174v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23177v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T), a novel architecture that combines the global modeling capabilities of Transformers with the geometric inductive bias of MeshGraphNets, while preserving a mesh-based graph representation. MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.   We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23180v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their serial, autoregressive generation, especially as reasoning becomes a key capability and response sequences grow longer. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA families show that TriSpec achieves up to 35\% speedup over standard SD, with up to 50\% fewer target model invocations while maintaining comparable accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23181v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weight Space Learning (WSL), which frames neural network weights as a data modality, is an emerging field with potential for tasks like meta-learning or transfer learning. Particularly, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a convenient testbed, where each set of weights determines the corresponding individual data sample as a mapping from coordinates to contextual values. So far, a precise theoretical explanation for the mechanism of encoding semantics of data into network weights is still missing. In this work, we deploy the Implicit Function Theorem (IFT) to establish a rigorous mapping between the data space and its latent weight representation space. We analyze a framework that maps instance-specific embeddings to INR weights via a shared hypernetwork, achieving performance competitive with existing baselines on downstream classification tasks across 2D and 3D datasets. These findings offer a theoretical lens for future investigations into network weights.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23207v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding what graph neural networks can learn, especially their ability to learn to execute algorithms, remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Air pollution is a chronic problem in large cities worldwide and awareness is rising as the long-term health implications become clearer. Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic. The workflow we have designed is straightforward and adaptable to other contexts, like other cities beyond the specifics of our dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As acquiring reliable ground-truth labels is usually costly, or infeasible, crowdsourcing and aggregation of noisy human annotations is the typical resort. Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and corroborate the theoretical insights.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23225v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.   In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23233v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals. This perspective enables principled architectural design using classical optimization ideas. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles. The resulting architecture consistently outperforms a nanoGPT baseline on TinyStories and OpenWebText, demonstrating that optimization-theoretic insights can translate into practical gains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art generative learning models, namely conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, Invertible Neural Networks and Conditional Flow Matching. We apply them to a problem of gas turbine combustor design where we map six independent design parameters to three performance labels. We propose several metrics for the evaluation of this inverse design approaches and measure the accuracy of the labels of the generated designs along with the diversity. We also study the performance as a function of the training dataset size. Our benchmark has a clear winner, as Conditional Flow Matching consistently outperforms all competing approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works on language identification and generation have established tight statistical rates at which these tasks can be achieved. These works typically operate under a strong realizability assumption: that the input data is drawn from an unknown distribution necessarily supported on some language in a given collection. In this work, we relax this assumption of realizability entirely, and impose no restrictions on the distribution of the input data. We propose objectives to study both language identification and generation in this more general "agnostic" setup. Across both problems, we obtain novel interesting characterizations and nearly tight rates.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated strong empirical performance in pre-training large language models by performing matrix-level gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization in each layer independently. In this work, we propose TEON, a principled generalization of Muon that extends orthogonalization beyond individual layers by modeling the gradients of a neural network as a structured higher-order tensor. We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a practical instantiation of TEON based on the theoretical analysis with corresponding ablation. We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. Experimental results show that TEON consistently improves training and validation perplexity across model scales and exhibits strong robustness under various approximate SVD schemes.

We embed this sampling procedure within a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework, yielding a scalable generative PDE solver. Across multiple benchmark PDE systems as well as multiphysics and interacting PDE systems, our method produces solution fields with lower numerical error than existing state-of-the-art generative methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22269v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.   Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.   To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22290v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities yet remain fundamentally probabilistic, presenting critical reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents exhibit strong step-by-step reasoning capabilities over short horizons, yet often fail to sustain coherent behavior over long planning horizons. We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as decision engines for hiring, healthcare, and economic judgment, yet real-world human judgment reflects a balance between rational deliberation and emotion-driven bias. If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate "thinking" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Provably correct distributed protocols, which are a critical component of modern distributed systems, are highly challenging to design and have often required decades of human effort. These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness conditions are specified in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it. In experiments, we show that GGMS can learn correct protocols for larger settings than existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22401v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erd\H{o}s Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erd\H{o}s Problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22418v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient waste sorting is crucial for enabling circular-economy practices and resource recovery in smart cities. This paper evaluates both traditional machine-learning (Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost) and deep-learning techniques including custom CNNs, VGG16, ResNet50, and three transfer-learning models (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3) for binary classification of 25 077 waste images (80/20 train/test split, augmented and resized to 150x150 px). The paper assesses the impact of Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on traditional models. DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy (91 %) and ROC-AUC (0.98), outperforming the best traditional classifier by 20 pp. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed negligible benefit for classical methods, whereas transfer learning substantially improved performance under limited-data conditions. Finally, we outline how these models integrate into a real-time Data-Driven Decision Support System for automated waste sorting, highlighting potential reductions in landfill use and lifecycle environmental impacts.)

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22433v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this highly competitive employment environment, the selection of suitable personnel is essential for organizational success. This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks but suffer from high computational costs and latency. While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that B-PAC reasoning significantly reduces computational overhead, decreasing thinking model usage by up to 81.01\%, while controlling the performance loss below the user-specified level.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intrinsic Motivation (IM) is a paradigm for generating intelligent behavior without external utilities. The existing information-theoretic methods for IM are predominantly based on information transmission, which explicitly depends on the designer's choice of which random variables engage in transmission. In this work, we introduce a novel IM principle, Controllable Information Production (CIP), that avoids both external utilities and designer-specified variables. We derive the CIP objective from Optimal Control, showing a connection between extrinsic and intrinsic behaviors. CIP appears as the gap between open-loop and closed-loop Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies, which simultaneously rewards the pursuit and regulation of chaos. We establish key theoretical properties of CIP and demonstrate its effectiveness on standard IM benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22513v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs) achieve notable success in iteratively improving alignment without external feedback. Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents facilitate Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation but struggle with long-horizon, cross-application tasks due to limited context windows. While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A major challenge in training TableQA agents, compared to standard text- and image-based agents, is that answers cannot be inferred from a static input but must be reasoned through stepwise transformations of the table state, introducing multi-step reasoning complexity and environmental interaction. This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability. The repository is available at https://github.com/ThomasK1018/RE_Tab .

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sampling-based decoding underlies complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), where decoding strategies critically shape model behavior. Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies. Experiments on multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate improved generation performance, with gains in robustness and diversity metrics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has enabled automated task processing through reasoning and tool invocation capabilities. However, existing frameworks often operate under the idealized assumption that tool executions are invariably successful, relying solely on textual descriptions that fail to distinguish precise performance boundaries and cannot adapt to iterative tool updates. This gap introduces uncertainty in planning and execution, particularly in domains like visual content generation (AIGC), where nuanced tool performance significantly impacts outcomes. To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling. Our framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM), which replaces generic tool descriptions with a multi-dimensional scoring system based on fine-grained performance evaluations; (2) Adaptive Preference Update (APU), which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical rankings with actual execution rankings; and (3) Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO), which guides the planner to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate PerfGuard's advantages in tool selection accuracy, execution reliability, and alignment with user intent, validating its robustness and practical utility for complex AIGC tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22586v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal prediction under extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain) is challenging due to event rarity and dynamics. Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HQ-LV/WED-Net.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22595v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved mathematical reasoning through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interactive tool-using agents must solve real-world tasks via multi-turn interaction with both humans and external environments, requiring dialogue state tracking, multi-step tool execution, while following complex instructions. Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models. Overall, our results suggest a scalable pathway for bootstrapping complex tool-using behaviors without expensive human annotation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks through extended chain-of-thought generation, but their reliance on lengthy intermediate steps incurs substantial computational cost. We find that the entropy of the model's output distribution in early reasoning steps reliably distinguishes correct from incorrect reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose EntroCut, a training-free method that dynamically truncates reasoning by identifying high-confidence states where reasoning can be safely terminated. To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements have increasingly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct autonomous agents for complex problem-solving tasks. However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22636v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22645v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative medical AI now appears fluent and knowledgeable enough to resemble clinical intelligence, encouraging the belief that scaling will make it safe. But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.   We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.   We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.   Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22647v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22648v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The key to building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in endowing them with inherent uncertainty expression capabilities to mitigate the hallucinations that restrict their high-stakes applications. However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22664v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22701v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become powerful backbones for agents to autonomously operate in digital environments like the web and operating systems. However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has increasingly demonstrated strong ability to elicit reasoning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22758v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model agents often fail to accumulate knowledge from experience, treating each task as an independent challenge. Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets. A continuous maintenance mechanism scores, prunes, and merges patterns to prevent repository degradation. Evaluated on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and TravelPlanner, AutoRefine achieves 98.4%, 70.4%, and 27.1% respectively, with 20-73% step reductions. On TravelPlanner, automatic extraction exceeds manually designed systems (27.1% vs 12.1%), demonstrating its ability to capture procedural coordination.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks through iterative information retrieval. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for search-augmented reasoning predominantly rely on sparse outcome-level rewards, leading to a "Double Homogenization Dilemma." This manifests as (1) Process homogenization, where the thinking, reasoning, and tooling involved in generation are ignored. (2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale, high-quality interaction trajectories are essential for advancing mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22786v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22790v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large reasoning models have shown strong performance through extended chain-of-thought reasoning, yet their computational cost remains significant. Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22803v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Code verifiers play a critical role in post-verification for LLM-based code generation, yet existing supervised fine-tuning methods suffer from data scarcity, high failure rates, and poor inference efficiency. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22806v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The standard approach to representation learning on attributed graphs -- i.e., simultaneously reconstructing node attributes and graph structure -- is geometrically flawed, as it merges two potentially incompatible metric spaces. This forces a destructive alignment that erodes information about the graph's underlying generative process. To recover this lost signal, we introduce a custom variational autoencoder that separates manifold learning from structural alignment. By quantifying the metric distortion needed to map the attribute manifold onto the graph's Heat Kernel, we transform geometric conflict into an interpretable structural descriptor. Experiments show our method uncovers connectivity patterns and anomalies undetectable by conventional approaches, proving both their theoretical inadequacy and practical limitations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22896v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled rapid progress in automatic heuristic discovery (AHD), yet most existing methods are predominantly limited by static evaluation against fixed instance distributions, leading to potential overfitting and poor generalization under distributional shifts. We propose Algorithm Space Response Oracles (ASRO), a game-theoretic framework that reframes heuristic discovery as a program level co-evolution between solver and instance generator. ASRO models their interaction as a two-player zero-sum game, maintains growing strategy pools on both sides, and iteratively expands them via LLM-based best-response oracles against mixed opponent meta-strategies, thereby replacing static evaluation with an adaptive, self-generated curriculum. Across multiple combinatorial optimization domains, ASRO consistently outperforms static-training AHD baselines built on the same program search mechanisms, achieving substantially improved generalization and robustness on diverse and out-of-distribution instances.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22900v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve reasoning in multiple domains, yet outcome-only scalar rewards are often sparse and uninformative, especially on failed samples, where they merely indicate failure and provide no insight into why the reasoning fails. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage richer verbal feedback to guide RLVR training on failed samples, and how to convert such feedback into a trainable learning signal. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn feedback-guided reinforcement learning framework. It builds on three mechanisms: (1) dynamic multi-turn regeneration guided by feedback, triggered only on failed samples, (2) two complementary learning signals for within-turn and cross-turn optimization, and (3) structured feedback injection into the model's reasoning process. Trained on sampled OpenR1-Math, the approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning and RLVR baselines in-domain and generalizes well out-of-domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22948v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.

However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at https://github.com/yf-he/EvoClinician

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22975v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a cornerstone for unlocking complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training. This highlights the potential of automatically scaling up RLVR data by exploiting abundant, reasoning-rich, unverifiable internet text.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI systems evolve from isolated predictors into complex, heterogeneous ecosystems of foundation models and specialized adapters, distinguishing genuine behavioral novelty from functional redundancy becomes a critical governance challenge. Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\sigma^2\gamma^{-2}\log(Nd/\delta)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic AI systems act through tools and evolve their behavior over long, stochastic interaction traces. This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). We also show how run likelihoods enable anomaly detection as a guardrailing signal.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23032v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools, yet existing approaches depend on high-quality synthesized trajectories selected by scoring functions and sparse outcome-based rewards, providing limited and biased supervision for learning TIR. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23045v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with more general and consequential tasks. The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.

We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23049v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical calculators are fundamental to quantitative, evidence-based clinical practice. However, their real-world use is an adaptive, multi-stage process, requiring proactive EHR data acquisition, scenario-dependent calculator selection, and multi-step computation, whereas current benchmarks focus only on static single-step calculations with explicit instructions. To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation. Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation. Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains. Building on these findings, we develop CalcMate, a fine-tuned model incorporating scenario planning and tool augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models. Benchmark and Codes are available in https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/MedMCP-Calc.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23086v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning provides a significant performance uplift to LLMs by enabling planning, exploration, and deliberation of their actions. CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23133v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference-time scaling can amplify reasoning pathologies: sycophancy, rung collapse, and premature certainty. We present RAudit, a diagnostic protocol for auditing LLM reasoning without ground truth access. The key constraint is blindness: the auditor evaluates only whether derivation steps support conclusions, enabling detection of trace-output inconsistency and, when latent competence exists, its recovery. RAudit measures process quality via CRIT-based reasonableness scores and varies critique formulation to study how social framing affects model response. We prove bounded correction and $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ termination. Experiments on mathematical reasoning (CAP-GSM8K) and causal judgment (CausalL2) reveal four mechanisms explaining model unreliability: (1) Latent Competence Suppression, where models derive correct answers then overwrite them under social pressure; (2) The False Competence Trap, where weaker judges mask sycophancy that stronger judges expose; (3) The Complexity-Vulnerability Tradeoff, where causal tasks induce more than 10 times higher sycophancy than mathematical tasks; and (4) Iatrogenic Critique, where authoritative correction harms weaker models. These findings challenge assumptions that capability implies robustness and that stronger feedback yields better outputs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23143v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning tasks to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost. Code, models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/seanie12/ThinkSafe.git.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23179v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks on closed-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been increasingly explored under black-box transfer, yet prior methods are predominantly sample-specific and offer limited reusability across inputs. We instead study a more stringent setting, Universal Targeted Transferable Adversarial Attacks (UTTAA), where a single perturbation must consistently steer arbitrary inputs toward a specified target across unknown commercial MLLMs. Naively adapting existing sample-wise attacks to this universal setting faces three core difficulties: (i) target supervision becomes high-variance due to target-crop randomness, (ii) token-wise matching is unreliable because universality suppresses image-specific cues that would otherwise anchor alignment, and (iii) few-source per-target adaptation is highly initialization-sensitive, which can degrade the attainable performance. In this work, we propose MCRMO-Attack, which stabilizes supervision via Multi-Crop Aggregation with an Attention-Guided Crop, improves token-level reliability through alignability-gated Token Routing, and meta-learns a cross-target perturbation prior that yields stronger per-target solutions. Across commercial MLLMs, we boost unseen-image attack success rate by +23.7\% on GPT-4o and +19.9\% on Gemini-2.0 over the strongest universal baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series data are integral to critical applications across domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and environmental science. While recent work has begun to explore multi-task time series question answering (QA), current benchmarks remain limited to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce TSAQA, a novel unified benchmark designed to broaden task coverage and evaluate diverse temporal analysis capabilities. TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis. Spanning 210k samples across 13 domains, the dataset employs diverse formats, including true-or-false (TF), multiple-choice (MC), and a novel puzzling (PZ), to comprehensively assess time series analysis. Zero-shot evaluation demonstrates that these tasks are challenging for current Large Language Models (LLMs): the best-performing commercial LLM, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves an average score of only 65.08. Although instruction tuning boosts open-source performance: the best-performing open-source model, LLaMA-3.1-8B, shows significant room for improvement, highlighting the complexity of temporal analysis for LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promise for dynamic game content generation, but they face critical barriers, including narrative incoherence and high operational costs. Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model in sequential decision making. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem. In this work, we show that a robust policy iteration algorithm runs in strongly-polynomial time for $(s, a)$-rectangular $L_\infty$ RMDPs with a constant (fixed) discount factor, resolving an important algorithmic question.

Apart from autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture is one of the elds that can bene t most from these systems. Although LiDAR place recognition is a widely used technique in recent years to achieve accurate localization, it is mostly used in urban settings. However, the lack of distinctive features and the unstructured nature of agricultural environments make place recognition challenging. This work presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art the latest deep learning applications for agricultural environments and LPR techniques. We focus on the challenges that arise in these environments. We analyze the existing approaches, datasets, and metrics used to evaluate LPR system performance and discuss the limitations and future directions of research in this eld. This is the rst survey that focuses on LiDAR based localization in agricultural settings, with the aim of providing a thorough understanding and fostering further research in this specialized domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotics education fosters computational thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, but remains challenging due to technical complexity. Game-based learning (GBL) and gamification offer engagement benefits, yet their comparative impact remains unclear. We present the first PRISMA-aligned systematic review and comparative synthesis of GBL and gamification in robotics education, analyzing 95 studies from 12,485 records across four databases (2014-2025). We coded each study's approach, learning context, skill level, modality, pedagogy, and outcomes (k = .918). Three patterns emerged: (1) approach-context-pedagogy coupling (GBL more prevalent in informal settings, while gamification dominated formal classrooms [p < .001] and favored project-based learning [p = .009]); (2) emphasis on introductory programming and modular kits, with limited adoption of advanced software (~17%), advanced hardware (~5%), or immersive technologies (~22%); and (3) short study horizons, relying on self-report. We propose eight research directions and a design space outlining best practices and pitfalls, offering actionable guidance for robotics education.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22289v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We focus on multi-object rearrangement planning in densely cluttered environments using a car-like robot pusher. The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hardware experiments on a 1/10 car-like pusher demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Code and footage from our experiments can be found at: https://fluentrobotics.com/relopushboss.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic objects are simple actuated systems that subtly blend into human environments. We design and introduce Lantern, a minimalist robotic object platform to enable building simple robotic artifacts. We conducted in-depth design and engineering iterations of Lantern's mechatronic architecture to meet specific design goals while maintaining a low build cost (~40 USD). As an extendable, open-source platform, Lantern aims to enable exploration of a range of HRI scenarios by leveraging human tendency to assign social meaning to simple forms. To evaluate Lantern's potential for HRI, we conducted a series of explorations: 1) a co-design workshop, 2) a sensory room case study, 3) distribution to external HRI labs, 4) integration into a graduate-level HRI course, and 5) public exhibitions with older adults and children. Our findings show that Lantern effectively evokes engagement, can support versatile applications ranging from emotion regulation to focused work, and serves as a viable platform for lowering barriers to HRI as a field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22387v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Plants offer a paradoxical model for interaction: they are ambient, low-demand presences that nonetheless shape atmosphere, routines, and relationships through temporal rhythms and subtle expressions. In contrast, most human-robot interaction (HRI) has been grounded in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic paradigms, producing overt, high-demand forms of engagement. Using a Research through Design (RtD) methodology, we explore plants as metaphoric inspiration for HRI; we conducted iterative cycles of ideation, prototyping, and reflection to investigate what design primitives emerge from plant metaphors and morphologies, and how these primitives can be combined into expressive robotic forms. We present a suite of speculative, open-source prototypes that help probe plant-inspired presence, temporality, form, and gestures. We deepened our learnings from design and prototyping through prototype-centered workshops that explored people's perceptions and imaginaries of plant-inspired robots. This work contributes: (1) Set of plant-inspired robotic artifacts; (2) Designerly insights on how people perceive plant-inspired robots; and (3) Design consideration to inform how to use plant metaphors to reshape HRI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The contribution describes a pedestrian navigation approach designed to improve localization accuracy in urban environments where GNSS performance is degraded, a problem that is especially critical for blind or low-vision users who depend on precise guidance such as identifying the correct side of a street. To address GNSS limitations and the impracticality of camera-based visual positioning, the work proposes a particle filter based fusion of GNSS and inertial data that incorporates spatial priors from maps, such as impassable buildings and unlikely walking areas, functioning as a probabilistic form of map matching. Inertial localization is provided by the RoNIN machine learning method, and fusion with GNSS is achieved by weighting particles based on their consistency with GNSS estimates and uncertainty. The system was evaluated on six challenging walking routes in downtown San Francisco using three metrics related to sidewalk correctness and localization error. Results show that the fused approach (GNSS+RoNIN+PF) significantly outperforms GNSS only localization on most metrics, while inertial-only localization with particle filtering also surpasses GNSS alone for critical measures such as sidewalk assignment and across street error.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22445v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-resolution (5MP+) stereo vision systems are essential for advancing robotic capabilities, enabling operation over longer ranges and generating significantly denser and accurate 3D point clouds. However, realizing the full potential of high-angular-resolution sensors requires a commensurately higher level of calibration accuracy and faster processing -- requirements often unmet by conventional methods. This study addresses that critical gap by processing 5MP camera imagery using a novel, advanced frame-to-frame calibration and stereo matching methodology designed to achieve both high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to evaluate real-time performance by comparing real-time disparity maps with ground-truth disparity maps derived from more computationally intensive stereo matching algorithms. Crucially, the research demonstrates that high-pixel-count cameras yield high-quality point clouds only through the implementation of high-accuracy calibration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22467v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for robot control, but their dependence on action supervision limits scalability and generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective. During fine-tuning, a small set of labeled data is used to train the action head for control. Experimental results across various simulation tasks demonstrate CARE's superior success rate, semantic interpretability, and ability to avoid shortcut learning. These results underscore CARE's scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in robotic control with weak supervision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22517v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving human-level competitive intelligence and physical agility in humanoid robots remains a major challenge, particularly in contact-rich and highly dynamic tasks such as boxing. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions. In the final stage, we introduce Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP), where competing agents learn competitive tactics by interacting within the latent action space rather than the raw motor space, significantly stabilizing multi-agent training. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboStriker achieves superior competitive performance in simulation and exhibits sim-to-real transfer. Our website is available at RoboStriker.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22545v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time path planning in constrained environments remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency. Furthermore, we release our benchmark as an open-source resource for the community to foster future research in autonomous systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Exoskeletons show great promise for enhancing mobility, but providing appropriate assistance remains challenging due to the complexity of human adaptation to external forces. Current state-of-the-art approaches for optimizing exoskeleton controllers require extensive human experiments in which participants must walk for hours, creating a paradox: those who could benefit most from exoskeleton assistance, such as individuals with mobility impairments, are rarely able to participate in such demanding procedures. We present Exo-plore, a simulation framework that combines neuromechanical simulation with deep reinforcement learning to optimize hip exoskeleton assistance without requiring real human experiments. Exo-plore can (1) generate realistic gait data that captures human adaptation to assistive forces, (2) produce reliable optimization results despite the stochastic nature of human gait, and (3) generalize to pathological gaits, showing strong linear relationships between pathology severity and optimal assistance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22672v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conjoined collaborative robots, functioning as supernumerary robotic bodies (SRBs), can enhance human load tolerance abilities. However, in tasks involving physical interaction with humans, users may still adopt awkward, non-ergonomic postures, which can lead to discomfort or injury over time. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework that provides kinesthetic feedback to SRB users when a non-ergonomic posture is detected, offering resistance to discourage such behaviors. This approach aims to foster long-term learning of ergonomic habits and promote proper posture during physical interactions. To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial manipulators (AMs) are gaining increasing attention in automated transportation and emergency services due to their superior dexterity compared to conventional multirotor drones. However, their practical deployment is challenged by the complexity of time-varying inertial parameters, which are highly sensitive to payload variations and manipulator configurations. Inspired by human strategies for interacting with unknown objects, this letter presents a novel onboard framework for robust aerial manipulation. The proposed system integrates a vision-based pre-grasp inertia estimation module with a post-grasp adaptation mechanism, enabling real-time estimation and adaptation of inertial dynamics. For control, we develop an inertia-aware adaptive control strategy based on gain scheduling, and assess its robustness via frequency-domain system identification. Our study provides new insights into post-grasp control for AMs, and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22849v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient planning of assembly motions is a long standing challenge in the field of robotics that has been primarily tackled with reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods by using extensive physics simulations. This paper proposes a sample-efficient robust optimal control approach for the determination of assembly motions, which requires significantly less physics simulation steps during planning through the efficient use of derivative information. To this end, a differentiable physics simulation is constructed that provides second-order analytic derivatives to the numerical solver and allows one to traverse seamlessly from informative derivatives to accurate contact simulation. The solution of the physics simulation problem is made differentiable by using smoothing inspired by interior-point methods applied to both the collision detection as well as the contact resolution problem. We propose a modified variant of an optimization-based formulation of collision detection formulated as a linear program and present an efficient implementation for the nominal evaluation and corresponding first- and second-order derivatives. Moreover, a multi-scenario-based trajectory optimization problem that ensures robustness with respect to sim-to-real mismatches is derived. The capability of the considered formulation is illustrated by results where over 99\% successful executions are achieved in real-world experiments. Thereby, we carefully investigate the effect of smooth approximations of the contact dynamics and robust modeling on the success rates. Furthermore, the method's capability is tested on different peg-in-hole problems in simulation to show the benefit of using exact Hessians over commonly used Hessian approximations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22927v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated driving (AD) is promising, but the transition to fully autonomous driving is, among other things, subject to the real, ever-changing open world and the resulting challenges. However, research in the field of AD demonstrates the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to outperform classical approaches, handle higher complexities, and reach a new level of autonomy. At the same time, the use of AI raises further questions of safety and transferability. To identify the challenges and opportunities arising from AI concerning autonomous driving functionalities, we have analyzed the current state of AD, outlined limitations, and identified foreseeable technological possibilities. Thereby, various further challenges are examined in the context of prospective developments. In this way, this article reconsiders fully autonomous driving with respect to advancements in the field of AI and carves out the respective needs and resulting research questions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22930v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Trajectory planning is a core task in autonomous driving, requiring the prediction of safe and comfortable paths across diverse scenarios. Integrating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing "long-tail" scenarios. However, existing methods are constrained to single-turn reasoning, limiting their ability to handle complex tasks requiring iterative refinement. To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm. Additionally, we implement system-level optimizations to reduce data transfer overhead caused by high-resolution images and multi-turn sequences, achieving 2.5x training throughput. Our data, models, and code will be made available soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22965v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies (DP) have demonstrated significant potential in visual navigation by capturing diverse multi-modal trajectory distributions. However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive "generate-then-filter" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms. On Jetson Orin Nano, SIDP delivers a 2.5$\times$ faster inference than the baseline NavDP, i.e., 110ms VS 273ms, enabling efficient real-time deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.22988v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation demands visuomotor policies capable of robust spatial scene understanding and strong generalization across diverse camera viewpoints. While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile robots have become indispensable for exploring hostile environments, such as in space or disaster relief scenarios, but often remain limited to teleoperation by a human operator. This restricts the deployment scale and requires near-continuous low-latency communication between the operator and the robot. We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention. We further derive practical lessons learned in robot interoperability, networking architecture, team composition, and operator workload management to inform future multi-robot exploration missions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23080v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning a general humanoid whole-body controller is challenging because practical reference motions can exhibit noise and inconsistencies after being transferred to the robot domain, and local defects may be amplified by closed-loop execution, causing drift or failure in highly dynamic and contact-rich behaviors. We propose a dynamics-conditioned command aggregation framework that uses a causal temporal encoder to summarize recent proprioception and a multi-head cross-attention command encoder to selectively aggregate a context window based on the current dynamics. We further integrate a fall recovery curriculum with random unstable initialization and an annealed upward assistance force to improve robustness and disturbance rejection. The resulting policy requires only about 3.5 hours of motion data and supports single-stage end-to-end training without distillation. The proposed method is evaluated under diverse reference inputs and challenging motion regimes, demonstrating zero-shot transfer to unseen motions as well as robust sim-to-real transfer on a physical humanoid robot.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space.   We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution.   LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a novel inverse reinforcement learning framework using a diffusion-based adaptive lookahead planner (IRL-DAL) for autonomous vehicles. Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing robustness.We make our code publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2601.23285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shared autonomy systems require principled methods for inferring user intent and determining appropriate assistance levels. This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.
