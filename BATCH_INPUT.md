- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04727v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric, leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types. Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps, underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive multimodal research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a synthetic dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04753v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies, failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and (3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically, DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms), enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04779v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range. However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs, with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet, a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the pixel level.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04797v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit (e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04803v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04811v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data, while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance, providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term. We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape calculus.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location, the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS) formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04871v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios. Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27% misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively, marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04886v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a 17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers, while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information, enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block (FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block (TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments, showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04948v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks: classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future research in AI dentistry.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes, posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent. Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However, scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining, and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation. Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases. However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use. Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1) significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation, the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving 67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry; second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new, generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs, and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04972v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and techniques for TDA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are available here.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05034v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping, cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically, our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05044v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training. It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly, to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional MRIS pipelines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain) adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE, particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments. To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map. Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework, PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the original network architecture with minimal computational and modification overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy, and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05073v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10 used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples, paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals. Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10 demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to 96.5%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage, we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning, we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of adverse weather scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05106v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups. These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis, and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion. This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in all-weather autonomous driving.

Across four tasks involving four biomarkers and eight cohorts, JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and 1.2% average improvement over prior PFMs, advancing interpretable and robust AI-based biomarker detection in digital pathology.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05152v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3 model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05210v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL) [12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context. To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union (IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image segmentation.

We present FreeControl, a training-free framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control, enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5 percent additional cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05245v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift. The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies), we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously. To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features. The code is available at https://github.com/xcyao00/ADPretrain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network. The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast, noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.   Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.   Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC = 0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.   Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing manual workload and procedure time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05263v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third season, annotated with 2860 bounding boxes across 11 main characters. OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation. We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2 exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05292v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias, while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore, existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at https://github.com/joeeeeyin/CuisineSense.git.

This work introduces EmotionCLIP, which reformulates recognition as an EEG-text matching task within the CLIP framework. A tailored backbone, SST-LegoViT, captures spatial, spectral, and temporal features using multi-scale convolution and Transformer modules. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV datasets show superior cross-subject accuracies of 88.69% and 73.50%, and cross-time accuracies of 88.46% and 77.54%, outperforming existing models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05299v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05308v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions, particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new state-of-the-art.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05319v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography, an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present $\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data, featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework. This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation. The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances in 4D articulated object perception.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions. To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo), the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion understanding and captioning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and 28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30% and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

By connecting assembly instructions with the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO sculptures.

Yet creating high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone, age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05404v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05421v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However, existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead. Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time. Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks.

A Text-to-Vec module generates Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines, improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment, complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12 dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05464v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for images containing several identifiable individuals.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05467v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution, making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this, we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing event-based information. We develop five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed, achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal management.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance. On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP), outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to real-world challenges.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05477v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight, and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this, we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC), GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11 percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M), and shows improved interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05489v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05491v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities. To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning 19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders and constructing brain functional connectivity networks   by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,   treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within   specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.   While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be   optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.   To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each   brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture   both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional   network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations   for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE   datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The   code is available at https://github.com/XXYY20221234/Ada-FCN.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence time series forecasting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime, and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder. This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search. Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04760v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in low-data and evolving distribution settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04768v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse attention.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications, our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight, treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However, existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts. Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity, which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE (Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition, we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04790v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data (observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU. DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency, (2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04804v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization, semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact, interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and edge-spline networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04805v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50% compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space" $\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an "encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon \mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems having $M$ as an invariant manifold.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000 peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides. Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven antimicrobial peptide research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04825v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support vector machine.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1) fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of input prompts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization, showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions, with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with pre-trained image synthesis models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices. Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures, Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes. The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally, the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods, but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates (RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8% reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of deep learning for molecular modelling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04856v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04865v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for humanitarian supply chains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04902v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities, providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04904v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present \textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment, Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark, including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04907v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property $\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.   In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property $\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following [GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$ $\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04909v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer, often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c) as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity, and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04934v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these `unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies. Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

Recent studies have established global convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is crucial for healthcare institutions. This study addresses the growing prevalence of diabetes and its strong link to heart disease by proposing an efficient CVD risk prediction model for diabetic patients using machine learning (ML) and hybrid deep learning (DL) approaches. The BRFSS dataset was preprocessed by removing duplicates, handling missing values, identifying categorical and numerical features, and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. Several ML models, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and XGBoost, were implemented, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9050. Various DL models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as hybrid models combining CNN with LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, were also explored. Some of these models achieved perfect recall (1.00), with the LSTM model achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9050. Our research highlights the effectiveness of ML and DL models in predicting CVD risk among diabetic patients, automating and enhancing clinical decision-making. High accuracy and F1 scores demonstrate these models' potential to improve personalized risk management and preventive strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04979v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance. However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation, enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation, and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM with drastically reduced training time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04980v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models, neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these "black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP. Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME. Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a novel five dimensional framework evaluating Inherent Interpretability, Global Explanations, Local Explanations, Consistency, and Complexity to offer a nuanced method for assessing and comparing model explainability beyond simple accuracy metrics. This research demonstrates the feasibility of employing sophisticated, high performing ML models in regulated financial environments by utilizing modern explainability techniques and provides a structured approach to evaluate the crucial trade offs between model performance and interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers, hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion. Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate $\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structure-based drug design has seen significant advancements with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the generation of hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder. Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive small molecules from protein binding pockets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04988v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches, have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05005v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure, preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1% (PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition, precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular, complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA) dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear, sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model. This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs or with indifference feedback.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05169v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory, imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected. Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches. Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps. Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1 year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch - achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01). Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05171v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise. Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05177v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel countermeasure strategy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05179v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

We derive a control-variate-based technique that ensures our updates are unbiased estimates of the true gradient. Moreover, we propose a novel way to derive a predictor for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer classification task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex, non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework, a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05265v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover, compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the total training time required while achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in training efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects. This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$ injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied, while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty quantification for risk assessment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05289v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress & Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once, unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring 2-9x lower total memory usage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05325v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content (e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws, in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05355v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design that generates structured media geometries directly from target differential scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization. Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure, naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds. These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05396v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through comprehensive numerical experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05420v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay (ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable, real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05442v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%. Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads, leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

We propose a clustered multitask approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within each cluster.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and 0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where material properties are treated as design variables.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05460v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

However, the application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology remains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these unsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models from statistics. Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these clustering methods, leading to the development of a novel model named SiamMM. Our method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised learning benchmarks. Inspection of the learned clusters reveals a strong resemblance to unseen ground truth labels, uncovering potential instances of mislabeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05471v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are skillful, transferable and global.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05480v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently, this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and learned velocities corroborate our theory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05482v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5% over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios, limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04880v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval, limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving. Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.   We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i) large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA (TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without sacrificing baseline capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04898v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment: hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning, existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses, and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04956v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles (run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions, considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve, revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a sequential decision-making framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05375v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources, and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting, ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision achievable.   This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction), and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with computational reasoning capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04758v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However, controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning & scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at https://schedulestream.github.io.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04769v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description, ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships, relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation, (iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks, generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for improved generalization and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04812v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation. Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies, such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong performance, and robustness under noisy observations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04827v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The reproducibility crisis in scientific computing constrains robotics research. Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex. These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers. Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates progress in robotics and AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04831v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Isaac Lab, the natural successor to Isaac Gym, which extends the paradigm of GPU-native robotics simulation into the era of large-scale multi-modal learning. Isaac Lab combines high-fidelity GPU parallel physics, photorealistic rendering, and a modular, composable architecture for designing environments and training robot policies. Beyond physics and rendering, the framework integrates actuator models, multi-frequency sensor simulation, data collection pipelines, and domain randomization tools, unifying best practices for reinforcement and imitation learning at scale within a single extensible platform. We highlight its application to a diverse set of challenges, including whole-body control, cross-embodiment mobility, contact-rich and dexterous manipulation, and the integration of human demonstrations for skill acquisition. Finally, we discuss upcoming integration with the differentiable, GPU-accelerated Newton physics engine, which promises new opportunities for scalable, data-efficient, and gradient-based approaches to robot learning. We believe Isaac Lab's combination of advanced simulation capabilities, rich sensing, and data-center scale execution will help unlock the next generation of breakthroughs in robotics research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04835v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used to compute dynamically feasible robot paths. However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a novel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by biasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by (i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path predictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal prediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty. This process yields prediction sets around the initial-guess path that are guaranteed, with user-specified probability, to contain the optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides such probabilistically correct guarantees on the sampling regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently finds feasible paths faster and generalizes better to unseen environments than existing baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solar energy is used for many mission-critical applications including space exploration, sensor systems to monitor wildfires, etc. Their operation can be limited or even terminated if solar panels are covered with dust or hit by space debris. To address this issue, we designed panel cleaning mechanisms and tested protective materials. For cleaning mechanisms, we designed and compared a wiper system and a rail system. For protective materials, we found through collision tests that polycarbonate was very promising, though the most important factor was layering a soft material between the panel's surface and a hard material. In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was more efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and total power consumption.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets, such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in the field of Embodied Intelligence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This article presents a method for computing the largest singularity-free sphere (SFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM) over a specified orientation workspace. For a fixed orientation of the moving platform, the SFS is computed analytically. This process is repeated over a set of samples generated within the orientation workspace, and the smallest among them is designated as the desired SFS for the given orientation workspace. Numerical experiments are performed on four distinct architectures of the SGPM to understand their relative performances w.r.t. SFS volumes over the same orientation workspace. This study demonstrates the potential utility of the proposed computational method both in analysis and design of SGPMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.04994v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking is imperative in networked robotic systems, particularly for haptics-enabled human-robot interaction. Recent literature has integrated human biomechanics into the stabilizers implemented for teleoperation, enhancing force preservation while guaranteeing convergence and safety. However, position desynchronization due to imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors remains a challenge. This paper proposes a two-port biomechanics-aware passivity-based synchronizer and stabilizer, referred to as TBPS2. This stabilizer optimizes position synchronization by leveraging human biomechanics while reducing the stabilizer's conservatism in its activation. We provide the mathematical design synthesis of the stabilizer and the proof of stability. We also conducted a series of grid simulations and systematic experiments, comparing their performance with that of state-of-the-art solutions under varying time delays and environmental conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful framework for robotic visuomotor control, yet they often lack the robustness to recover from subtask failures in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks and their learned representations of observations are often difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose the Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are available at the https://moe-dp-website.github.io/MoE-DP-Website/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05026v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic (CMND) systems have emerged as a key architecture with applications in several complex network systems, such as multilateral telerobotics and multi-agent control. These systems consist of a hub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a networked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can be affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based approaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like small-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers have several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems in a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying on the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems. It consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow and an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed dissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2 stability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance based on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring stability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks while relaxing the dissipation on other nodes. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed frameworks performance in a complex task under different time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing the remote nodes minimum phase and passivity assumption, enhancing the scalability and generalizability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05033v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Epically Powerful is an open-source robotics infrastructure that streamlines the underlying framework of wearable robotic systems - managing communication protocols, clocking, actuator commands, visualization, sensor data acquisition, data logging, and more - while also providing comprehensive guides for hardware selection, system assembly, and controller implementation. Epically Powerful contains a code base enabling simplified user implementation via Python that seamlessly interfaces with various commercial state-of-the-art quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuators, single-board computers, and common sensors, provides example controllers, and enables real-time visualization. To further support device development, the package also includes a recommended parts list and compatibility guide and detailed documentation on hardware and software implementation. The goal of Epically Powerful is to lower the barrier to developing and deploying custom wearable robotic systems without a pre-specified form factor, enabling researchers to go from raw hardware to modular, robust devices quickly and effectively. Though originally designed with wearable robotics in mind, Epically Powerful is broadly applicable to other robotic domains that utilize QDD actuators, single-board computers, and sensors for closed-loop control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex real-world environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage. Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process. Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks, including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4% on average respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of the typical deployment environment: large indoor spaces or urban areas that are potentially crowded and highly dynamic. While social navigation algorithms have progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother and overall better controllers, versus previously used manually-tuned controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates their usability in real-world production-level deployments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05185v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of autonomous systems has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, driven by their integration into sectors such as industry, medicine, logistics, and domestic environments. This expansion is accompanied by a series of security issues that entail significant risks due to the critical nature of autonomous systems, especially those operating in human-interaction environments. Furthermore, technological advancement and the high operational and architectural complexity of autonomous systems have resulted in an increased attack surface. This article presents a specific security auditing procedure for autonomous systems, based on a layer-structured methodology, a threat taxonomy adapted to the robotic context, and a set of concrete mitigation measures. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated through four practical case studies applied to representative robotic platforms: the Vision 60 military quadruped from Ghost Robotics, the A1 robot from Unitree Robotics, the UR3 collaborative arm from Universal Robots, and the Pepper social robot from Aldebaran Robotics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks, such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities. We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification, and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data. Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of robotics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Today's autonomous agents can understand free-form natural language instructions and execute long-horizon tasks in a manner akin to human-level reasoning. These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained foundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are grounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice model, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes the master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive interaction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in everyday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and the apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We formalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space, where the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on interaction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution to proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement. To realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial perception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds the models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure stability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that prevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL on both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive dialogues.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05234v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data, TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e. positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05379v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction), a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers, fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models map visual inputs and language instructions directly to robot actions, they often rely on costly hardware and struggle in novel or cluttered scenes. We introduce EverydayVLA, a 6-DOF manipulator that can be assembled for under $300, capable of modest payloads and workspace. A single unified model jointly outputs discrete and continuous actions, and our adaptive-horizon ensemble monitors motion uncertainty to trigger on-the-fly re-planning for safe, reliable operation. On LIBERO, EverydayVLA matches state-of-the-art success rates, and in real-world tests it outperforms prior methods by 49% in-distribution and 34.9% out-of-distribution. By combining a state-of-the-art VLA with cost-effective hardware, EverydayVLA democratizes access to a robotic foundation model and paves the way for economical use in homes and research labs alike.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05402v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits. Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in sensor measurements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2511.05426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways, and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off. We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3 g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience, surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress, enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77 N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility, squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without compromising flight performance.
