- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15933v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event cameras are a new type of brain-inspired visual sensor with advantages such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The geometric calibration of event cameras, which involves determining their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, particularly in long-range measurement scenarios, remains a significant challenge. To address the dual requirements of long-distance and high-precision measurement, we propose an event camera calibration method utilizing a collimator with flickering star-based patterns. The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision. Through comprehensive real-world experiments across varying conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing event camera calibration methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce TurboDiffusion, a video generation acceleration framework that can speed up end-to-end diffusion generation by 100-200x while maintaining video quality. TurboDiffusion mainly relies on several components for acceleration: (1) Attention acceleration: TurboDiffusion uses low-bit SageAttention and trainable Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) to speed up attention computation. (2) Step distillation: TurboDiffusion adopts rCM for efficient step distillation. (3) W8A8 quantization: TurboDiffusion quantizes model parameters and activations to 8 bits to accelerate linear layers and compress the model. In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.   We conduct experiments on the Wan2.2-I2V-14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P models. Experimental results show that TurboDiffusion achieves 100-200x speedup for video generation even on a single RTX 5090 GPU, while maintaining comparable video quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16133v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16143v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.   Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.   On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhihao0512/EDN.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16234v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16235v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dermatological conditions affect 1.9 billion people globally, yet accurate diagnosis remains challenging due to limited specialist availability and complex clinical presentations. Family history significantly influences skin disease susceptibility and treatment responses, but is often underutilized in diagnostic processes. This research addresses the critical question: How can AI-powered systems integrate family history data with clinical imaging to enhance dermatological diagnosis while supporting clinical trial validation and real-world implementation?   We developed a comprehensive multi-modal AI framework that combines deep learning-based image analysis with structured clinical data, including detailed family history patterns. Our approach employs interpretable convolutional neural networks integrated with clinical decision trees that incorporate hereditary risk factors. The methodology includes prospective clinical trials across diverse healthcare settings to validate AI-assisted diagnosis against traditional clinical assessment.   In this work, validation was conducted with healthcare professionals to assess AI-assisted outputs against clinical expectations; prospective clinical trials across diverse healthcare settings are proposed as future work. The integrated AI system demonstrates enhanced diagnostic accuracy when family history data is incorporated, particularly for hereditary skin conditions such as melanoma, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Expert feedback indicates potential for improved early detection and more personalized recommendations; formal clinical trials are planned. The framework is designed for integration into clinical workflows while maintaining interpretability through explainable AI mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16270v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16294v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic overlap among land-cover categories, highly imbalanced label distributions, and complex inter-class co-occurrence patterns constitute significant challenges for multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval. In this article, Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning (MACL) is introduced as an extension of contrastive learning to address them. It integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling to achieve balanced representation learning across both common and rare categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD), show that MACL consistently outperforms contrastive-loss based baselines, effectively mitigating semantic imbalance and delivering more reliable retrieval performance in large-scale remote-sensing archives. Code, pretrained models, and evaluation scripts will be released at https://github.com/amna/MACL upon acceptance.

Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of fine-grained generation capabilities. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. We find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases. The findings not only signal exciting progress in the field but also provide insights into future research related to multimodality, reasoning, interpretability and benchmarking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16325v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16349v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16360v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16371v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16413v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16484v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16494v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: GUI grounding is a critical component in building capable GUI agents. However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16511v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16523v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16561v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.   Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.   The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16567v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16586v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces Hazedefy, a lightweight and application-focused dehazing pipeline intended for real-time video and live camera feed enhancement. Hazedefy prioritizes computational simplicity and practical deployability on consumer-grade hardware, building upon the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) concept and the atmospheric scattering model. Key elements include gamma-adaptive reconstruction, a fast transmission approximation with lower bounds for numerical stability, a stabilized atmospheric light estimator based on fractional top-pixel averaging, and an optional color balance stage. The pipeline is suitable for mobile and embedded applications, as experimental demonstrations on real-world images and videos show improved visibility and contrast without requiring GPU acceleration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16615v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16620v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16635v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/SARMAE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16636v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16670v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16688v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled highly realistic image manipulations, including inpainting and region-level editing. These approaches preserve most of the original visual context and are increasingly exploited in cybersecurity-relevant threat scenarios. While numerous detectors have been proposed for identifying fully synthetic images, their ability to generalize to localized manipulations remains insufficiently characterized. This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16706v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16727v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16740v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

In this work, we propose TreeNet, a novel low-complexity image compression model that leverages a binary tree-structured encoder-decoder architecture to achieve efficient representation and reconstruction. We employ attentional feature fusion mechanism to effectively integrate features from multiple branches. We evaluate TreeNet on three widely used benchmark datasets and compare its performance against competing methods including JPEG AI, a recent standard in learning-based image compression. At low bitrates, TreeNet achieves an average improvement of 4.83% in BD-rate over JPEG AI, while reducing model complexity by 87.82%. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the influence of various latent representations within TreeNet, offering deeper insights into the factors contributing to reconstruction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16767v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16811v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16826v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the evolving landscape of traffic management and vehicle surveillance, efficient license plate detection and recognition are indispensable. Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems. This effort marks a significant stride towards the development of smarter and more efficient urban infrastructures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16842v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16853v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16880v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge of the physical material properties governing the dynamics of a real-world object becomes necessary to accurately anticipate its response to unseen interactions. Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16891v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16893v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16900v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16906v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Instruction-based video editing aims to modify an input video according to a natural-language instruction while preserving content fidelity and temporal coherence. However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16907v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prior works on 3D hand trajectory prediction are constrained by datasets that decouple motion from semantic supervision and by models that weakly link reasoning and action. To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16908v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying objects that have been added, removed, or moved between a pair of captures (images or videos) of the same scene at different times. Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed. We introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, comprising 350 diverse video pairs with thousands of changed objects. We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks. Our method aligns the captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic region features to detect changes. Experiments on multi-view and two-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements). The benchmark and code will be publicly released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16909v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16910v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16918v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16919v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/wzzheng/DVGT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16921v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16922v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15721v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&amp;P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.   Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).   We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15742v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15744v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15746v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15747v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15748v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15753v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15755v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15756v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15757v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15758v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industry 4.0 is growing quickly, which has changed smart production by encouraging the use of real-time tracking, machine learning, and AI-driven systems to make operations run more smoothly. The main focus of this dissertation is on creating and testing an intelligent production system for XRIT that solves important problems like energy management, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions. The testing shows that the system makes working efficiency, energy management, and the ability to plan repairs much better. Moving the system to real-time data merging and looking for other ways to make it better will be the main focus of future work.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15759v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15760v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15761v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15762v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15764v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.   For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.   Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.   Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15767v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.   The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15926v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15931v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BarcodeMamba.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15934v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15938v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $\alpha_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15946v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15956v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15987v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,\sigma_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $\sigma_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.   In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $\sigma_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural Architecture Search is a powerful approach for automating model design, but existing methods struggle to accurately optimize for real hardware performance, often relying on proxy metrics such as bit operations. We present Surrogate Neural Architecture Codesign Package (SNAC-Pack), an integrated framework that automates the discovery and optimization of neural networks focusing on FPGA deployment. SNAC-Pack combines Neural Architecture Codesign's multi-stage search capabilities with the Resource Utilization and Latency Estimator, enabling multi-objective optimization across accuracy, FPGA resource utilization, and latency without requiring time-intensive synthesis for each candidate model. We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of hardware-aware neural architecture search for resource-constrained deployments and provides an open-source framework for automating the design of efficient FPGA-accelerated models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16013v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16032v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16037v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16074v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16086v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.   The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.   The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16111v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

INTELLECT-3 achieves state of the art performance for its size across math, code, science and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming many larger frontier models. We open-source the model together with the full infrastructure stack used to create it, including RL frameworks, complete recipe, and a wide collection of environments, built with the verifiers library, for training and evaluation from our Environments Hub community platform. Built for this effort, we introduce prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use. Using this stack, we run both SFT and RL training on top of the GLM-4.5-Air-Base model, scaling RL training up to 512 H200s with high training efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16184v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.   This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}{\mu}\log\!\frac{dL}{\mu\delta}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-\delta$ with $0<\delta<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16247v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications. We release the replication package at https://figshare.com/s/d5931192a8824de26aff.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16383v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16386v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16409v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.   To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.   This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16437v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting faults in wind turbine blades using com-putational learning techniques. The study evaluates two models: the first employs logistic regression, which outperformed neural networks, decision trees, and the naive Bayes method, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fault-related patterns. The second model leverages clustering and achieves superior performance in terms of precision and data segmentation. The results indicate that clustering may better capture the underlying data characteristics compared to supervised methods. The proposed methodology offers a new approach to early fault detection in wind turbine blades, highlighting the potential of integrating different computational learning techniques to enhance system reliability. The use of accessible tools like Orange Data Mining underscores the practical application of these advanced solutions within the wind energy sector. Future work will focus on combining these methods to improve detection accuracy further and extend the application of these techniques to other critical components in energy infrastructure.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16445v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16558v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16581v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16648v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16676v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16687v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16700v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16717v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16742v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16762v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16822v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.   We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16824v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16871v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16876v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16911v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16912v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.14709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.14766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.14792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.14910v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agricultural regions in rural areas face damage from climate-related risks, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and shifting weather patterns. Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15033v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15038v2 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15374v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/SCOPE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15435v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15489v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-quality mathematical reasoning supervision requires diverse reasoning styles, long-form traces, and effective tool integration, capabilities that existing datasets provide only in limited form. Leveraging the multi-mode generation ability of gpt-oss-120b, we introduce Nemotron-Math, a large-scale mathematical reasoning dataset containing 7.5M solution traces across high, medium, and low reasoning modes, each available both with and without Python tool-integrated reasoning (TIR).   The dataset integrates 85K curated AoPS problems with 262K community-sourced StackExchange-Math problems, combining structured competition tasks with diverse real-world mathematical queries. We conduct controlled evaluations to assess the dataset quality.   Nemotron-Math consistently outperforms the original OpenMathReasoning on matched AoPS problems. Incorporating StackExchange-Math substantially improves robustness and generalization, especially on HLE-Math, while preserving accuracy on math competition benchmarks.   To support efficient long-context training, we develop a sequential bucketed strategy that accelerates 128K context-length fine-tuning by 2--3$\times$ without significant accuracy loss. Overall, Nemotron-Math enables state-of-the-art performance, including 100\% maj@16 accuracy on AIME 2024 and 2025 with Python TIR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15567v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

We present two interconnected components: AIDA (an artificial artist social network) and the Ismism Machine, a system for critical analysis. The core innovation lies in leveraging deep learning and multi-agent collaboration to enable multidimensional simulations of art historical developments and conceptual innovation patterns. The framework explores a shift from traditional unidirectional critique toward an intelligent, interactive mode of reflexive practice. We are currently applying this method in experimental studies on contemporary art concepts. This study introduces a general methodology based on AI-driven critical loops, offering new possibilities for computational analysis of art.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15712v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interpreting the internal activations of neural networks can produce more faithful explanations of their behavior, but is difficult due to the complex structure of activation space. Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15840v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning. Our website is available at https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.15994v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16011v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding how humans evaluate robot behavior during human-robot interactions is crucial for developing socially aware robots that behave according to human expectations. While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16024v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi robot payload transport system to carry payloads through an environment of unknown and uneven inclinations while maintaining the desired orientation of the payload. For this task, we used custom built robots with a linear actuator (pistons) mounted on top of each robot. The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed controller by testing it on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient and reliable UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains challenging. We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness. These results show that combining TD3 with replay prioritisation, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy-safety rules yields a robust and deployable solution for UAV navigation in cluttered scenes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modular manipulators composed of pre-manufactured and interchangeable modules offer high adaptability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16076v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulation testing is a fundamental approach for evaluating automated vehicles (AVs). To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method. Results show that it enhances the accuracy of interaction replication by 83.53% and boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across both vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics, with an improvement of 51.9%. Notably, the entire calibration process is fully automated, requiring no human intervention.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One-shot imitation learning (OSIL) offers a promising way to teach robots new skills without large-scale data collection. However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16367v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It's a practical approach using the ground-aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating reward design in humanoid locomotion, which could eliminate the need for tedious manual engineering. However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In vision-based robot manipulation, a single camera view can only capture one side of objects of interest, with additional occlusions in cluttered scenes further restricting visibility. As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As unmanned systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) become increasingly important to applications like urban sensing and emergency response, efficiently recruiting these autonomous devices to perform time-sensitive tasks has become a critical challenge. This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16469v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile visual crowdsensing enables large-scale, fine-grained environmental monitoring through the collection of images from distributed mobile devices. However, the resulting data is often redundant and heterogeneous due to overlapping acquisition perspectives, varying resolutions, and diverse user behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Tri-Select, a multi-stage visual data selection framework that efficiently filters redundant and low-quality images. Tri-Select operates in three stages: (1) metadata-based filtering to discard irrelevant samples; (2) spatial similarity-based spectral clustering to organize candidate images; and (3) a visual-feature-guided selection based on maximum independent set search to retain high-quality, representative images. Experiments on real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select improves both selection efficiency and dataset quality, making it well-suited for scalable crowdsensing applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16555v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of coordinating multiple robots to build 3-D structures. This problem consists of a set of mobile robots that interact with each other in order to autonomously build a predefined 3-D structure. Our approach is based on Supervisory Control Theory, and it allows us to synthesize from models that represent a single robot and the target structure a correct-by-construction reactive controller, called supervisor. When this supervisor is replicated for the other robots, then the target structure can be completed by all robots

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16724v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16760v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16793v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic generalization relies on physical intelligence: the ability to reason about state changes, contact-rich interactions, and long-horizon planning under egocentric perception and action. However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase. More results and videos available in https://reinforcegen.github.io/

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16881v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.16896v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic 3D scenes are essential for developing Physical AI and generative models. Existing procedural generation methods often have low output throughput, creating a significant bottleneck in scaling up dataset creation. In this work, we introduce Sceniris, a highly efficient procedural scene generation framework for rapidly generating large-scale, collision-free scene variations. Sceniris also provides an optional robot reachability check, providing manipulation-feasible scenes for robot tasks. Sceniris is designed for maximum efficiency by addressing the primary performance limitations of the prior method, Scene Synthesizer. Leveraging batch sampling and faster collision checking in cuRobo, Sceniris achieves at least 234x speed-up over Scene Synthesizer. Sceniris also expands the object-wise spatial relationships available in prior work to support diverse scene requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/rai-inst/sceniris
