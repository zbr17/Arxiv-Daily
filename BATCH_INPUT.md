- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Smart home lighting systems consume 15-20% of residential energy but lack adaptive intelligence to optimize for user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously. We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying adaptive AI on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling intelligent home automation without cloud dependencies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20624v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods. All implementation code and supplementary materials are publicly available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20630v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation model reliability assessment typically requires thousands of evaluation examples, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for real-world deployment. We introduce microprobe, a novel approach that achieves comprehensive reliability assessment using only 100 strategically selected probe examples. Our method combines strategic prompt diversity across five key reliability dimensions with advanced uncertainty quantification and adaptive weighting to efficiently detect potential failure modes. Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple language models (GPT-2 variants, GPT-2 Medium, GPT-2 Large) and cross-domain validation (healthcare, finance, legal), we demonstrate that microprobe achieves 23.5% higher composite reliability scores compared to random sampling baselines, with exceptional statistical significance (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.21). Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage. Our approach addresses a critical gap in efficient model evaluation for responsible AI deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20647v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20649v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI-driven applications powered by large language models has led to a surge in AI interaction data, raising urgent challenges in security, accountability, and risk traceability. This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories. Based on this model, a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings across involved entities. System performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) metrics, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of AAT under large-scale interaction recording. AAT provides a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20650v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20651v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face inherent limitations in memory, including restricted context windows, long-term knowledge forgetting, redundant information accumulation, and hallucination generation. These issues severely constrain sustained dialogue and personalized services. This paper proposes the Memory Bear system, which constructs a human-like memory architecture grounded in cognitive science principles. By integrating multimodal information perception, dynamic memory maintenance, and adaptive cognitive services, Memory Bear achieves a full-chain reconstruction of LLM memory mechanisms. Across domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and education, Memory Bear demonstrates substantial engineering innovation and performance breakthroughs. It significantly improves knowledge fidelity and retrieval efficiency in long-term conversations, reduces hallucination rates, and enhances contextual adaptability and reasoning capability through memory-cognition integration. Experimental results show that, compared with existing solutions (e.g., Mem0, MemGPT, Graphiti), Memory Bear outperforms them across key metrics, including accuracy, token efficiency, and response latency. This marks a crucial step forward in advancing AI from "memory" to "cognition".

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20652v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20664v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20745v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20798v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20806v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20831v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($\lambda$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20884v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\gamma$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\gamma$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[\theta]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20985v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.20996v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.21066v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.21080v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.21110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.21127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2512.21220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.
