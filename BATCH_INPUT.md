- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shoe print evidence recovered from crime scenes plays a key role in forensic investigations. By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07008v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable models should not only predict correctly, but also justify decisions with acceptable evidence. Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07011v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As industrial manufacturing scales, automating fine-grained product image analysis has become critical for quality control. However, existing approaches are hindered by limited dataset coverage and poor model generalization across diverse and complex anomaly patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce MAU-Set, a comprehensive dataset for Multi-type industrial Anomaly Understanding. It spans multiple industrial domains and features a hierarchical task structure, ranging from binary classification to complex reasoning. Alongside this dataset, we establish a rigorous evaluation protocol to facilitate fair and comprehensive model assessment. Building upon this foundation, we further present MAU-GPT, a domain-adapted multimodal large model specifically designed for industrial anomaly understanding. It incorporates a novel AMoE-LoRA mechanism that unifies anomaly-aware and generalist experts adaptation, enhancing both understanding and reasoning across diverse defect classes. Extensive experiments show that MAU-GPT consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all domains, demonstrating strong potential for scalable and automated industrial inspection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retinal imaging is fast, non-invasive, and widely available, offering quantifiable structural and vascular signals for ophthalmic and systemic health assessment. This accessibility creates an opportunity to study how quantitative retinal phenotypes relate to ocular and systemic diseases. However, such analyses remain difficult at scale due to the limited availability of public multi-label datasets and the lack of a unified segmentation-to-quantification pipeline. We present RetSAM, a general retinal segmentation and quantification framework for fundus imaging. It delivers robust multi-target segmentation and standardized biomarker extraction, supporting downstream ophthalmologic studies and oculomics correlation analyses. Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes. Trained with a multi-stage strategy using both private and public fundus data, RetSAM achieves superior segmentation performance on 17 public datasets. It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings. The resulting biomarkers enable systematic correlation analyses across major ophthalmic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and pathologic myopia. Together, RetSAM transforms fundus images into standardized, interpretable quantitative phenotypes, enabling large-scale ophthalmic research and translation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07013v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs), refusal mechanisms have become a critical component for ensuring responsible and safe model behavior. However, existing refusal strategies are largely \textit{one-size-fits-all} and fail to adapt to diverse user needs and contextual constraints, leading to either under-refusal or over-refusal. In this work, we firstly explore the challenges mentioned above and develop \textbf{C}onfigurable \textbf{R}efusal in \textbf{VLM}s (\textbf{CR-VLM}), a robust and efficient approach for {\em configurable} refusal based on activation steering. CR-VLM consists of three integrated components: (1) extracting a configurable refusal vector via a teacher-forced mechanism to amplify the refusal signal; (2) introducing a gating mechanism that mitigates over-refusal by preserving acceptance for in-scope queries; and (3) designing a counterfactual vision enhancement module that aligns visual representations with refusal requirements. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and various VLMs demonstrate that CR-VLM achieves effective, efficient, and robust configurable refusals, offering a scalable path toward user-adaptive safety alignment in VLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) powers cross-border e-commerce product listings; existing research focuses on machine translation evaluation, while visual rendering quality is critical for user engagement. When facing context-dense product imagery and multimodal defects, current reference-based methods (e.g., SSIM, FID) lack explainability, while model-as-judge approaches lack domain-grounded, fine-grained reward signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance. The dataset and model will be released upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07015v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate currency recognition is essential for assistive technologies, particularly for visually impaired individuals who rely on others to identify banknotes. This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 97.95% accuracy on controlled datasets, 92.84% on complex backgrounds, and 94.98% accuracy when combining all datasets. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and seven metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, and AUC. Additionally, explainable AI methods like LIME and SHAP are incorporated to enhance transparency and interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, particularly when images originate from multiple unrelated scenes and contain significant visual ambiguity. The Image Matching Challenge 2025 (IMC2025) highlights these difficulties by requiring both scene discovery and camera pose estimation under real-world conditions, including outliers and mixed content. This paper investigates the application of Gaussian-constrained representations inspired by LeJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to address these challenges. We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings. These findings suggest that theoretically motivated representation constraints offer a promising direction for bridging self-supervised learning principles and practical structure-from-motion pipelines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical component of clinical workflows, enabling accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, often resulting in loss of life, severe aircraft damage, and substantial financial costs. Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07025v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit puzzling failures in multi-object visual tasks, such as hallucinating non-existent elements or failing to identify the most similar objects among distractions. While these errors mirror human cognitive constraints, such as the "Binding Problem", the internal mechanisms driving them in artificial systems remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill "concept vectors" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07026v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the success of multimodal contrastive learning in aligning visual and linguistic representations, a persistent geometric anomaly, the Modality Gap, remains: embeddings of distinct modalities expressing identical semantics occupy systematically offset regions. Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP enable strong zero-shot recognition but suffer substantial degradation under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to improve robustness using only unlabeled test samples, yet most prompt-based TTA methods rely on entropy minimization -- an approach that can amplify spurious correlations and induce overconfident errors when classes share visual features. We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve strong image classification performance but lack interpretability and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neuro-fuzzy hybrids such as DCNFIS replace fully connected CNN classifiers with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to improve interpretability, yet their robustness remains underexplored. This work compares standard CNNs (ConvNet, VGG, ResNet18) with their ANFIS-augmented counterparts on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under gradient-based (PGD) and gradient-free (Square) attacks. Results show that ANFIS integration does not consistently improve clean accuracy and has architecture-dependent effects on robustness: ResNet18-ANFIS exhibits improved adversarial robustness, while VGG-ANFIS often underperforms its baseline. These findings suggest that neuro-fuzzy augmentation can enhance robustness in specific architectures but is not universally beneficial.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from real-world documents remains challenging due to substantial variations in layout structures, visual quality, and task-specific information requirements. Recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising potential for performing end-to-end KIE directly from document images. To enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across realistic and diverse application scenarios, we introduce UNIKIE-BENCH, a unified benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the KIE capabilities of LMMs. UNIKIE-BENCH consists of two complementary tracks: a constrained-category KIE track with scenario-predefined schemas that reflect practical application needs, and an open-category KIE track that extracts any key information that is explicitly present in the document. Experiments on 15 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial performance degradation under diverse schema definitions, long-tail key fields, and complex layouts, along with pronounced performance disparities across different document types and scenarios. These findings underscore persistent challenges in grounding accuracy and layout-aware reasoning for LMM-based KIE. All codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/UNIKIE-BENCH.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate dental diagnosis is essential for oral healthcare, yet many individuals lack access to timely professional evaluation. Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals. These approaches also require large amounts of expert-annotated data and often struggle to generalize across diverse real-world imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) data at inference time is crucial for many machine learning applications, especially for automation. We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant. COMBOOD scales linearly with the size of the embedding space, making it ideal for many real-life applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07044v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pipeline integrity is critical to industrial safety and environmental protection, with Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) detection being a primary non-destructive testing technology. Despite the promise of deep learning for automating MFL interpretation, progress toward reliable models has been constrained by the absence of a large-scale public dataset and benchmark, making fair comparison and reproducible evaluation difficult. We introduce \textbf{PipeMFL-240K}, a large-scale, meticulously annotated dataset and benchmark for complex object detection in pipeline MFL pseudo-color images. PipeMFL-240K reflects real-world inspection complexity and poses several unique challenges: (i) an extremely long-tailed distribution over \textbf{12} categories, (ii) a high prevalence of tiny objects that often comprise only a handful of pixels, and (iii) substantial intra-class variability. The dataset contains \textbf{240,320} images and \textbf{191,530} high-quality bounding-box annotations, collected from 11 pipelines spanning approximately \textbf{1,480} km. Extensive experiments are conducted with state-of-the-art object detectors to establish baselines. Results show that modern detectors still struggle with the intrinsic properties of MFL data, highlighting considerable headroom for improvement, while PipeMFL-240K provides a reliable and challenging testbed to drive future research. As the first public dataset and the first benchmark of this scale and scope for pipeline MFL inspection, it provides a critical foundation for efficient pipeline diagnostics as well as maintenance planning and is expected to accelerate algorithmic innovation and reproducible research in MFL-based pipeline integrity assessment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07045v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled complex reasoning. However, existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks remain heavily biased toward perception tasks, such as object recognition and scene classification. This limitation hinders the development of MLLMs for cognitively demanding RS applications. To address this, , we propose a Vision Language ReaSoning Benchmark (VLRS-Bench), which is the first benchmark exclusively dedicated to complex RS reasoning. Structured across the three core dimensions of Cognition, Decision, and Prediction, VLRS-Bench comprises 2,000 question-answer pairs with an average length of 71 words, spanning 14 tasks and up to eight temporal phases. VLRS-Bench is constructed via a specialized pipeline that integrates RS-specific priors and expert knowledge to ensure geospatial realism and reasoning complexity. Experimental results reveal significant bottlenecks in existing state-of-the-art MLLMs, providing critical insights for advancing multimodal reasoning within the remote sensing community.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pixel-level feature attributions are an important tool in eXplainable AI for Computer Vision (XCV), providing visual insights into how image features influence model predictions. The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07049v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online handwriting recognition using inertial measurement units opens up handwriting on paper as input for digital devices. Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A long-standing question in physical reasoning is whether video-based models need to rely on factorized representations of physical variables in order to make physically accurate predictions, or whether they can implicitly represent such variables in a task-specific, distributed manner. While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.   Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems employ multi-stage pipelines consisting of object detection networks followed by separate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules, introducing compounding errors, increased latency, and architectural complexity. This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neuronavigation is widely used in biomedical research and interventions to guide the precise placement of instruments around the head to support procedures such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Traditional systems, however, rely on subject-mounted markers that require manual registration, may shift during procedures, and can cause discomfort. We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01{\deg}$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results. The results suggest that integration of the data from the various camera sensors can improve the overall accuracy further. The proposed markerless neuronavigation methods can reduce setup cost and complexity, improve patient comfort, and expand access to neuronavigation in clinical and research settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Urban design profoundly impacts public spaces and community engagement. Traditional top-down methods often overlook public input, creating a gap in design aspirations and reality. Recent advancements in digital tools, like City Information Modelling and augmented reality, have enabled a more participatory process involving more stakeholders in urban design. Further, deep learning and latent diffusion models have lowered barriers for design generation, providing even more opportunities for participatory urban design. Combining state-of-the-art latent diffusion models with interactive semantic segmentation, we propose RECITYGEN, a novel tool that allows users to interactively create variational street view images of urban environments using text prompts. In a pilot project in Beijing, users employed RECITYGEN to suggest improvements for an ongoing Urban Regeneration project. Despite some limitations, RECITYGEN has shown significant potential in aligning with public preferences, indicating a shift towards more dynamic and inclusive urban planning methods. The source code for the project can be found at RECITYGEN GitHub.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07058v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data or concepts from trained models while preserving overall performance, a capability increasingly required by data protection regulations and responsible AI practices. Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07062v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scrap quality directly affects energy use, emissions, and safety in steelmaking. Today, the share of non-metallic inclusions (contamination) is judged visually by inspectors - an approach that is subjective and hazardous due to dust and moving machinery. We present an assistive computer vision pipeline that estimates contamination (per percent) from images captured during railcar unloading and also classifies scrap type. The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL). Best results include MAE 0.27 and R2 0.83 by MIL; and an MTL setup reaches MAE 0.36 with F1 0.79 for scrap class. Also we present the system in near real time within the acceptance workflow: magnet/railcar detection segments temporal layers, a versioned inference service produces railcar-level estimates with confidence scores, and results are reviewed by operators with structured overrides; corrections and uncertain cases feed an active-learning loop for continual improvement. The pipeline reduces subjective variability, improves human safety, and enables integration into acceptance and melt-planning workflows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Physical understanding remains brittle in omni-modal models because key physical attributes are visually ambiguous and sparsely represented in web-scale data. We present OmniFysics, a compact omni-modal model that unifies understanding across images, audio, video, and text, with integrated speech and image generation. To inject explicit physical knowledge, we build a physical data engine with two components. FysicsAny produces physics-grounded instruction--image supervision by mapping salient objects to verified physical attributes through hierarchical retrieval over a curated prototype database, followed by physics-law--constrained verification and caption rewriting. FysicsOmniCap distills web videos via audio--visual consistency filtering to generate high-fidelity video--instruction pairs emphasizing cross-modal physical cues. We train OmniFysics with staged multimodal alignment and instruction tuning, adopt latent-space flow matching for text-to-image generation, and use an intent router to activate generation only when needed. Experiments show competitive performance on standard multimodal benchmarks and improved results on physics-oriented evaluations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07065v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contactless and non-invasive estimation of mechanical properties of physical media from optical observations is of interest for manifold engineering and biomedical applications, where direct physical measurements are not possible. Conventional approaches to the assessment of image displacement and non-contact material probing typically rely on time-consuming iterative algorithms for non-rigid image registration and constitutive modelling using discretization and iterative numerical solving techniques, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM), which are not suitable for high-throughput data processing. Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution can synthesize rich details, but models trained on synthetic paired data often fail on real-world LR images due to distribution shifts. We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When embodied AI is expanding from traditional object detection and recognition to more advanced tasks of robot manipulation and actuation planning, visual spatial reasoning from the video inputs is necessary to perceive the spatial relationships of objects and guide device actions. However, existing visual language models (VLMs) have very weak capabilities in spatial reasoning due to the lack of knowledge about 3D spatial information, especially when the reasoning task involve complex spatial relations across multiple video frames. In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing explicit instructions, such as attribute manipulation, style transfer, and pose synthesis. However, these models often face challenges when dealing with implicit editing instructions, which describe the cause of a visual change without explicitly detailing the resulting outcome. These limitations arise because existing models rely on uniform editing strategies that are not equipped to handle the complex world knowledge and reasoning required for implicit instructions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios. With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward. Our results show that the proposed dataset and methods significantly narrow the gap with GPT-4o and Nano-Banana, demonstrating competitive performance not only in instruction following but also in knowledge plausibility, where many open-source systems typically struggle.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07100v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated floorplan generation aims to improve design quality, architectural efficiency, and sustainability by jointly modeling global spatial organization and precise geometric detail. However, existing approaches operate in raster space and rely on post hoc vectorization, which introduces structural inconsistencies and hinders end-to-end learning. Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on RPLAN dataset (FID = 1.84, MSE = 2.06) and leading results on LIFULL dataset. The proposed framework advances constraint-aware and scalable vector floorplan generation for real-world architectural applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07101v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: UAV navigation in unstructured outdoor environments using passive monocular vision is hindered by the substantial visual domain gap between simulation and reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07104v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced the capabilities to interpret and act on visual input in 3D environments, empowering diverse applications such as robotics and situated conversational agents. When MLLMs reason over camera-captured views of the physical world, a new attack surface emerges: an attacker can place text-bearing physical objects in the environment to override MLLMs' intended task. While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07106v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07149v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rise of generative models has led to increased use of large-scale datasets collected from the internet, often with minimal or no data curation. This raises concerns about the inclusion of sensitive or private information. In this work, we explore the presence of pregnancy ultrasound images, which contain sensitive personal information and are often shared online. Through a systematic examination of LAION-400M dataset using CLIP embedding similarity, we retrieve images containing pregnancy ultrasound and detect thousands of entities of private information such as names and locations. Our findings reveal that multiple images have high-risk information that could enable re-identification or impersonation. We conclude with recommended practices for dataset curation, data privacy, and ethical use of public image datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07174v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tissues from MRI scans is critical for neuroscience and clinical applications, but achieving consistent performance across the human lifespan remains challenging due to dynamic, age-related changes in brain appearance and morphology. While prior work has sought to mitigate these shifts by using self-supervised regularization with paired longitudinal data, such data are often unavailable in practice. To address this, we propose \emph{DuMeta++}, a dual meta-learning framework that operates without paired longitudinal data. Our approach integrates: (1) meta-feature learning to extract age-agnostic semantic representations of spatiotemporally evolving brain structures, and (2) meta-initialization learning to enable data-efficient adaptation of the segmentation model. Furthermore, we propose a memory-bank-based class-aware regularization strategy to enforce longitudinal consistency without explicit longitudinal supervision. We theoretically prove the convergence of our DuMeta++, ensuring stability. Experiments on diverse datasets (iSeg-2019, IBIS, OASIS, ADNI) under few-shot settings demonstrate that DuMeta++ outperforms existing methods in cross-age generalization. Code will be available at https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/DuMeta++.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although recent traffic benchmarks have advanced multimodal data analysis, they generally lack systematic evaluation aligned with official safety standards. To fill this gap, we introduce RoadSafe365, a large-scale vision-language benchmark that supports fine-grained analysis of traffic safety from extensive and diverse real-world video data collections. Unlike prior works that focus primarily on coarse accident identification, RoadSafe365 is independently curated and systematically organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that refines and extends foundational definitions of crash, incident, and violation to bridge official traffic safety standards with data-driven traffic understanding systems. RoadSafe365 provides rich attribute annotations across diverse traffic event types, environmental contexts, and interaction scenarios, yielding 36,196 annotated clips from both dashcam and surveillance cameras. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice question-answer sets, comprising 864K candidate options, 8.4K unique answers, and 36K detailed scene descriptions collectively designed for vision-language understanding and reasoning. We establish strong baselines and observe consistent gains when fine-tuning on RoadSafe365. Cross-domain experiments on both real and synthetic datasets further validate its effectiveness. Designed for large-scale training and standardized evaluation, RoadSafe365 provides a comprehensive benchmark to advance reproducible research in real-world traffic safety analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07251v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-driven super-resolution (SR) methods are often integrated into imaging pipelines as preprocessing steps to improve downstream tasks such as classification and detection. However, these SR models introduce a previously unexplored attack surface into imaging pipelines. In this paper, we present AdvSR, a framework demonstrating that adversarial behavior can be embedded directly into SR model weights during training, requiring no access to inputs at inference time. Unlike prior attacks that perturb inputs or rely on backdoor triggers, AdvSR operates entirely at the model level. By jointly optimizing for reconstruction quality and targeted adversarial outcomes, AdvSR produces models that appear benign under standard image quality metrics while inducing downstream misclassification. We evaluate AdvSR on three SR architectures (SRCNN, EDSR, SwinIR) paired with a YOLOv11 classifier and demonstrate that AdvSR models can achieve high attack success rates with minimal quality degradation. These findings highlight a new model-level threat for imaging pipelines, with implications for how practitioners source and validate models in safety-critical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transport-Based Morphometry (TBM) has emerged as a new framework for 3D medical image analysis. By embedding images into a transport domain via invertible transformations, TBM facilitates effective classification, regression, and other tasks using transport-domain features. Crucially, the inverse mapping enables the projection of analytic results back into the original image space, allowing researchers to directly interpret clinical features associated with model outputs in a spatially meaningful way. To facilitate broader adoption of TBM in clinical imaging research, we present 3D-TBM, a tool designed for morphological analysis of 3D medical images. The framework includes data preprocessing, computation of optimal transport embeddings, and analytical methods such as visualization of main transport directions, together with techniques for discerning discriminating directions and related analysis methods. We also provide comprehensive documentation and practical tutorials to support researchers interested in applying 3D-TBM in their own medical imaging studies. The source code is publicly available through PyTransKit.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07262v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Second-order feature statistics are central to texture recognition, yet current methods face a fundamental tension: bilinear pooling and Gram matrices capture global channel correlations but collapse spatial structure, while self-attention models spatial context through weighted aggregation rather than explicit pairwise feature interactions. We introduce TwistNet-2D, a lightweight module that computes \emph{local} pairwise channel products under directional spatial displacement, jointly encoding where features co-occur and how they interact. The core component, Spiral-Twisted Channel Interaction (STCI), shifts one feature map along a prescribed direction before element-wise channel multiplication, thereby capturing the cross-position co-occurrence patterns characteristic of structured and periodic textures. Aggregating four directional heads with learned channel reweighting and injecting the result through a sigmoid-gated residual path, \TwistNet incurs only 3.5% additional parameters and 2% additional FLOPs over ResNet-18, yet consistently surpasses both parameter-matched and substantially larger baselines -- including ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, and hybrid CNN--Transformer architectures -- across four texture and fine-grained recognition benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Creating photorealistic materials for 3D rendering requires exceptional artistic skill. Generative models for materials could help, but are currently limited by the lack of high-quality training data. While recent video generative models effortlessly produce realistic material appearances, this knowledge remains entangled with geometry and lighting. We present VideoNeuMat, a two-stage pipeline that extracts reusable neural material assets from video diffusion models. First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a "virtual gonioreflectometer" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions. The resulting materials exhibit realism and diversity far exceeding the limited synthetic training data, demonstrating that material knowledge can be successfully transferred from internet-scale video models into standalone, reusable neural 3D assets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models enable agents to plan by imagining future states, but existing approaches operate from a single viewpoint, typically egocentric, even when other perspectives would make planning easier; navigation, for instance, benefits from a bird's-eye view. We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07301v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease which arises due to diabetes mellitus. It might cause vision loss and blindness. To prevent irreversible vision loss, early detection through systematic screening is crucial. Although researchers have developed numerous automated deep learning-based algorithms for DR screening, their clinical applicability remains limited, particularly in lesion segmentation. Our method provides pixel-level annotations for lesions, which practically supports Ophthalmologist to screen DR from fundus images. In this work, we segmented four types of DR-related lesions: microaneurysms, soft exudates, hard exudates, and hemorrhages on 757 images from DDR dataset. To enhance lesion segmentation, an attention mechanism was integrated with DeepLab-V3+. Compared to the baseline model, the Attention-DeepLab model increases mean average precision (mAP) from 0.3010 to 0.3326 and the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.1791 to 0.1928. The model also increased microaneurysm detection from 0.0205 to 0.0763, a clinically significant improvement. The detection of microaneurysms is the earliest visible symptom of DR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07310v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current analysis of additive manufactured niobium-based copper alloys relies on hand annotation due to varying contrast, noise, and image artifacts present in micrographs, slowing iteration speed in alloy development. We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average. This ultimately enables convergence on strong, low-activation, precipitation hardened copper alloys for additive manufactured fusion reactor parts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a natural path toward comparable explanations across different representation spaces. However, current SAEs are trained per modality, producing dictionaries whose features are not directly understandable and whose explanations do not transfer across domains. In this study, we introduce LUCID (Learning Unified vision-language sparse Codes for Interpretable concept Discovery), a unified vision-language sparse autoencoder that learns a shared latent dictionary for image patch and text token representations, while reserving private capacity for modality-specific details. We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations. Our analysis reveals that LUCID's shared features capture diverse semantic categories beyond objects, including actions, attributes, and abstract concepts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to interpretable multimodal representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07343v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust semantic segmentation of road scenes under adverse illumination, lighting, and shadow conditions remain a core challenge for autonomous driving applications. RGB-Thermal fusion is a standard approach, yet existing methods apply static fusion strategies uniformly across all conditions, allowing modality-specific noise to propagate throughout the network. Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects. Experiments on the MFNet dataset demonstrate that CLARITY establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), achieving 62.3% mIoU and 77.5% mAcc.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07345v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a powerful acceleration paradigm, yet its stability is often compromised in Forbidden Zone, regions where the real teacher provides unreliable guidance while the fake teacher exerts insufficient repulsive force. In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07428v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: U-Net structure is widely used for low-light image/video enhancement. The enhanced images result in areas with large local noise and loss of more details without proper guidance for global information. Attention mechanisms can better focus on and use global information. However, attention to images could significantly increase the number of parameters and computations. We propose a Row-Column Separated Attention module (RCSA) inserted after an improved U-Net. The RCSA module's input is the mean and maximum of the row and column of the feature map, which utilizes global information to guide local information with fewer parameters. We propose two temporal loss functions to apply the method to low-light video enhancement and maintain temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the LOL, MIT Adobe FiveK image, and SDSD video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cq-dong/URCSA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We address the problem of reconstructing 3D surfaces from depth and surface normal maps acquired by a sensor system based on a single perspective camera. Depth and normal maps can be obtained through techniques such as structured-light scanning and photometric stereo, respectively. We propose a perspective-aware log-depth fusion approach that extends existing orthographic gradient-based depth-normals fusion methods by explicitly accounting for perspective projection, leading to metrically accurate 3D reconstructions. Additionally, the method handles missing depth measurements by leveraging available surface normal information to inpaint gaps. Experiments on the DiLiGenT-MV data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the importance of perspective-aware depth-normals fusion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) digitization-converting paper-based or scanned ECG images back into time-series signals-is critical for leveraging decades of legacy clinical data in modern deep learning applications. However, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets providing both ECG images and their corresponding ground truth signals with comprehensive annotations. We introduce PTB-XL-Image-17K, a complete synthetic ECG image dataset comprising 17,271 high-quality 12-lead ECG images generated from the PTB-XL signal database. Our dataset uniquely provides five complementary data types per sample: (1) realistic ECG images with authentic grid patterns and annotations (50% with visible grid, 50% without), (2) pixel-level segmentation masks, (3) ground truth time-series signals, (4) bounding box annotations in YOLO format for both lead regions and lead name labels, and (5) comprehensive metadata including visual parameters and patient information. We present an open-source Python framework enabling customizable dataset generation with controllable parameters including paper speed (25/50 mm/s), voltage scale (5/10 mm/mV), sampling rate (500 Hz), grid appearance (4 colors), and waveform characteristics. The dataset achieves 100% generation success rate with an average processing time of 1.35 seconds per sample. PTB-XL-Image-17K addresses critical gaps in ECG digitization research by providing the first large-scale resource supporting the complete pipeline: lead detection, waveform segmentation, and signal extraction with full ground truth for rigorous evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving a balance between high-fidelity visual quality and low-latency streaming remains a formidable challenge in audio-driven portrait generation. Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks. Notably, our Lite variant achieves an inference speed of 96 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, facilitating ultra-fast interaction without sacrificing visual coherence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07458v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for complex image editing but is currently constrained by the scarcity of reliable and fine-grained reward signals. Existing evaluators frequently struggle with a critical perception gap we term "Attention Collapse," where models neglect cross-image comparisons and fail to capture fine-grained details, resulting in inaccurate perception and miscalibrated scores. To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench. Furthermore, SpatialReward serves as a robust signal in online RL, boosting OmniGen2 by +0.90 on GEdit-Bench--surpassing the leading discriminative model and doubling the gain of GPT-4.1 (+0.45). These results demonstrate that spatial reasoning is essential for unlocking effective alignment in image editing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07463v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing amount of waste is a problem for the environment that requires efficient sorting techniques for various kinds of waste. An automated waste classification system is used for this purpose. The effectiveness of these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models depends on the quality and accessibility of publicly available datasets, which provide the basis for training and analyzing classification algorithms. Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability. Overall, this dataset offers a strong foundation for Machine Learning (ML) applications in environmental monitoring, recycling automation, and waste identification, and is publicly available to promote future research and reproducibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thermal infrared sensors, with wavelengths longer than smoke particles, can capture imagery independent of darkness, dust, and smoke. This robustness has made them increasingly valuable for motion estimation and environmental perception in robotics, particularly in adverse conditions. Existing thermal odometry and mapping approaches, however, are predominantly geometric and often fail across diverse datasets while lacking the ability to produce dense maps. Motivated by the efficiency and high-quality reconstruction ability of recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) techniques, we propose TOM-GS, a thermal odometry and mapping method that integrates learning-based odometry with GS-based dense mapping. TOM-GS is among the first GS-based SLAM systems tailored for thermal cameras, featuring dedicated thermal image enhancement and monocular depth integration. Extensive experiments on motion estimation and novel-view rendering demonstrate that TOM-GS outperforms existing learning-based methods, confirming the benefits of learning-based pipelines for robust thermal odometry and dense reconstruction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07495v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decoding visual representations from brain signals has attracted significant attention in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, the degree to which brain signals truly encode visual information remains unclear. Current visual decoding approaches explore various brain-image alignment strategies, yet most emphasize high-level semantic features while neglecting pixel-level details, thereby limiting our understanding of the human visual system. In this paper, we propose a brain-image alignment strategy that leverages multiple pre-trained visual encoders with distinct inductive biases to capture hierarchical and multi-scale visual representations, while employing a contrastive learning objective to achieve effective alignment between brain signals and visual embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a Fusion Prior, which learns a stable mapping on large-scale visual data and subsequently matches brain features to this pre-trained prior, thereby enhancing distributional consistency across modalities. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between retrieval accuracy and reconstruction fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07498v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has markedly advanced character animation, which synthesizes motioned videos by animating a static identity image according to a driving video. Explicit methods represent motion using skeleton, DWPose or other explicit structured signals, but struggle to handle spatial mismatches and varying body scales. %proportions. Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel implicit motion representation that compresses per-frame motion into compact 1D motion tokens. This design relaxes strict spatial constraints inherent in 2D representations and effectively prevents identity information leakage from the motion video. Furthermore, we design a temporally consistent mask token-based retargeting module that enforces a temporal training bottleneck, mitigating interference from the source images' motion and improving retargeting consistency. Our methodology employs a three-stage training strategy to enhance the training efficiency and ensure high fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our implicit motion representation and the propose IM-Animation's generative capabilities are achieve superior or competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting objects from UAV-captured images is challenging due to the small object size. In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency. The code is available at https://github.com/twangnh/zoomdet_code.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07523v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In modern complex environments, achieving accurate and efficient target localization is essential in numerous fields. However, existing systems often face limitations in both accuracy and the ability to recognize small targets. In this study, we propose a bionic stabilized localization system based on CA-YOLO, designed to enhance both target localization accuracy and small target recognition capabilities. Acting as the "brain" of the system, the target detection algorithm emulates the visual focusing mechanism of animals by integrating bionic modules into the YOLO backbone network. These modules include the introduction of a small target detection head and the development of a Characteristic Fusion Attention Mechanism (CFAM). Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), a bionic pan-tilt tracking control strategy is developed, which incorporates central positioning, stability optimization, adaptive control coefficient adjustment, and an intelligent recapture function. The experimental results show that CA-YOLO outperforms the original model on standard datasets (COCO and VisDrone), with average accuracy metrics improved by 3.94%and 4.90%, respectively.Further time-sensitive target localization experiments validate the effectiveness and practicality of this bionic stabilized localization system.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to learn structured scene representations that support compositional generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. However, OCL models are often not evaluated regarding these goals. Instead, most prior work focuses on evaluating OCL models solely through object discovery and simple reasoning tasks, such as probing the representation via image classification. We identify two limitations in existing benchmarks: (1) They provide limited insights on the representation usefulness of OCL models, and (2) localization and representation usefulness are assessed using disjoint metrics. To address (1), we use instruction-tuned VLMs as evaluators, enabling scalable benchmarking across diverse VQA datasets to measure how well VLMs leverage OCL representations for complex reasoning tasks. To address (2), we introduce a unified evaluation task and metric that jointly assess localization (where) and representation usefulness (what), thereby eliminating inconsistencies introduced by disjoint evaluation. Finally, we include a simple multi-feature reconstruction baseline as a reference point.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07534v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate identification of cat breeds from images is a challenging task due to subtle differences in fur patterns, facial structure, and color. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for classifying cat breeds using a subset of the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which contains high-resolution images of various domestic breeds. We employed the Global Context Vision Transformer (GCViT) architecture-tiny for cat breed recognition. To improve model generalization, we used extensive data augmentation, including rotation, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustment. Experimental results show that the GCViT-Tiny model achieved a test accuracy of 92.00% and validation accuracy of 94.54%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for fine-grained image classification tasks. Potential applications include veterinary diagnostics, animal shelter management, and mobile-based breed recognition systems. We also provide a hugging face demo at https://huggingface.co/spaces/bfarhad/cat-breed-classifier.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) at admission is routinely used to estimate the ischemic core and penumbra, while follow-up diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) provides the definitive infarct outcome. However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07540v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most existing CLIP-style medical vision--language pretraining methods rely on global or local alignment with substantial paired data. However, global alignment is easily dominated by non-diagnostic information, while local alignment fails to integrate key diagnostic evidence. As a result, learning reliable diagnostic representations becomes difficult, which limits their applicability in medical scenarios with limited paired data. To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07544v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning (OCL) decomposes visual scenes into distinct entities. Slot attention is a popular approach that represents individual objects as latent vectors, called slots. Current methods obtain these slot representations solely from the last layer of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), ignoring valuable, semantically rich information encoded across the other layers. To better utilize this latent semantic information, we introduce MUFASA, a lightweight plug-and-play framework for slot attention-based approaches to unsupervised object segmentation. Our model computes slot attention across multiple feature layers of the ViT encoder, fully leveraging their semantic richness. We propose a fusion strategy to aggregate slots obtained on multiple layers into a unified object-centric representation. Integrating MUFASA into existing OCL methods improves their segmentation results across multiple datasets, setting a new state of the art while simultaneously improving training convergence with only minor inference overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv3, provide rich feature representations for dense vision tasks. This study investigates the intrinsic few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) capabilities of frozen DINOv3 features through a training-free baseline, FSSDINO, utilizing class-specific prototypes and Gram-matrix refinement. Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation. Crucially, we conduct an Oracle-guided layer analysis, identifying a significant performance gap between the standard last-layer features and globally optimal intermediate representations. We reveal a "Safest vs. Optimal" dilemma: while the Oracle proves higher performance is attainable, matching the results of compute-intensive adaptation methods, current unsupervised and support-guided selection metrics consistently yield lower performance than the last-layer baseline. This characterizes a "Semantic Selection Gap" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features. Our work establishes the "Last-Layer" as a deceptively strong baseline and provides a rigorous diagnostic of the latent semantic potentials in DINOv3.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hussni0997/fssdino.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07554v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to seamlessly integrate specific identities into textual descriptions. However, existing training-free methods often rely on rigid visual feature injection, creating a conflict between identity fidelity and textual adaptability. To address this, we propose FlexID, a novel training-free framework utilizing intent-aware modulation. FlexID orthogonally decouples identity into two dimensions: a Semantic Identity Projector (SIP) that injects high-level priors into the language space, and a Visual Feature Anchor (VFA) that ensures structural fidelity within the latent space. Crucially, we introduce a Context-Aware Adaptive Gating (CAG) mechanism that dynamically modulates the weights of these streams based on editing intent and diffusion timesteps. By automatically relaxing rigid visual constraints when strong editing intent is detected, CAG achieves synergy between identity preservation and semantic variation. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that FlexID achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity consistency and text adherence, offering an efficient solution for complex narrative generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07555v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language-driven object navigation requires agents to interpret natural language descriptions of target objects, which combine intrinsic and extrinsic attributes for instance recognition and commonsense navigation. Existing methods either (i) use end-to-end trained models with vision-language embeddings, which struggle to generalize beyond training data and lack action-level explainability, or (ii) rely on modular zero-shot pipelines with large language models (LLMs) and open-set object detectors, which suffer from error propagation, high computational cost, and difficulty integrating their reasoning back into the navigation policy. To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer "Is this the target object?" and "Why should I take this action?" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: "think", "think summary", and "action", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation. Code and dataset available upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent unified models such as Bagel demonstrate that paired image-edit data can effectively align multiple visual tasks within a single diffusion transformer. However, these models remain limited to single-condition inputs and lack the flexibility needed to synthesize results from multiple heterogeneous sources. We present SIGMA (Selective-Interleaved Generation with Multi-Attribute Tokens), a unified post-training framework that enables interleaved multi-condition generation within diffusion transformers. SIGMA introduces selective multi-attribute tokens, including style, content, subject, and identity tokens, which allow the model to interpret and compose multiple visual conditions in an interleaved text-image sequence. Through post-training on the Bagel unified backbone with 700K interleaved examples, SIGMA supports compositional editing, selective attribute transfer, and fine-grained multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments show that SIGMA improves controllability, cross-condition consistency, and visual quality across diverse editing and generation tasks, with substantial gains over Bagel on compositional tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07565v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human identification at a distance (HID) is challenging because traditional biometric modalities such as face and fingerprints are often difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Gait recognition provides a practical alternative, as it can be captured reliably at a distance. To promote progress in gait recognition and provide a fair evaluation platform, the International Competition on Human Identification at a Distance (HID) has been organized annually since 2020. Since 2023, the competition has adopted the challenging SUSTech-Competition dataset, which features substantial variations in clothing, carried objects, and view angles. No dedicated training data are provided, requiring participants to train their models using external datasets. Each year, the competition applies a different random seed to generate distinct evaluation splits, which reduces the risk of overfitting and supports a fair assessment of cross-domain generalization. While HID 2023 and HID 2024 already used this dataset, HID 2025 explicitly examined whether algorithmic advances could surpass the accuracy limits observed previously. Despite the heightened difficulty, participants achieved further improvements, and the best-performing method reached 94.2% accuracy, setting a new benchmark on this dataset. We also analyze key technical trends and outline potential directions for future research in gait recognition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07566v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precise identification of individual cows is a fundamental prerequisite for comprehensive digital management in smart livestock farming. While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Purpose:Mammography screening is less sensitive in dense breasts, where tissue overlap and subtle findings increase perceptual difficulty. We present MammoColor, an end-to-end framework with a Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding (TDCE) module that converts single-channel mammograms into TDCE-encoded views for visual augmentation. Materials and Methods:MammoColor couples a lightweight TDCE module with a BI-RADS triage classifier and was trained end-to-end on VinDr-Mammo. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set, two public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast), and three external clinical cohorts. We also conducted a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) observer study with a washout period, comparing (1) grayscale-only, (2) TDCE-only, and (3) side-by-side grayscale+TDCE. Results:On VinDr-Mammo, MammoColor improved AUC from 0.7669 to 0.8461 (P=0.004). Gains were larger in dense breasts (AUC 0.749 to 0.835). In the MRMC study, TDCE-encoded images improved specificity (0.90 to 0.96; P=0.052) with comparable sensitivity. Conclusion:TDCE provides a task-optimized chromatic representation that may improve perceptual salience and reduce false-positive recalls in mammography triage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adopt a unified self-attention design that processes visual and textual tokens at every Transformer layer, incurring substantial computational overhead. In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07590v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a geology-driven machine learning method for automated rock joint trace mapping from images. The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07595v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training is the decisive step for converting a pretrained video generator into a production-oriented model that is instruction-following, controllable, and robust over long temporal horizons. This report presents a systematical post-training framework that organizes supervised policy shaping, reward-driven reinforcement learning, and preference-based refinement into a single stability-constrained optimization stack. The framework is designed around practical video-generation constraints, including high rollout cost, temporally compounding failure modes, and feedback that is heterogeneous, uncertain, and often weakly discriminative. By treating optimization as a staged, diagnostic-driven process rather than a collection of isolated tricks, the report summarizes a cohesive recipe for improving perceptual fidelity, temporal coherence, and prompt adherence while preserving the controllability established at initialization. The resulting framework provides a clear blueprint for building scalable post-training pipelines that remain stable, extensible, and effective in real-world deployment settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of "visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Metastatic Progression remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet predicting whether a primary tumor will metastasize and where it will disseminate directly from histopathology remains a fundamental challenge. Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling clinical decision structure enables robust and deployable prognostic prediction of metastatic progression and site tropism directly from primary tumor histopathology.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal understanding of advertising videos is essential for interpreting the intricate relationship between visual storytelling and abstract persuasion strategies. However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07643v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While emerging 3D medical foundation models are envisioned as versatile tools with offer general-purpose capabilities, their validation remains largely confined to regional and structural imaging, leaving a significant modality discrepancy unexplored. To provide a rigorous and objective assessment, we curate the UMD dataset comprising 490 whole-body PET/CT and 464 whole-body PET/MRI scans ($\sim$675k 2D images, $\sim$12k 3D organ annotations) and conduct a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of representative 3D segmentation foundation models. Through intra-subject controlled comparisons of paired scans, we isolate imaging modality as the primary independent variable to evaluate model robustness in real-world applications. Our evaluation reveals a stark discrepancy between literature-reported benchmarks and real-world efficacy, particularly when transitioning from structural to functional domains. Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility. This dataset and analysis establish a foundational cornerstone for future research to develop truly modality-agnostic medical foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07645v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Infographics are widely used to communicate information with a combination of text, icons, and data visualizations, but once exported as images their content is locked into pixels, making updates, localization, and reuse expensive. We describe \textsc{Images2Slides}, an API-based pipeline that converts a static infographic (PNG/JPG) into a native, editable Google Slides slide by extracting a region-level specification with a vision-language model (VLM), mapping pixel geometry into slide coordinates, and recreating elements using the Google Slides batch update API. The system is model-agnostic and supports multiple VLM backends via a common JSON region schema and deterministic postprocessing. On a controlled benchmark of 29 programmatically generated infographic slides with known ground-truth regions, \textsc{Images2Slides} achieves an overall element recovery rate of $0.989\pm0.057$ (text: $0.985\pm0.083$, images: $1.000\pm0.000$), with mean text transcription error $\mathrm{CER}=0.033\pm0.149$ and mean layout fidelity $\mathrm{IoU}=0.364\pm0.161$ for text regions and $0.644\pm0.131$ for image regions. We also highlight practical engineering challenges in reconstruction, including text size calibration and non-uniform backgrounds, and describe failure modes that guide future work.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07658v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The accuracy of the 3D models created from medical scans depends on imaging hardware, segmentation methods and mesh processing techniques etc. The effects of geometry type, class imbalance, voxel and point cloud alignment on accuracy remain to be thoroughly explored. This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07668v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The looking-in-looking-out (LILO) framework has enabled intelligent vehicle applications that understand both the outside scene and the driver state to improve safety outcomes, with examples in smart airbag deployment, takeover time prediction in autonomous control transitions, and driver attention monitoring. In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., "turn after that red building") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts. L-LIO augments driver and scene understanding through multimodal fusion of audio and visual sensing, offering new paths for safety intervention.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07680v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07689v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video understanding requires not only recognizing visual content but also performing temporally grounded, multi-step reasoning over long and noisy observations. We propose Process-of-Thought (PoT) Reasoning for Videos, a framework that makes the reasoning process explicit by structuring video inference into a sequence of lightweight, verifiable steps. PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools. We further introduce a unified representation for PoT traces that aligns intermediate decisions with temporal segments, which improves robustness to distractors and reduces hallucinated explanations. Extensive experiments on standard video reasoning tasks demonstrate that PoT consistently improves factual correctness and temporal grounding, while providing interpretable reasoning traces for diagnosis and downstream use.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable foreign-object anomaly detection and pixel-level localization in conveyor-belt coal scenes are essential for safe and intelligent mining operations. This task is particularly challenging due to the highly unstructured environment: coal and gangue are randomly piled, backgrounds are complex and variable, and foreign objects often exhibit low contrast, deformation, occlusion, resulting in coupling with their surroundings. These characteristics weaken the stability and regularity assumptions that many anomaly detection methods rely on in structured industrial settings, leading to notable performance degradation. To support evaluation and comparison in this setting, we construct \textbf{CoalAD}, a benchmark for unsupervised foreign-object anomaly detection with pixel-level localization in coal-stream scenes. We further propose a complementary-cue collaborative perception framework that extracts and fuses complementary anomaly evidence from three perspectives: object-level semantic composition modeling, semantic-attribution-based global deviation analysis, and fine-grained texture matching. The fused outputs provide robust image-level anomaly scoring and accurate pixel-level localization. Experiments on CoalAD demonstrate that our method outperforms widely used baselines across the evaluated image-level and pixel-level metrics, and ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The code is available at https://github.com/xjpp2016/USAD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of medical images, especially in capturing non-linear relationships within the data. We propose U-KABS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates the expressive power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture to enhance segmentation performance. The U-KABS model combines the convolutional and squeeze-and-excitation stage, which enhances channel-wise feature representations, and the KAN Bernstein Spline (KABS) stage, which employs learnable activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials and B-splines. This hybrid design leverages the global smoothness of Bernstein polynomials and the local adaptability of B-splines, enabling the model to effectively capture both broad contextual trends and fine-grained patterns critical for delineating complex structures in medical images. Skip connections between encoder and decoder layers support effective multi-scale feature fusion and preserve spatial details. Evaluated across diverse medical imaging benchmark datasets, U-KABS demonstrates superior performance compared to strong baselines, particularly in segmenting complex anatomical structures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07717v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation and lane detection are crucial tasks in autonomous driving systems. Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07768v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into lightweight networks is crucial yet challenging in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC), due to the reliance on fixed prompts and global alignment. To address this, we propose PAND (Prompt-Aware Neighborhood Distillation), a two-stage framework that decouples semantic calibration from structural transfer. First, we incorporate Prompt-Aware Semantic Calibration to generate adaptive semantic anchors. Second, we introduce a neighborhood-aware structural distillation strategy to constrain the student's local decision structure. PAND consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four FGVC benchmarks. Notably, our ResNet-18 student achieves 76.09% accuracy on CUB-200, surpassing the strong baseline VL2Lite by 3.4%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world deployment of adaptive traffic signal control, to date, remains limited due to the uncertainty associated with vision-based perception, implicit safety, and non-interpretable control policies learned and validated mainly in simulation. In this paper, we introduce UCATSC, a model-based traffic signal control system that models traffic signal control at an intersection using a stochastic decision process with constraints and under partial observability, taking into account the uncertainty associated with vision-based perception. Unlike reinforcement learning methods that learn to predict safety using reward shaping, UCATSC predicts and enforces hard constraints related to safety and starvation prevention during counterfactual rollouts in belief space. The system is designed to improve traffic delay and emission while preventing safety-critical errors and providing interpretable control policy outputs based on explicit models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07801v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In long-video understanding, conventional uniform frame sampling often fails to capture key visual evidence, leading to degraded performance and increased hallucinations. To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI-generated images proliferate across digital platforms, reliable detection methods have become critical for combating misinformation and maintaining content authenticity. While numerous deepfake detection methods have been proposed, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate fine-tuned models, leaving a critical gap in understanding out-of-the-box performance -- the most common deployment scenario for practitioners. We present the first comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art detection methods, comprising 23 pretrained detector variants (due to multiple released versions of certain detectors), across 12 diverse datasets, comprising 2.6~million image samples spanning 291 unique generators including modern diffusion models. Our systematic analysis reveals striking findings: (1)~no universal winner exists, with detector rankings exhibiting substantial instability (Spearman~$\rho$: 0.01 -- 0.87 across dataset pairs); (2)~a 37~percentage-point performance gap separates the best detector (75.0\% mean accuracy) from the worst (37.5\%); (3)~training data alignment critically impacts generalization, causing up to 20--60\% performance variance within architecturally identical detector families; (4)~modern commercial generators (Flux~Dev, Firefly~v4, Midjourney~v7) defeat most detectors, achieving only 18--30\% average accuracy; and (5)~we identify three systematic failure patterns affecting cross-dataset generalization. Statistical analysis confirms significant performance differences between detectors (Friedman test: $\chi^2$=121.01, $p<10^{-16}$, Kendall~$W$=0.524). Our findings challenge the ``one-size-fits-all'' detector paradigm and provide actionable deployment guidelines, demonstrating that practitioners must carefully select detectors based on their specific threat landscape rather than relying on published benchmark performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07815v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Facial age estimation is critical for content moderation, age verification, and deepfake detection, yet no prior benchmark has systematically compared modern vision-language models (VLMs) against specialized age estimation architectures. We present the first large-scale cross-paradigm benchmark, evaluating \textbf{34 models} -- 22 specialized architectures with publicly available pretrained weights and 12 general-purpose VLMs -- across \textbf{8 standard datasets} (UTKFace, IMDB-WIKI, MORPH, AFAD, CACD, FG-NET, APPA-REAL, AgeDB) totaling 1{,}100 test images per model. Our key finding is striking: \emph{zero-shot VLMs significantly outperform most specialized models}, achieving an average MAE of 5.65 years compared to 9.88 for non-LLM models. The best VLM (Gemini~3 Flash Preview, MAE~4.32) outperforms the best non-LLM model (MiVOLO, MAE~5.10) by 15\%. Only MiVOLO, which uniquely combines face and body features via Vision Transformers, competes with VLMs. We further analyze age verification at the 18-year threshold, revealing that non-LLM models exhibit 60--100\% false adult rates on minors while VLMs achieve 13--25\%, and demonstrate that coarse age binning (8--9 classes) consistently degrades MAE beyond 13 years. Our stratified analysis across 14 age groups reveals that all models struggle most at extreme ages ($<$5 and 65+). These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific architectures are necessary for age estimation and suggest that the field should redirect toward distilling VLM capabilities into efficient specialized models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging with in-plane undersampling enables highly accelerated MRI but yields a strongly coupled inverse problem with deterministic inter-slice interference and missing k-space data. Most diffusion-based reconstructions are formulated around Gaussian-noise corruption and rely on additional consistency steps to incorporate SMS physics, which can be mismatched to the operator-governed degradations in SMS acquisition. We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion. Experiments on fastMRI brain data and prospectively acquired in vivo diffusion MRI data demonstrate improved fidelity and reduced slice leakage over conventional and learning-based SMS reconstructions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07827v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Aerial Detection (OVAD) and Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) have emerged as two key paradigms for aerial scene understanding. However, each paradigm suffers from inherent limitations when operating in isolation: OVAD is restricted to coarse category-level semantics, while RSVG is structurally limited to single-target localization. These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding. To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07833v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning is widely used to improve the interpretability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the faithfulness of the generated reasoning traces remains unclear. Prior work has mainly focused on perceptual hallucinations, leaving reasoning level unfaithfulness underexplored. To isolate faithfulness from linguistic priors, we introduce SPD-Faith Bench, a diagnostic benchmark based on fine-grained image difference reasoning that enforces explicit visual comparison. Evaluations on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal two systematic failure modes, perceptual blindness and perception-reasoning dissociation. We trace these failures to decaying visual attention and representation shifts in the residual stream. Guided by this analysis, we propose SAGE, a train-free visual evidence-calibrated framework that improves visual routing and aligns reasoning with perception. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly evaluating faithfulness beyond response correctness. Our benchmark and codes are available at https://github.com/Johanson-colab/SPD-Faith-Bench.

It can be seamlessly integrated with image-based face swapping approaches built on diffusion models. First, we introduce a Frequency Spectrum Attention Interpolation technique to facilitate generation and intact key identity characteristics.

Third, we present a Flow-Guided Attention Temporal Smoothening mechanism that enforces spatiotemporal coherence without modifying the underlying diffusion model to reduce temporal inconsistencies typically encountered in frame-wise generation. Our method requires no additional training or video-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly enhances temporal consistency and visual fidelity, offering a practical and modular solution for video-based face swapping.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07860v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.   In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.   We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial intelligence is crucial for vision--language models (VLMs) in the physical world, yet many benchmarks evaluate largely unconstrained scenes where models can exploit 2D shortcuts. We introduce SSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark for spatial reasoning on constrained manifolds, built from complex real-world 3D structures whose feasible configurations are tightly governed by geometric, topological, and physical constraints. SSI-Bench contains 1,000 ranking questions spanning geometric and topological reasoning and requiring a diverse repertoire of compositional spatial operations, such as mental rotation, cross-sectional inference, occlusion reasoning, and force-path reasoning. It is created via a fully human-centered pipeline: ten researchers spent over 400 hours curating images, annotating structural components, and designing questions to minimize pixel-level cues. Evaluating 31 widely used VLMs reveals a large gap to humans: the best open-source model achieves 22.2% accuracy and the strongest closed-source model reaches 33.6%, while humans score 91.6%. Encouraging models to think yields only marginal gains, and error analysis points to failures in structural grounding and constraint-consistent 3D reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieving wrist radiographs with analogous fracture patterns is challenging because clinically important cues are subtle, highly localized and often obscured by overlapping anatomy or variable imaging views. Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07891v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geometric foundation models show promise in 3D reconstruction, yet their progress is severely constrained by the scarcity of diverse, large-scale 3D annotations. While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a primary approach for deploying large language models without fine-tuning, and the quantized performance is often strongly affected by the calibration in PTQ. By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability. The code will be released publicly.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07931v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are often used for zero-shot detection of visual attributes in the image. We present a zero-shot evaluation of open-source VLMs for privacy-related attribute recognition. We identify the attributes for which VLMs exhibit strong inter-annotator agreement, and discuss the disagreement cases of human and VLM annotations. Our results show that when evaluated against human annotations, VLMs tend to predict the presence of privacy attributes more often than human annotators. In addition to this, we find that in cases of high inter-annotator agreement between VLMs, they can complement human annotation by identifying attributes overlooked by human annotators. This highlights the potential of VLMs to support privacy annotations in large-scale image datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07938v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving scene is a challenging task due to uncertainty in sensor data, the complex behaviors of agents, and the possibility of multiple feasible futures. Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Crowd scenes captured by cameras at different locations vary greatly, and existing crowd models have limited generalization for unseen surveillance scenes. To improve the generalization of the model, we regard different surveillance scenes as different category scenes, and introduce few-shot learning to make the model adapt to the unseen surveillance scene that belongs to the given exemplar category scene. To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way. Experiments on three surveillance datasets shows that proposed method can adapt to the unseen surveillance scene and outperform recent state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot crowd counting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07960v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spoken dialogue is a primary source of information in videos; therefore, accurately identifying who spoke what and when is essential for deep video understanding. We introduce D-ORCA, a \textbf{d}ialogue-centric \textbf{o}mni-modal large language model optimized for \textbf{r}obust audio-visual \textbf{ca}ptioning. We further curate DVD, a large-scale, high-quality bilingual dataset comprising nearly 40,000 multi-party dialogue videos for training and 2000 videos for evaluation in English and Mandarin, addressing a critical gap in the open-source ecosystem. To ensure fine-grained captioning accuracy, we adopt group relative policy optimization with three novel reward functions that assess speaker attribution accuracy, global speech content accuracy, and sentence-level temporal boundary alignment. These rewards are derived from evaluation metrics widely used in speech processing and, to our knowledge, are applied for the first time as reinforcement learning objectives for audio-visual captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ORCA substantially outperforms existing open-source models in speaker identification, speech recognition, and temporal grounding. Notably, despite having only 8 billion parameters, D-ORCA achieves performance competitive with Qwen3-Omni across several general-purpose audio-visual understanding benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07967v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, motion generative models have undergone significant advancement, yet pose challenges in aligning with downstream objectives. Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07979v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spectral computed tomography (CT) with photon-counting detectors holds immense potential for material discrimination and tissue characterization. However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07980v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The clinical application of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is constrained by the inherent trade-off between radiation exposure and image quality. Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology has significantly elevated the realism and accessibility of synthetic media. Emerging techniques, such as diffusion-based models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), alongside enhancements in traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have contributed to the sophisticated generation of deepfake videos. Concurrently, deepfake detection methods have seen notable progress, driven by innovations in Transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and other machine learning approaches. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against cutting-edge synthesis methods. Our findings highlight a concerning trend: many state-of-the-art detection models exhibit markedly poor performance when challenged with deepfakes produced by modern synthesis techniques, including poor performance by human participants against the best quality deepfakes. Through extensive experimentation, we provide evidence that underscores the urgent need for continued refinement of detection models to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of deepfake generation technologies. This research emphasizes the critical gap between current detection methodologies and the sophistication of new generation techniques, calling for intensified efforts in this crucial area of study.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-based image editing have shown remarkable progress. However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving requires forecasting both geometry and semantics over time to effectively reason about future environment states. Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08020v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning-based garment draping has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Physics-Based Simulation (PBS), yet robust collision handling remains a critical bottleneck. Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08024v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in video understanding, they are required to process high volumes of visual tokens, causing significant computational inefficiency. Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The generation and completion of 3D objects represent a transformative challenge in computer vision. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data. However, they often struggle to capture complex and diverse data distributions, particularly in scenarios involving incomplete inputs or significant missing regions. These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MoE-DCGAN in handling complex 3D data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Incorporating symmetry priors as inductive biases to design equivariant Vision Transformers (ViTs) has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing their performance. However, existing equivariant ViTs often struggle to balance performance with equivariance, primarily due to the challenge of achieving holistic equivariant modifications across the diverse modules in ViTs-particularly in harmonizing the Self-Attention mechanism with Patch Embedding. To address this, we propose a straightforward framework that systematically renders key ViT components, including patch embedding, self-attention, positional encodings, and Down/Up-Sampling, equivariant, thereby constructing ViTs with guaranteed equivariance. The resulting architecture serves as a plug-and-play replacement that is both theoretically grounded and practically versatile, scaling seamlessly even to Swin Transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our equivariant ViTs consistently improve performance and data efficiency across a wide spectrum of vision tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To tackle the automatic recognition of "concealed emotions" in videos, this paper proposes a multimodal weak-supervision framework and achieves state-of-the-art results on the iMiGUE tennis-interview dataset. First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark. The study also validates that an "MLP-ified" key-point backbone can match - or even surpass - GCN-based counterparts in this task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08058v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the presence of occlusions and measurement noise, geometrically accurate scene reconstructions -- which fit the sensor data -- can still be physically incorrect. For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The recent proliferation of diffusion models has made style mimicry effortless, enabling users to imitate unique artistic styles without authorization. In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video generation with controllable camera viewpoints is essential for applications such as interactive content creation, gaming, and simulation. Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity. Our results demonstrate that ReRoPE offers a training-efficient path toward controllable, high-fidelity video generation. See project page for more results: https://sisyphe-lee.github.io/ReRoPE/

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into modernizing Vision Transformer backbones by leveraging architectural advancements from the past five years. While preserving the canonical Attention-FFN structure, we conduct a component-wise refinement involving normalization, activation functions, positional encoding, gating mechanisms, and learnable tokens. These updates form a new generation of Vision Transformers, which we call ViT-5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-5 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art plain Vision Transformers across both understanding and generation benchmarks. On ImageNet-1k classification, ViT-5-Base reaches 84.2\% top-1 accuracy under comparable compute, exceeding DeiT-III-Base at 83.8\%. ViT-5 also serves as a stronger backbone for generative modeling: when plugged into an SiT diffusion framework, it achieves 1.84 FID versus 2.06 with a vanilla ViT backbone. Beyond headline metrics, ViT-5 exhibits improved representation learning and favorable spatial reasoning behavior, and transfers reliably across tasks. With a design aligned with contemporary foundation-model practices, ViT-5 offers a simple drop-in upgrade over vanilla ViT for mid-2020s vision backbones.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08099v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies have adapted generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into embedding extractors for vision tasks, typically through fine-tuning to produce universal representations. However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08112v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present MMLSv2, a dataset for landslide segmentation on Martian surfaces. MMLSv2 consists of multimodal imagery with seven bands: RGB, digital elevation model, slope, thermal inertia, and grayscale channels. MMLSv2 comprises 664 images distributed across training, validation, and test splits. In addition, an isolated test set of 276 images from a geographically disjoint region from the base dataset is released to evaluate spatial generalization. Experiments conducted with multiple segmentation models show that the dataset supports stable training and achieves competitive performance, while still posing challenges in fragmented, elongated, and small-scale landslide regions. Evaluation on the isolated test set leads to a noticeable performance drop, indicating increased difficulty and highlighting its value for assessing model robustness and generalization beyond standard in-distribution settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rapid building damage assessment is critical for post-disaster response. Damage classification models built on satellite imagery provide a scalable means of obtaining situational awareness. However, label noise and severe class imbalance in satellite data create major challenges. The xBD dataset offers a standardized benchmark for building-level damage across diverse geographic regions. In this study, we evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) model performance on the xBD dataset, specifically investigating how these models distinguish between types of structural damage when training on noisy, imbalanced data.   In this study, we specifically evaluate DINOv2-small and DeiT for multi-class damage classification. We propose a targeted patch-based pre-processing pipeline to isolate structural features and minimize background noise in training. We adopt a frozen-head fine-tuning strategy to keep computational requirements manageable. Model performance is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-averaged F1 scores. We show that small ViT architectures with our novel training method achieves competitive macro-averaged F1 relative to prior CNN baselines for disaster classification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable 3D object detection is fundamental to autonomous driving, and multimodal fusion algorithms using cameras and LiDAR remain a persistent challenge. Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.

This tutorial presents the Fields of The World (FTW) ecosystem: a benchmark of 1.6M field polygons across 24 countries, pre-trained segmentation models, and command-line inference tools. We provide two notebooks that cover (1) local-scale field boundary extraction with crop classification and forest loss attribution, and (2) country-scale inference using cloud-optimized data. We use MOSAIKS random convolutional features and FTW derived field boundaries to map crop type at the field level and report macro F1 scores of 0.65--0.75 for crop type classification with limited labels. Finally, we show how to explore pre-computed predictions over five countries (4.76M km\textsuperscript{2}), with median predicted field areas from 0.06 ha (Rwanda) to 0.28 ha (Switzerland).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08136v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are now a core part of modern AI. Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation in high-resolution agricultural imagery demands models that strike a careful balance between accuracy and computational efficiency to enable deployment in practical systems. In this work, we propose DAS-SK, a novel lightweight architecture that retrofits selective kernel convolution (SK-Conv) into the dual atrous separable convolution (DAS-Conv) module to strengthen multi-scale feature learning. The model further enhances the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, enabling the capture of fine-grained local structures alongside global contextual information. Built upon a modified DeepLabV3 framework with two complementary backbones - MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNet-B3, the DAS-SK model mitigates limitations associated with large dataset requirements, limited spectral generalization, and the high computational cost that typically restricts deployment on UAVs and other edge devices. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks: LandCover.ai, VDD, and PhenoBench, demonstrate that DAS-SK consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, while being more efficient than CNN-, transformer-, and hybrid-based competitors. Notably, DAS-SK requires up to 21x fewer parameters and 19x fewer GFLOPs than top-performing transformer models. These findings establish DAS-SK as a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for real-time agricultural robotics and high-resolution remote sensing, with strong potential for broader deployment in other vision domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present PEGAsus, a new framework capable of generating Personalized 3D shapes by learning shape concepts at both Geometry and Appearance levels. First, we formulate 3D shape personalization as extracting reusable, category-agnostic geometric and appearance attributes from reference shapes, and composing these attributes with text to generate novel shapes. Second, we design a progressive optimization strategy to learn shape concepts at both the geometry and appearance levels, decoupling the shape concept learning process. Third, we extend our approach to region-wise concept learning, enabling flexible concept extraction, with context-aware and context-free losses. Extensive experimental results show that PEGAsus is able to effectively extract attributes from a wide range of reference shapes and then flexibly compose these concepts with text to synthesize new shapes. This enables fine-grained control over shape generation and supports the creation of diverse, personalized results, even in challenging cross-category scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, qualitative analysis reveals that the generation trajectories of our model exhibit distinct behaviors in cases characterized by high noise or significant physiological variability, thereby offering a novel layer of interpretability for AI-aided diagnosis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising research direction in remote sensing, enabling the recognition of diverse land-cover types beyond pre-defined category sets. However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and GID5 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08211v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a textual description, the task of referring expression comprehension (REC) involves the localisation of the referred object in an image. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved high accuracy on REC benchmarks through scaling up the model size and training data. Moreover, the performance of MLLMs can be further improved using techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and tool use, which provides additional visual or textual context to the model. In this paper, we analyse the effect of various techniques for providing additional visual and textual context via tool use to the MLLM and its effect on the REC task. Furthermore, we propose a training-free framework named Chain-of-Caption to improve the REC performance of MLLMs. We perform experiments on RefCOCO/RefCOCOg/RefCOCO+ and Ref-L4 datasets and show that individual textual or visual context can improve the REC performance without any fine-tuning. By combining multiple contexts, our training-free framework shows between 5% to 30% performance gain over the baseline model on accuracy at various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) shows excellent performance in video object segmentation tasks; however, the heavy computational burden hinders its application in real-time video processing. Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08230v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event cameras have been widely adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and human-computer interaction. A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \textbf{M}otion-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08262v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive brain disorder classification by capturing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines. Our findings advocate for a shift toward end-to-end temporal modeling in fMRI analysis to better capture complex brain dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/DeCI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The landscape of AI video generation is undergoing a pivotal shift: moving beyond general generation - which relies on exhaustive prompt-engineering and "cherry-picking" - towards fine-grained, controllable generation and high-fidelity post-processing. In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale, cross-species plant distribution prediction plays a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, yet modeling efforts in this area still face significant challenges due to the sparsity and bias of observational data. Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Audio-visual learning suffers from modality misalignment caused by off-screen sources and background clutter, and current methods usually amplify irrelevant regions or moments, leading to unstable training and degraded representation quality. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel Caption-aligned and Agreement-guided Enhancement framework (CAE-AV) for audio-visual learning, which used two complementary modules: Cross-modal Agreement-guided Spatio-Temporal Enrichment (CASTE) and Caption-Aligned Saliency-guided Enrichment (CASE) to relieve audio-visual misalignment. CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment. CASE injects cross-modal semantic guidance into selected spatio-temporal positions, leveraging high-level semantic cues to further alleviate misalignment. In addition, we design lightweight objectives, caption-to-modality InfoNCE, visual-audio consistency, and entropy regularization to guide token selection and strengthen cross-modal semantic alignment. With frozen backbones, CAE-AV achieves state-of-the-art performance on AVE, AVVP, AVS, and AVQA benchmarks, and qualitative analyses further validate its robustness against audio-visual misalignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08337v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we focus on motion discrete tokenization, which converts raw motion into compact discrete tokens--a process proven crucial for efficient motion generation. In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147. LG-Tok-mini uses only half the tokens while maintaining competitive performance (Top-1: 0.521/0.588, FID: 0.085/0.071), validating the efficiency of our semantic representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08342v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning transferable multimodal embeddings for urban environments is challenging because urban understanding is inherently spatial, yet existing datasets and benchmarks lack explicit alignment between street-view images and urban structure. We introduce UGData, a spatially grounded dataset that anchors street-view images to structured spatial graphs and provides graph-aligned supervision via spatial reasoning paths and spatial context captions, exposing distance, directionality, connectivity, and neighborhood context beyond image content. Building on UGData, we propose UGE, a two-stage training strategy that progressively and stably aligns images, text, and spatial structures by combining instruction-guided contrastive learning with graph-based spatial encoding. We finally introduce UGBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate how spatially grounded embeddings support diverse urban understanding tasks -- including geolocation ranking, image retrieval, urban perception, and spatial grounding. We develop UGE on multiple state-of-the-art VLM backbones, including Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-3-Vision, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral, and train fixed-dimensional spatial embeddings with LoRA tuning. UGE built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone achieves up to 44% improvement in image retrieval and 30% in geolocation ranking on training cities, and over 30% and 22% gains respectively on held-out cities, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit spatial grounding for spatially intensive urban tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has demonstrated excellent abilities in various visual tasks. Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing. However, this paradigm introduces significant challenges as diverse errors may occur during reasoning processes. This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement. (2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and establish crucial foundations for advancing PRMs in LVLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08355v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: E-commerce short videos represent a high-revenue segment of the online video industry characterized by a goal-driven format and dense multi-modal signals. Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a \textbf{multi-modal information density assessment framework} to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds)}, which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&amp;A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop \textbf{E-VAds-R1}, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called \textbf{MG-GRPO}. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image editing. However, challenges persist in handling geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, particularly in complex scenes. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations: (1) difficulty in achieving accurate geometric editing of object translation, rotation, and scaling; (2) inadequate modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects, leading to unrealistic results. To address these issues, we propose GeoEdit, a framework that leverages in-context generation through a diffusion transformer module, which integrates geometric transformations for precise object edits. Moreover, we introduce Effects-Sensitive Attention, which enhances the modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects for improved realism. To further support training, we construct RS-Objects, a large-scale geometric editing dataset containing over 120,000 high-quality image pairs, enabling the model to learn precise geometric editing while generating realistic lighting and shadows. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that GeoEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, geometric accuracy, and realism.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08395v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of diffusion priors with temporal alignment has emerged as a transformative paradigm for video restoration, delivering fantastic perceptual quality, yet the practical deployment of such frameworks is severely constrained by prohibitive inference latency and temporal instability when confronted with complex real-world degradations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{D$^2$-VR}, a single-image diffusion-based video-restoration framework with low-step inference. To obtain precise temporal guidance under severe degradation, we first design a Degradation-Robust Flow Alignment (DRFA) module that leverages confidence-aware attention to filter unreliable motion cues. We then incorporate an adversarial distillation paradigm to compress the diffusion sampling trajectory into a rapid few-step regime. Finally, a synergistic optimization strategy is devised to harmonize perceptual quality with rigorous temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D$^2$-VR achieves state-of-the-art performance while accelerating the sampling process by \textbf{12$\times$}

However, the development of robust methods is limited by the scarcity of large-scale ground truth data. We propose RealSynCol, a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to replicate the endoscopic environment. Colon geometries extracted from 10 CT scans were imported into a virtual environment that closely mimics intraoperative conditions and rendered with realistic vascular textures. The resulting dataset comprises 28\,130 frames, paired with ground truth depth maps, optical flow, 3D meshes, and camera trajectories. A benchmark study was conducted to evaluate the available synthetic colon datasets for the tasks of depth and pose estimation. Results demonstrate that the high realism and variability of RealSynCol significantly enhance generalization performance on clinical images, proving it to be a powerful tool for developing deep learning algorithms to support endoscopic diagnosis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We revisit the problem of training attention-based sparse image matching models for various local features. We first identify one critical design choice that has been previously overlooked, which significantly impacts the performance of the LightGlue model. We then investigate the role of detectors and descriptors within the transformer-based matching framework, finding that detectors, rather than descriptors, are often the primary cause for performance difference. Finally, we propose a novel approach to fine-tune existing image matching models using keypoints from a diverse set of detectors, resulting in a universal, detector-agnostic model. When deployed as a zero-shot matcher for novel detectors, the resulting model achieves or exceeds the accuracy of models specifically trained for those features. Our findings offer valuable insights for the deployment of transformer-based matching models and the future design of local features.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the growing video understanding capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing video benchmarks primarily assess understanding based on models' static, internal knowledge, rather than their ability to learn and adapt from dynamic, novel contexts from few examples. To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Streaming video question answering (Streaming Video QA) poses distinct challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as video frames arrive sequentially and user queries can be issued at arbitrary time points. Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, a rapidly evolving field in computer vision, aims to produce realistic and text-aligned motion sequences. Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences. Code is available at: https://caoyiyang1105.github.io/TriC-Motion/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08479v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gestures are a key component of non-verbal communication in traffic, often helping pedestrian-to-driver interactions when formal traffic rules may be insufficient. This problem becomes more apparent when autonomous vehicles (AVs) struggle to interpret such gestures. In this study, we present a gesture classification framework using 2D pose estimation applied to real-world video sequences from the WIVW dataset. We categorise gestures into four primary classes (Stop, Go, Thank & Greet, and No Gesture) and extract 76 static and dynamic features from normalised keypoints. Our analysis demonstrates that hand position and movement velocity are especially discriminative in distinguishing between gesture classes, achieving a classification accuracy score of 87%. These findings not only improve the perceptual capabilities of AV systems but also contribute to the broader understanding of pedestrian behaviour in traffic contexts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08491v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual food recognition systems deployed in real-world environments, such as automated conveyor-belt inspection, are highly sensitive to domain shifts caused by illumination changes. While recent studies have shown that lighting variations can significantly distort food perception by both humans and AI, existing works are often limited to single food categories or controlled settings, and most public food datasets lack explicit illumination annotations.   In this work, we investigate illumination-induced domain shift in multi-class food category recognition using two widely adopted datasets, Food-101 and Fruits-360. We demonstrate substantial accuracy degradation under cross-dataset evaluation due to mismatched visual conditions. To address this challenge, we construct synthetic illumination-augmented datasets by systematically varying light temperature and intensity, enabling controlled robustness analysis without additional labels.   We further evaluate cross-dataset transfer learning and domain generalization, with a focus on illumination-sensitive target categories such as apple-based classes. Experimental results show that illumination-aware augmentation significantly improves recognition robustness under domain shift while preserving real-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of illumination robustness and provide practical insights for deploying reliable food recognition systems in real-world inspection scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08503v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-correction is essential for solving complex reasoning problems in vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to learn it, as effective self-correction behaviors emerge only rarely, making learning signals extremely sparse. To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability. Across 7 benchmarks, it achieves SoTA performance among open-source VLMs, outperforming the best RLVR baseline by 1.0 score while requiring only $0.72\times$ training time per step.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08505v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although vision foundation models (VFMs) are increasingly reused for biomedical image analysis, it remains unclear whether the latent representations they provide are general enough to support effective transfer and reuse across heterogeneous microscopy image datasets. Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fr\'echet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geometry problem-solving remains a significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), requiring not only global shape recognition but also attention to intricate local relationships related to geometric theory. To address this, we propose GeoFocus, a novel framework comprising two core modules. 1) Critical Local Perceptor, which automatically identifies and emphasizes critical local structure (e.g., angles, parallel lines, comparative distances) through thirteen theory-based perception templates, boosting critical local feature coverage by 61% compared to previous methods. 2) VertexLang, a compact topology formal language, encodes global figures through vertex coordinates and connectivity relations. By replacing bulky code-based encodings, VertexLang reduces global perception training time by 20% while improving topology recognition accuracy. When evaluated in Geo3K, GeoQA, and FormalGeo7K, GeoFocus achieves a 4.7% accuracy improvement over leading specialized models and demonstrates superior robustness in MATHVERSE under diverse visual conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image reconstruction in X-ray tomography is an ill-posed inverse problem, particularly with limited available data. Regularization is thus essential, but its effectiveness hinges on the choice of a regularization parameter that balances data fidelity against a priori information. We present a novel method for automatic parameter selection based on the use of two distinct computational discretizations of the same problem. A feedback control algorithm dynamically adjusts the regularization strength, driving an iterative reconstruction toward the smallest parameter that yields sufficient similarity between reconstructions on the two grids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using real tomographic data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thermal imaging provides a practical sensing modality for visual SLAM in visually degraded environments such as low illumination, smoke, or adverse weather. However, thermal imagery often exhibits low texture, low contrast, and high noise, complicating feature-based SLAM. In this work, we propose a sparse monocular graph-based SLAM system for thermal imagery that leverages general-purpose learned features -- the SuperPoint detector and LightGlue matcher, trained on large-scale visible-spectrum data to improve cross-domain generalization. To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches. We further incorporate keypoint confidence scores from SuperPoint into a confidence-weighted factor graph to improve estimation robustness. Evaluations on public thermal datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable performance without requiring dataset-specific training or fine-tuning a desired feature detector, given the scarcity of quality thermal data. Code will be made available upon publication.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08540v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object-level segmentation in dynamic 4D Gaussian scenes remains challenging due to complex motion, occlusions, and ambiguous boundaries. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08558v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce FLAG-4D, a novel framework for generating novel views of dynamic scenes by reconstructing how 3D Gaussian primitives evolve through space and time. Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Photorealistic color retouching plays a vital role in visual content creation, yet manual retouching remains inaccessible to non-experts due to its reliance on specialized expertise. Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08613v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Point cloud is a prevalent 3D data representation format with significant application values in immersive media, autonomous driving, digital heritage protection, etc. However, the large data size of point clouds poses challenges to transmission and storage, which influences the wide deployments. Therefore, point cloud compression plays a crucial role in practical applications for both human and machine perception optimization. To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC). In the meantime, the Audio Video coding Standard (AVS) Workgroup of China also have launched and completed the development for its first generation point cloud compression standard, namely AVS PCC. This new standardization effort has adopted many new coding tools and techniques, which are different from the other counterpart standards. This paper reviews the AVS PCC standard from two perspectives, i.e., the related technologies and performance comparisons.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08615v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While generative models have become powerful tools for image synthesis, they are typically optimized for executing carefully crafted textual prompts, offering limited support for the open-ended visual exploration that often precedes idea formation. In contrast, designers frequently draw inspiration from loosely connected visual references, seeking emergent connections that spark new ideas. We propose Inspiration Seeds, a generative framework that shifts image generation from final execution to exploratory ideation. Given two input images, our model produces diverse, visually coherent compositions that reveal latent relationships between inputs, without relying on user-specified text prompts. Our approach is feed-forward, trained on synthetic triplets of decomposed visual aspects derived entirely through visual means: we use CLIP Sparse Autoencoders to extract editing directions in CLIP latent space and isolate concept pairs. By removing the reliance on language and enabling fast, intuitive recombination, our method supports visual ideation at the early and ambiguous stages of creative work.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08620v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work leverages Vision Foundation Models as image encoders to boost the generative performance of latent diffusion models (LDMs), as their semantic feature distributions are easy to learn. However, such semantic features often lack low-level information (\eg, color and texture), leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity, which has emerged as a primary bottleneck in further scaling LDMs. To address this limitation, we propose LV-RAE, a representation autoencoder that augments semantic features with missing low-level information, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction while remaining highly aligned with the semantic distribution. We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/modyu-liu/LVRAE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Transformers have emerged as powerful, scalable and versatile representation learners. To capture both global and local features, a learnable [CLS] class token is typically prepended to the input sequence of patch tokens. Despite their distinct nature, both token types are processed identically throughout the model. In this work, we investigate the friction between global and local feature learning under different pre-training strategies by analyzing the interactions between class and patch tokens. Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy. The proposed modifications introduce only an 8% increase in parameters, with no additional computational overhead. Through comprehensive ablations, we provide insights into which architectural components benefit most from specialization and how our approach generalizes across model scales and learning frameworks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08652v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate annotation of fixation type is a critical step in slide preparation for pathology laboratories. However, this manual process is prone to   errors, impacting downstream analyses and diagnostic accuracy. Existing methods for verifying formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and frozen   section (FS) fixation types typically require full-resolution whole-slide images (WSIs), limiting scalability for high-throughput quality control.   We propose a deep-learning model to predict fixation types using low-resolution, pre-scan thumbnail images. The model was trained on WSIs from   the TUM Institute of Pathology (n=1,200, Leica GT450DX) and evaluated on a class-balanced subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA, n=8,800,   Leica AT2), as well as on class-balanced datasets from Augsburg (n=695 [392 FFPE, 303 FS], Philips UFS) and Regensburg (n=202, 3DHISTECH P1000).   Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.88 on TCGA, outperforming comparable pre-scan methods by 4.8%. It also achieves AUROCs of 0.72 on Regensburg and   Augsburg slides, underscoring challenges related to scanner-induced domain shifts. Furthermore, the model processes each slide in 21 ms, $400\times$   faster than existing high-magnification, full-resolution methods, enabling rapid, high-throughput processing.   This approach provides an efficient solution for detecting labelling errors without relying on high-magnification scans, offering a valuable tool for   quality control in high-throughput pathology workflows. Future work will improve and evaluate the model's generalisation to additional scanner   types. Our findings suggest that this method can increase accuracy and efficiency in digital pathology workflows and may be extended to other   low-resolution slide annotations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human pose estimation is fundamental to intelligent perception in the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling applications ranging from smart healthcare to human-computer interaction. While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08670v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning methods have been successful in many areas, like image classification and natural language processing. However, it still needs to be determined how to apply ML to areas with mathematical constraints, like solving PDEs. Among various approaches to applying ML techniques to solving PDEs, the data-driven discretization method presents a promising way of accelerating and improving existing PDE solver on structured grids where it predicts the coefficients of quasi-linear stencils for computing values or derivatives of a function at given positions. It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework. Experiments show that our classic solver performs much better than the Pyclaw solver. Then we propose four different deep neural networks for the ML-based solver. The results indicate that two of these approaches could output satisfactory solutions.

In this paper, we present ALIVE, a generation model that adapts a pretrained Text-to-Video (T2V) model to Sora-style audio-video generation and animation. In particular, the model unlocks the Text-to-Video&amp;Audio (T2VA) and Reference-to-Video&amp;Audio (animation) capabilities compared to the T2V foundation models. To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. With detailed recipes and benchmarks, we hope ALIVE helps the community develop audio-video generation models more efficiently. Official page: https://github.com/FoundationVision/Alive.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08683v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.   Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.   Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08699v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) seeks to restore dynamic or static scenes plagued by severe invisibility and noise. In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08711v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes Omni Dense Captioning, a novel task designed to generate continuous, fine-grained, and structured audio-visual narratives with explicit timestamps. To ensure dense semantic coverage, we introduce a six-dimensional structural schema to create "script-like" captions, enabling readers to vividly imagine the video content scene by scene, akin to a cinematographic screenplay. To facilitate research, we construct OmniDCBench, a high-quality, human-annotated benchmark, and propose SodaM, a unified metric that evaluates time-aware detailed descriptions while mitigating scene boundary ambiguity. Furthermore, we construct a training dataset, TimeChatCap-42K, and present TimeChat-Captioner-7B, a strong baseline trained via SFT and GRPO with task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeChat-Captioner-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro, while its generated dense descriptions significantly boost downstream capabilities in audio-visual reasoning (DailyOmni and WorldSense) and temporal grounding (Charades-STA). All datasets, models, and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yaolinli/TimeChat-Captioner.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08713v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on a wide range of tasks by pairing a vision encoder with a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned for visual-text inputs. Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to "see". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08717v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable identification of anatomical body regions is a prerequisite for many automated medical imaging workflows, yet existing solutions remain heavily dependent on unreliable DICOM metadata. Current solutions mainly use supervised learning, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether body region detection in volumetric CT and MR images can be achieved in a fully zero-shot manner by using knowledge embedded in large pre-trained foundation models. We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage. The MLLM performs competitively in visually distinctive regions, while the segmentation-aware MLLM reveals fundamental limitations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08724v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to decompose a scene into its geometry, material properties and light conditions under a certain rendering model. It has wide applications like view synthesis, relighting, and scene editing. In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-guided image editing aims to modify specific regions according to the target prompt while preserving the identity of the source image. Recent methods exploit explicit binary masks to constrain editing, but hard mask boundaries introduce artifacts and reduce editability. To address these issues, we propose FusionEdit, a training-free image editing framework that achieves precise and controllable edits. First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results. Second, FusionEdit leverages AdaIN-based modulation within DiT attention layers to perform a statistical attention fusion in the editing region, enhancing editability while preserving global consistency with the source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FusionEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08726v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The study of eye movements, particularly saccades and fixations, are fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of human cognition and perception. Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08727v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Undersampled CT volumes minimize acquisition time and radiation exposure but introduce artifacts degrading image quality and diagnostic utility. Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead. This hybrid framework presents a robust and efficient solution for high-quality 3D CT image post-processing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08730v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) tackles the problem of adapting a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without accessing any source data, which is quite suitable for the field of data security. Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08735v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in single-image spatial reasoning, multi-image spatial reasoning, which requires integration of information from multiple viewpoints, remains challenging. Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow matching models have recently emerged as an efficient alternative to diffusion, especially for text-guided image generation and editing, offering faster inference through continuous-time dynamics. However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08753v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The demand for realistic and versatile character animation has surged, driven by its wide-ranging applications in various domains. However, the animation generation algorithms modeling human pose with 2D or 3D structures all face various problems, including low-quality output content and training data deficiency, preventing the related algorithms from generating high-quality animation videos. Therefore, we introduce MVAnimate, a novel framework that synthesizes both 2D and 3D information of dynamic figures based on multi-view prior information, to enhance the generated video quality. Our approach leverages multi-view prior information to produce temporally consistent and spatially coherent animation outputs, demonstrating improvements over existing animation methods. Our MVAnimate also optimizes the multi-view videos of the target character, enhancing the video quality from different views. Experimental results on diverse datasets highlight the robustness of our method in handling various motion patterns and appearances.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Talking-head avatars are increasingly adopted in educational technology to deliver content with social presence and improved engagement. However, many recent talking-head generation (THG) methods rely on GPU-centric neural rendering, large training sets, or high-capacity diffusion models, which limits deployment in offline or resource-constrained learning environments. A deterministic and CPU-oriented THG framework is described, termed Symbolic Vedic Computation, that converts speech to a time-aligned phoneme stream, maps phonemes to a compact viseme inventory, and produces smooth viseme trajectories through symbolic coarticulation inspired by Vedic sutra Urdhva Tiryakbhyam. A lightweight 2D renderer performs region-of-interest (ROI) warping and mouth compositing with stabilization to support real-time synthesis on commodity CPUs. Experiments report synchronization accuracy, temporal stability, and identity consistency under CPU-only execution, alongside benchmarking against representative CPU-feasible baselines. Results indicate that acceptable lip-sync quality can be achieved while substantially reducing computational load and latency, supporting practical educational avatars on low-end hardware.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The pantograph-catenary interface is essential for ensuring uninterrupted and reliable power delivery in electrified rail systems. However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations.

Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster a vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08797v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is limited by expensive annotations and data heterogeneity across scanners and sites. We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed. These results show that confidence-driven curricula and selective unlearning provide robust segmentation under limited supervision and noisy pseudo-labels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Omni-Video 2, a scalable and computationally efficient model that connects pretrained multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) with video diffusion models for unified video generation and editing. Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation. The results demonstrate its superior ability to follow complex compositional instructions in video editing, while also achieving competitive or superior quality in video generation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08822v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT), but practical constraints, such as patient discomfort, long scan times, and high costs often lead to incomplete modalities in clinical practice, compromising RT planning accuracy. Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08828v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing capability of video generation poses escalating security risks, making reliable detection increasingly essential. In this paper, we introduce VideoVeritas, a framework that integrates fine-grained perception and fact-based reasoning. We observe that while current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capacity, their granular perception ability remains limited. To mitigate this, we introduce Joint Preference Alignment and Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning (PPRL). Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods tend to bias towards either superficial reasoning or mechanical analysis, while VideoVeritas achieves more balanced performance across diverse benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08858v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works have indicated redundancy across transformer blocks, prompting the research of depth compression to prune less crucial blocks. However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\%. It also outperforms other pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference, making it promising for enhancing the efficiency of transformers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Video Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Video MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in video-language tasks such as video understanding and question answering. However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08909v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate what structure emerges in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) solutions from standard multi-view optimization. We term these Rendering-Optimal References (RORs) and analyze their statistical properties, revealing stable patterns: mixture-structured scales and bimodal radiance across diverse scenes. To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08958v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling the time-varying 3D appearance of plants during their growth poses unique challenges: unlike many dynamic scenes, plants generate new geometry over time as they expand, branch, and differentiate. Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08961v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce MotionCrafter, a video diffusion-based framework that jointly reconstructs 4D geometry and estimates dense motion from a monocular video. The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08962v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately predicting pedestrian motion is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving in complex urban environments. In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08996v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While there is rapid progress in video-LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities, prior work shows that these models struggle on the challenging task of sports feedback generation and require expensive and difficult-to-collect finetuning feedback data for each sport. This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability. Together, our approach enables more meaningful and practical generation of sports feedback under limited annotations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generation quality, but they suffer from significant inference cost due to their reliance on multiple sequential denoising steps, motivating recent efforts to distill this inference process into a few-step regime. However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing a structured vector-graphics representation from a rasterized floorplan image is typically an important prerequisite for computational tasks involving floorplans such as automated understanding or CAD workflows. However, existing techniques struggle in faithfully generating the structure and semantics conveyed by complex floorplans that depict large indoor spaces with many rooms and a varying numbers of polygon corners. To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as Structure3D, CubiCasa5K, and Raster2Graph, while also demonstrating strong generalization to more challenging datasets like WAFFLE, which contain diverse room structures and complex geometric variations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents WorldCompass, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training framework for the long-horizon, interactive video-based world models, enabling them to explore the world more accurately and consistently based on interaction signals. To effectively "steer" the world model's exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at a single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interaction-following accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09024v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper challenges the dominance of continuous pipelines in visual generation. We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers achieve strong language modeling accuracy, yet their position-wise feed-forward networks (FFNs) are dense, globally shared, and typically updated end to end. These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.   We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.   This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07030v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Classical sabermetrics has profoundly shaped baseball analytics by summarizing long histories of play into compact statistics. While these metrics are invaluable for valuation and retrospective analysis, they do not define a generative model of how baseball games unfold pitch by pitch, leaving most existing approaches limited to single-step prediction or post-hoc analysis. In this work, we present Neural Sabermetrics with World Model, a Large Language Model (LLM) based play-by-play world model for baseball. We cast baseball games as long auto-regressive sequences of events and continuously pretrain a single LLM on more than ten years of Major League Baseball (MLB) tracking data, comprising over seven million pitch sequences and approximately three billion tokens. The resulting model is capable of predicting multiple aspects of game evolution within a unified framework. We evaluate our model on both in-distribution regular-season data and out-of-distribution postseason games and compare against strong neural baselines from prior work. Despite using a single backbone model, our approach outperforms the performance of existing baselines, (1) correctly predicting approximately 64% of next pitches within a plate appearance and (2) 78% of batter swing decisions, suggesting that LLMs can serve as effective world models for sports.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07031v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study develops a Lagged Backward-Compatible Physics-Informed Neural Network (LBC-PINN) for simulating and inverting one-dimensional unsaturated soil consolidation under long-term loading. To address the challenges of coupled air and water pressure dissipation across multi-scale time domains, the framework integrates logarithmic time segmentation, lagged compatibility loss enforcement, and segment-wise transfer learning.   In forward analysis, the LBC-PINN with recommended segmentation schemes accurately predicts pore air and pore water pressure evolution. Model predictions are validated against finite element method (FEM) results, with mean absolute errors below 1e-2 for time durations up to 1e10 seconds. A simplified segmentation strategy based on the characteristic air-phase dissipation time improves computational efficiency while preserving predictive accuracy. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of the framework across air-to-water permeability ratios ranging from 1e-3 to 1e3.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07033v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The lack of real-world data in clinical fields poses a major obstacle in training effective AI models for diagnostic and preventive tools in medicine. Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset. These findings highlight the potential of TransConv-DDPM to generate high-quality synthetic data for real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07054v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings. By providing both a rigorous benchmark and a robust optimization framework, this work enables principled evaluation and improvement of MLLMs for emotion understanding and social AI. Code, models and benchmark will be released at https://avere-iclr.github.io.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present TACIT (Transformation-Aware Capturing of Implicit Thought), a diffusion-based transformer for interpretable visual reasoning. Unlike language-based reasoning systems, TACIT operates entirely in pixel space using rectified flow, enabling direct visualization of the reasoning process at each inference step. We demonstrate the approach on maze-solving, where the model learns to transform images of unsolved mazes into solutions. Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:   - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs   - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth   - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)   Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process. Most remarkably, 100% of samples exhibit simultaneous emergence across all spatial regions, ruling out sequential path construction and providing evidence for holistic rather than algorithmic reasoning. This "eureka moment" pattern -- long incubation followed by sudden crystallization -- parallels insight phenomena in human cognition. The pixel-space design with noise-free flow matching provides a foundation for understanding how neural networks develop implicit reasoning strategies that operate below and before language.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07063v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the volume of video content on the internet grows rapidly, finding a suitable soundtrack remains a significant challenge. This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called "boundary offset encodings," aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator. User studies show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of music richness, emotional alignment, temporal synchronization, and overall preference, setting a new state-of-the-art in video-based music generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07070v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard Transformer architectures rely heavily on dense linear transformations, treating feature projection as a monolithic, full-rank operation. We argue that this formulation is inefficient and lacks the structural inductive bias necessary for distinguishing between local feature preservation and global context integration. To address this, we introduce the Hybrid Dual-Path Linear (HDPL) operator, which decomposes the affine transformation into two topologically distinct pathways: a sparse block-diagonal component for high-rank local processing, and a low-rank Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck for global context regularization. By "surgically" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu dataset demonstrate that the HDPL architecture outperforms a standard Llama-style baseline, reducing validation loss while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 6.8%. Beyond immediate performance gains, we discuss how the explicit materialization of a probabilistic latent space within the Transformer backbone serves as a vital architectural affordance, offering new pathways for inference-time or hypernetwork induced control, continual adaptation, interpretability, and cross-model or cross-modal synchronization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07078v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from training collapse in long-horizon tasks due to exploding gradient variance. To mitigate this, a baseline is commonly introduced for advantage computation; however, traditional value models remain difficult to optimize, and standard group-based baselines overlook sequence heterogeneity. Although classic optimal baseline theory can achieve global variance reduction, it neglects token heterogeneity and requires prohibitive gradient-based computation. In this work, we derive the Optimal Token Baseline (OTB) from first principles, proving that gradient updates should be weighted inversely to their cumulative gradient norm. To ensure efficiency, we propose the Logit-Gradient Proxy that approximates the gradient norm using only forward-pass probabilities. Our method achieves training stability and matches the performance of large group sizes ($N=32$) with only $N=4$, reducing token consumption by over 65% across single-turn and tool-integrated reasoning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis with applications in disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-guided interventions. Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets. The proposed method maintains a favorable balance between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications. A comprehensive evaluation using normalized cross-correlation (NCC), mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), Jacobian determinant, and target registration error (TRE) indicates that attention-guided registration improves alignment accuracy while ensuring anatomically plausible deformations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic tabular data has gained attention for enabling privacy-preserving data sharing. While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity.   To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Loss landscapes are a powerful tool for understanding neural network optimization and generalization, yet traditional low-dimensional analyses often miss complex topological features. We present Landscaper, an open-source Python package for arbitrary-dimensional loss landscape analysis. Landscaper combines Hessian-based subspace construction with topological data analysis to reveal geometric structures such as basin hierarchy and connectivity. A key component is the Saddle-Minimum Average Distance (SMAD) for quantifying landscape smoothness. We demonstrate Landscaper's effectiveness across various architectures and tasks, including those involving pre-trained language models, showing that SMAD captures training transitions, such as landscape simplification, that conventional metrics miss. We also illustrate Landscaper's performance in challenging chemical property prediction tasks, where SMAD can serve as a metric for out-of-distribution generalization, offering valuable insights for model diagnostics and architecture design in data-scarce scientific machine learning scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07141v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces provide a foundational framework for kernel-based learning, where regularization and interpolation problems admit finite-dimensional solutions through classical representer theorems. Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular technique for sample-efficient optimization of black-box functions. In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has non-convex loss landscape and its optimization dynamics is hard to analyze or control. Nevertheless, the dynamics can be empirically convex-like across various tasks, models, optimizers, hyperparameters, etc. In this work, we examine the applicability of convexity and Lipschitz continuity in deep learning, in order to precisely control the loss dynamics via the learning rate schedules. We illustrate that deep learning quickly becomes weakly convex after a short period of training, and the loss is predicable by an upper bound on the last iterate, which further informs the scaling of optimal learning rate. Through the lens of convexity, we build scaling laws of learning rates and losses that extrapolate as much as 80X across training horizons and 70X across model sizes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07150v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic systems are evaluated on benchmarks where agents interact with environments to solve tasks. Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07154v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pooling heterogeneous datasets across domains is a common strategy in representation learning, but naive pooling can amplify distributional asymmetries and yield biased estimators, especially in settings where zero-shot generalization is required. We propose a matching framework that selects samples relative to an adaptive centroid and iteratively refines the representation distribution. The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings. Most importantly, we show that these improvements translate to zero-shot medical anomaly detection, one of the extreme forms of data heterogeneity and asymmetry.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07156v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mimetic initialization uses pretrained models as case studies of good initialization, using observations of structures in trained weights to inspire new, simple initialization techniques. So far, it has been applied only to spatial mixing layers, such convolutional, self-attention, and state space layers. In this work, we present the first attempt to apply the method to channel mixing layers, namely multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Our extremely simple technique for MLPs -- to give the first layer a nonzero mean -- speeds up training on small-scale vision tasks like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k. Though its effect is much smaller than spatial mixing initializations, it can be used in conjunction with them for an additional positive effect.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs have shown strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities, but have not yet been extended to signal processing systems. Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines. These results demonstrate that ICL can bridge synthetic pretraining and real-world adaptability, opening new directions for data efficient control of physical systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Denoising score matching (DSM) for training diffusion models may suffer from high variance at low noise levels. Target Score Matching (TSM) mitigates this when clean data scores are available, providing a low-variance objective. In many applications clean scores are inaccessible due to the presence of latent variables, leaving only joint signals exposed. We propose Latent Target Score Matching (LTSM), an extension of TSM to leverage joint scores for low-variance supervision of the marginal score. While LTSM is effective at low noise levels, a mixture with DSM ensures robustness across noise scales. Across simulation-based inference tasks, LTSM consistently improves variance, score accuracy, and sample quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Material Networks (DMNs) are structure-preserving, mechanistic machine learning models that embed micromechanical principles into their architectures, enabling strong extrapolation capabilities and significant potential to accelerate multiscale modeling of complex microstructures. A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings clarify key trade-offs between model expressivity and efficiency in structure-preserving material networks and provide practical guidance for their deployment in multiscale material modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved tremendous success on a range of challenging tasks. However, safety concerns remain when these methods are deployed on real-world applications, necessitating risk-aware agents. A common utility for learning such risk-aware agents is the entropic risk measure, but current policy gradient methods optimizing this measure must perform high-variance and numerically unstable updates. As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings. Motivated by theory, we propose risk-sensitive exponential actor-critic (rsEAC), an off-policy model-free approach that incorporates novel procedures to avoid the explicit representation of exponential value functions and their gradients, and optimizes its policy w.r.t the entropic risk measure. We show that rsEAC produces more numerically stable updates compared to existing approaches and reliably learns risk-sensitive policies in challenging risky variants of continuous tasks in MuJoCo.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structural Causal Models (SCM) are a powerful framework for describing complicated dynamics across the natural sciences. A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study online learning in two-player uninformed Markov games, where the opponent's actions and policies are unobserved. In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.   In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\min \{\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\sqrt{LK}\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(\eta C + \sqrt{K/\eta})$ regret bound, where $\eta$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $\eta$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Softmax Loss (SL) is being increasingly adopted for recommender systems (RS) as it has demonstrated better performance, robustness and fairness. Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.   Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances. This helps explain the empirically observed improvements in accuracy and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter in complex reasoning tasks due to their static, parametric knowledge, leading to hallucinations and poor performance in specialized domains like mathematics. This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07216v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The field of neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) trains neural policies to solve NP-hard problems such as the traveling salesperson problem (TSP). We ask whether, beyond producing good tours, a trained TSP solver learns internal representations that transfer to other optimization-relevant objectives, in the spirit of transfer learning from other domains. We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to study neural TSP solvers as transferable encoders for prescriptive what-if decision-support objectives beyond tour construction. Finally, we show that transfer accuracy increases with solver quality across training and model scale, suggesting that training stronger NCO solvers also yields more useful encoders for downstream objectives.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adaptability has been regarded as a central feature in the foundation models, enabling them to effectively acclimate to unseen downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as celebrated LoRA facilitate efficient adaptation of large foundation models using labeled, high-quality and generally scarce task data. To mitigate data scarcity in fine-tuning of foundation models, we propose to leverage task similarity across multiple downstream users. Intuitively, users with similar tasks must be able to assist each other in boosting the effective fine-tuning data size. We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery. We also conduct several natural language experiments with varying task similarity, which further demonstrate that when trained together with similar tasks, individual performances are significantly boosted.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the approximation of the median of $d$ inputs using ReLU neural networks. We present depth-width tradeoffs under several settings, culminating in a constant-depth, linear-width construction that achieves exponentially small approximation error with respect to the uniform distribution over the unit hypercube. By further establishing a general reduction from the maximum to the median, our results break a barrier suggested by prior work on the maximum function, which indicated that linear width should require depth growing at least as $\log\log d$ to achieve comparable accuracy. Our construction relies on a multi-stage procedure that iteratively eliminates non-central elements while preserving a candidate set around the median. We overcome obstacles that do not arise for the maximum to yield approximation results that are strictly stronger than those previously known for the maximum itself.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-context large language model (LLM) inference has become the norm for today's AI applications. However, it is severely bottlenecked by the increasing memory demands of its KV cache. Previous works have shown that self-speculative decoding with sparse attention, where tokens are drafted using a subset of the KV cache and verified in parallel with full KV cache, speeds up inference in a lossless way. However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification. In this paper, we propose SpecAttn, a self-speculative decoding method with verification-guided sparse attention. SpecAttn identifies critical KV entries as a byproduct of verification and only loads these entries when drafting subsequent tokens. This not only improves draft token acceptance rate but also incurs low KV selection overhead, thereby improving decoding throughput. SpecAttn achieves 2.81$\times$ higher throughput over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and 1.29$\times$ improvement over state-of-the-art sparsity-based self-speculative decoding methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the era of Model-as-a-Service, organizations increasingly rely on third-party AI models for rapid deployment. However, the dynamic nature of emerging AI applications, the continual introduction of new datasets, and the growing number of models claiming superior performance make efficient and reliable validation of model services increasingly challenging. This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\varepsilon}$. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework provides comprehensive and actionable insights into estimator behavior.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07227v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic policies deployed in real-world environments often encounter post-training faults, where retraining, exploration, or system identification are impractical. We introduce an inference-time, cerebellar-inspired residual control framework that augments a frozen reinforcement learning policy with online corrective actions, enabling fault recovery without modifying base policy parameters. The framework instantiates core cerebellar principles, including high-dimensional pattern separation via fixed feature expansion, parallel microzone-style residual pathways, and local error-driven plasticity with excitatory and inhibitory eligibility traces operating at distinct time scales. These mechanisms enable fast, localized correction under post-training disturbances while avoiding destabilizing global policy updates. A conservative, performance-driven meta-adaptation regulates residual authority and plasticity, preserving nominal behavior and suppressing unnecessary intervention. Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks under actuator, dynamic, and environmental perturbations show improvements of up to $+66\%$ on \texttt{HalfCheetah-v5} and $+53\%$ on \texttt{Humanoid-v5} under moderate faults, with graceful degradation under severe shifts and complementary robustness from consolidating persistent residual corrections into policy parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07235v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Watermarking is an important tool for promoting the responsible use of language models (LMs). Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy. Our work demonstrates that LM watermarking is fundamentally a channel coding problem, paving the way for principled coding-theoretic approaches to watermark design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: High-dimensional genomic data exhibit strong group correlation structures that challenge conventional feature selection methods, which often assume feature independence or rely on pre-defined pathways and are sensitive to outliers and model misspecification.   Methods: We propose the Dorfman screening framework, a multi-stage procedure that forms data-driven variable groups via hierarchical clustering, performs group and within-group hypothesis testing, and refines selection using elastic net or adaptive elastic net. Robust variants incorporate OGK-based covariance estimation, rank-based correlation, and Huber-weighted regression to handle contaminated and non-normal data.   Results: In simulations, Dorfman-Sparse-Adaptive-EN performed best under normal conditions, while Robust-OGK-Dorfman-Adaptive-EN showed clear advantages under data contamination, outperforming classical Dorfman and competing methods. Applied to NSCLC gene expression data for trametinib response, robust Dorfman methods achieved the lowest prediction errors and enriched recovery of clinically relevant genes.   Conclusions: The Dorfman framework provides an efficient and robust approach to genomic feature selection. Robust-OGK-Dorfman-Adaptive-EN offers strong performance under both ideal and contaminated conditions and scales to ultra-high-dimensional settings, making it well suited for modern genomic biomarker discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07263v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) becomes the standard approach for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), shared clusters increasingly execute many concurrent LoRA training jobs over the same frozen backbone. While recent advances enable batching (co-locating) multiple adapters during serving, efficient training-time co-location of heterogeneous LoRA adapters presents unique challenges. Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and na\"ive batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters. At the scheduling layer, tLoRA incorporates an online, residual-capacity-aware scheduler that adaptively groups jobs to maximize collective throughput. Evaluations using real-world cluster traces demonstrate that tLoRA improves training throughput by 1.2--1.8x, job training completion time by 2.3--5.4x, and GPU utilization by 37%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07265v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly used to efficiently scale large language models. However, in production inference, request batching and speculative decoding significantly amplify expert activation, eroding these efficiency benefits. We address this issue by modeling batch-aware expert selection as a modular optimization problem and designing efficient greedy algorithms for different deployment settings. The proposed method, namely XShare, requires no retraining and dynamically adapts to each batch by maximizing the total gating score of selected experts. It reduces expert activation by up to 30% under standard batching, cuts peak GPU load by up to 3x in expert-parallel deployments, and achieves up to 14% throughput gains in speculative decoding via hierarchical, correlation-aware expert selection even if requests in a batch drawn from heterogeneous datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Immersive applications such as virtual and augmented reality impose stringent requirements on frame rate, latency, and synchronization between physical and virtual environments. To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Oversmoothing is a fundamental limitation of deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs), causing node representations to collapse as depth increases. While many prior approaches mitigate this effect through architectural modifications or residual mechanisms, the underlying spectral cause of oversmoothing is often left implicit. We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved. Our results show that oversmoothing is a depth-dependent spectral phenomenon that can be systematically delayed through modest, low-rank adaptation of the graph propagation operator.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative analysis across parties holding complementary feature views of the same samples, yet existing approaches are largely restricted to distributed variants of $k$-means, requiring centralized coordination or the exchange of feature-dependent numerical statistics, and exhibiting limited robustness under heterogeneous views or adversarial behavior. We introduce VertCoHiRF, a fully decentralized framework for vertical federated clustering based on structural consensus across heterogeneous views, allowing each agent to apply a base clustering method adapted to its local feature space in a peer-to-peer manner. Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Binary classification based on predicted probabilities (scores) is a fundamental task in supervised machine learning. While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership. Finally, since sufficiency and separation are generally incompatible, we identify the classifier that minimizes deviation from separation subject to sufficiency, and show that it can also be obtained by our algorithm, often achieving performance comparable to the optimum.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07320v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flat regions of the neural network loss landscape have long been hypothesized to correlate with better generalization properties. A closely related but distinct problem is training models that are robust to internal perturbations to their weights, which may be an important need for future low-power hardware platforms. In this paper, we explore the usage of two methods, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and random-weight perturbation (RWP), to find minima robust to a variety of random corruptions to weights. We consider the problem from two angles: generalization (how do we reduce the noise-robust generalization gap) and optimization (how do we maximize performance from optimizers when subject to strong perturbations). First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP. Lastly, we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength to match the evolution of the loss landscape improves optimizing for these perturbed objectives.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models remains brittle under domain shift and noisy preference supervision. Most existing robust alignment methods focus on uncertainty in alignment data, while overlooking optimization-induced fragility in preference-based objectives. In this work, we revisit robustness for LLM safety alignment from an optimization geometry perspective, and argue that robustness failures cannot be addressed by data-centric methods alone. We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07341v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper focuses on the scalable robot learning for manipulation in the dexterous robot arm-hand systems, where the remote human-robot interactions via augmented reality (AR) are established to collect the expert demonstration data for improving efficiency. In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse. Supplementary demonstrations are available at https://cyberyyc.github.io/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values has become increasingly important as their influence on human behavior and decision-making expands. However, existing steering-based alignment methods suffer from limited controllability: steering a target value often unintentionally activates other, non-target values. To characterize this limitation, we introduce value leakage, a diagnostic notion that captures the unintended activation of non-target values during value steering, along with a normalized leakage metric grounded in Schwartz's value theory. In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining. Experiments show that NeVA achieves stronger target value alignment while incurring smaller performance degradation on general capability. Moreover, NeVA significantly reduces the average leakage, with residual effects largely confined to semantically related value classes. Overall, NeVA offers a more controllable and interpretable mechanism for value alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07358v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unlearnable examples (UE) have emerged as a practical mechanism to prevent unauthorized model training on private vision data, while extending this protection to tabular data is nontrivial. Tabular data in finance and healthcare is highly sensitive, yet existing UE methods transfer poorly because tabular features mix numerical and categorical constraints and exhibit saliency sparsity, with learning dominated by a few dimensions. Under a Spectral Dominance condition, we show certified unlearnability is feasible when the poison spectrum overwhelms the clean semantic spectrum. Guided by this, we propose Unlearnable Tabular Data via DecOuPled Shortcut EmbeddIng (UTOPIA), which exploits feature redundancy to decouple optimization into two channels: high saliency features for semantic obfuscation and low saliency redundant features for embedding a hyper correlated shortcut, yielding constraint-aware dominant shortcuts while preserving tabular validity. Extensive experiments across tabular datasets and models show UTOPIA drives unauthorized training toward near random performance, outperforming strong UE baselines and transferring well across architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07364v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) naturally align with sparse operators and unstructured discretizations, making them a promising paradigm for physics-informed machine learning in computational mechanics. Motivated by discrete physics losses and Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) constructions, we embed finite-element (FEM) computations at nodes and Gauss points directly into message-passing layers and propose a numerically consistent FEM-Informed Hypergraph Neural Networks (FHGNN). Similar to conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), training is purely physics-driven and requires no labeled data: the input is a node element hypergraph whose edges encode mesh connectivity. Guided by empirical results and condition-number analysis, we adopt an efficient variational loss. Validated on 3D benchmarks, including cyclic loading with isotropic/kinematic hardening, the proposed method delivers substantially improved accuracy and efficiency over recent, competitive PINN variants. By leveraging GPU-parallel tensor operations and the discrete representation, it scales effectively to large elastoplastic problems and can be competitive with, or faster than, multi-core FEM implementations at comparable accuracy. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, physics-embedded learning in nonlinear solid mechanics.

In the online model, we give a private analog of the influential Winnow algorithm for learning halfspaces with mistake bound polylogarithmic in the dimension and inverse polynomial in the margin. As an application, we describe how to privately learn decision lists in the online model, qualitatively matching state-of-the art non-private guarantees.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07378v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The dynamics of gradient-based training in neural networks often exhibit nontrivial structures; hence, understanding them remains a central challenge in theoretical machine learning. In particular, a concept of feature unlearning, in which a neural network progressively loses previously learned features over long training, has gained attention. In this study, we consider the infinite-width limit of a two-layer neural network updated with a large-batch stochastic gradient, then derive differential equations with different time scales, revealing the mechanism and conditions for feature unlearning to occur. Specifically, we utilize the fast-slow dynamics: while an alignment of first-layer weights develops rapidly, the second-layer weights develop slowly. The direction of a flow on a critical manifold, determined by the slow dynamics, decides whether feature unlearning occurs. We give numerical validation of the result, and derive theoretical grounding and scaling laws of the feature unlearning. Our results yield the following insights: (i) the strength of the primary nonlinear term in data induces the feature unlearning, and (ii) an initial scale of the second-layer weights mitigates the feature unlearning. Technically, our analysis utilizes Tensor Programs and the singular perturbation theory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-attention dominates the computational and memory cost of long-context LLM inference across both prefill and decode phases. To address this challenge, we introduce Sketch&amp;Walk Attention, a training-free sparse attention method that determines sparsity with lightweight sketches and deterministic walk. Sketch&amp;Walk applies Hadamard sketching to get inexpensive approximations of attention scores, then aggregates these estimates across layers via a walk mechanism that captures attention influence beyond direct interactions between tokens. The accumulated walk scores are used to select top-k attention blocks, enabling dynamic sparsity with a single training-free algorithm that applies uniformly to both the prefill and decode phases, together with custom sparse attention kernels. Across a wide range of models and tasks, Sketch&amp;Walk maintains near-lossless accuracy at 20% attention density and can slightly outperform dense attention in some settings, while achieving up to 6x inference speedup.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The energy and latency costs of deep neural network inference are increasingly driven by deployment rather than training, motivating hardware-specialized alternatives to arithmetic-heavy models. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide an attractive substrate for such specialization, yet existing FPGA-based neural approaches are fragmented and difficult to compare. We present BitLogic, a fully gradient-based, end-to-end trainable framework for FPGA-native neural networks built around Lookup Table (LUT) computation. BitLogic replaces multiply-accumulate operations with differentiable LUT nodes that map directly to FPGA primitives, enabling native binary computation, sparse connectivity, and efficient hardware realization. The framework offers a modular functional API supporting diverse architectures, along with learned encoders, hardware-aware heads, and multiple boundary-consistent LUT relaxations. An automated Register Transfer Level (RTL) export pipeline translates trained PyTorch models into synthesizable HDL, ensuring equivalence between software and hardware inference. Experiments across standard vision benchmarks and heterogeneous hardware platforms demonstrate competitive accuracy and substantial gains in FPGA efficiency, including 72.3% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 achieved with fewer than 0.3M logic gates, while attaining sub-20 ns single-sample inference using only LUT resources.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07411v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work focuses on Bayesian optimization (BO) under reward model uncertainty. We propose the first BO algorithm that achieves no-regret guarantee in a general reward setting, requiring only Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and accommodating a broad class of measurement noise. The core of our approach is a novel surrogate model, termed as infinite Gaussian process ($\infty$-GP). It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution. Furthermore, with a truncated Gibbs sampling procedure, our method is computationally scalable, incurring minimal additional memory and computational complexities compared to classical GP. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in settings with non-stationary, heavy-tailed, or other ill-conditioned rewards.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chirality is a fundamental molecular property that governs stereospecific behavior in chemistry and biology. Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07418v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In adversarial multi-armed bandits, two performance measures are commonly used: static regret, which compares the learner to the best fixed arm, and dynamic regret, which compares it to the best sequence of arms. While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.   Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets. This yields a new model selection procedure for bandits that may be of independent interest.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While adaptive gradient methods are the workhorse of modern machine learning, sign-based optimization algorithms such as Lion and Muon have recently demonstrated superior empirical performance over AdamW in training large language models (LLM). However, a theoretical understanding of why sign-based updates outperform variance-adapted methods remains elusive. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails. Empirically, LLM pretraining experiments validate our theoretical insights and confirm that our proposed noise models are well-aligned with practice.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07429v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the industry standard for computer-aided design (CAD). While deep learning shows promise in processing B-rep models, existing methods suffer from a representation gap: continuous approaches offer analytical precision but are visually abstract, whereas discrete methods provide intuitive clarity at the expense of geometric precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric B\'ezier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Brep2Shape offers significant scalability, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and faster convergence across various downstream tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07440v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that strategically selects the most informative samples for annotation during training, aiming to minimize annotation costs. This strategy not only reduces labeling expenses but also results in energy savings during neural network training, thereby enhancing both data and energy efficiency. In this paper, we implement and evaluate various state-of-the-art acquisition functions, analyzing their accuracy and computational costs, while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network. This trade-off is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration. Our aggregated acquisition functions alleviate common AL pathologies such as batch mode inefficiency and the cold start problem. Additionally, we focus on balancing accuracy and energy consumption, contributing to the development of more sustainable, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluate our proposed structures on various models and datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of these structures to reduce computational costs while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Innovative aggregation approaches, such as alternating between acquisition functions such as BALD and BADGE, have shown robust results. Sequentially running functions like $K$-Centers followed by BALD has achieved the same performance goals with up to 12\% fewer samples, while reducing the acquisition cost by almost half.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07441v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes policies from a previously collected static dataset and is an important branch of RL. A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07453v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision tree ensembles are widely used in critical domains, making robustness and sensitivity analysis essential to their trustworthiness. We study the feature sensitivity problem, which asks whether an ensemble is sensitive to a specified subset of features -- such as protected attributes -- whose manipulation can alter model predictions. Existing approaches often yield examples of sensitivity that lie far from the training distribution, limiting their interpretability and practical value. We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles. Third, we introduce a data-aware framework generating realistic examples close to the training distribution. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on large tree ensembles, demonstrating scalability to ensembles with up to 800 trees of depth 8, achieving substantial improvements over the state of the art. This framework provides a practical foundation for analyzing the reliability and fairness of tree-based models in high-stakes applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a cornerstone for efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs), where a small calibration set critically affects quantization performance. However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically highlight the role of multi-scale calibration in LLM quantization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07472v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms allocate pulls among competing arms, the resulting allocation can exhibit huge variation. This is particularly harmful in modern applications such as learning-enhanced platform operations and post-bandit statistical inference. Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \cdot S_T=\Omega(T^{\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\rightarrow\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $\Theta(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= \omega(\sqrt{T})$. We further show that this lower bound is essentially tight, and that any point on the Pareto frontier $R_T \cdot S_T=\tilde{\Theta}(T^{3/2})$ can be achieved by a simple tunable algorithm UCB-f, a generalization of the classic UCB1. Finally, we discuss implications for platform operations and for statistical inference, when bandit algorithms are used. As a byproduct of our result, we resolve an open question of Praharaj and Khamaru (2025).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: scRNA-seq clustering is a critical task for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, as it groups cells with similar gene expression profiles. Transformers, as powerful foundational models, have been applied to scRNA-seq clustering. Their self-attention mechanism automatically assigns higher attention weights to cells within the same cluster, enhancing the distinction between clusters. Existing methods for scRNA-seq clustering, such as graph transformer-based models, treat each cell as a token in a sequence. Their computational and space complexities are $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with respect to the number of cells, limiting their applicability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.To address this challenge, we propose a Bipartite Graph Transformer-based clustering model (BGFormer) for scRNA-seq data. We introduce a set of learnable anchor tokens as shared reference points to represent the entire dataset. A bipartite graph attention mechanism is introduced to learn the similarity between cells and anchor tokens, bringing cells of the same class closer together in the embedding space. BGFormer achieves linear computational complexity with respect to the number of cells, making it scalable to large datasets. Experimental results on multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of BGFormer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Increasing salinity and contamination of groundwater is a serious issue in many parts of the world, causing degradation of water resources. The aim of this work is to form a comprehensive understanding of groundwater salinization underlying causal factors and identify important meteorological, geological and anthropogenic drivers of salinity. We have integrated different datasets of potential covariates, to create a robust framework for machine learning based predictive models including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolution neural network (CNN) and linear regression (LR), of groundwater salinity. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) followed by Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Explainable AI (XAI) based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to estimate the importance scores and find insights into the drivers of salinization. We also did causality analysis via Double machine learning using various predictive models. From these analyses, key meteorological (Precipitation, Temperature), geological (Distance from river, Distance to saline body, TWI, Shoreline distance), and anthropogenic (Area of agriculture field, Treated Wastewater) covariates are identified to be influential drivers of groundwater salinity across Israel. XAI analysis also identified Treated Wastewater (TWW) as an essential anthropogenic driver of salinity, its significance being context-dependent but critical in vulnerable hydro-climatic environment. Our approach provides deeper insight into global salinization mechanisms at country scale, reducing AI model uncertainty and highlighting the need for tailored strategies to address salinity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07479v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning method in deep transfer learning, due to its reduced number of trainable parameters and lower memory requirements enabled by Burer-Monteiro factorization on adaptation matrices. However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the fact that experimental neural scaling laws have substantially guided empirical progress in large-scale machine learning, no existing theory can quantitatively predict the exponents of these important laws for any modern LLM trained on any natural language dataset. We provide the first such theory in the case of data-limited scaling laws. We isolate two key statistical properties of language that alone can predict neural scaling exponents: (i) the decay of pairwise token correlations with time separation between token pairs, and (ii) the decay of the next-token conditional entropy with the length of the conditioning context. We further derive a simple formula in terms of these statistics that predicts data-limited neural scaling exponents from first principles without any free parameters or synthetic data models. Our theory exhibits a remarkable match with experimentally measured neural scaling laws obtained from training GPT-2 and LLaMA style models from scratch on two qualitatively different benchmarks, TinyStories and WikiText.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07494v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deeper modern architectures are costly to train, making hyperparameter transfer preferable to expensive repeated tuning. Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) helps explain why many hyperparameters transfer across width. Yet depth scaling is less understood for modern architectures, whose computation graphs contain multiple parallel paths and residual aggregation. To unify various non-recurrent multi-path neural networks such as CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers, we introduce a graph-based notion of effective depth. Under stabilizing initializations and a maximal-update criterion, we show that the optimal learning rate decays with effective depth following a universal -3/2 power law. Here, the maximal-update criterion maximizes the typical one-step representation change at initialization without causing instability, and effective depth is the minimal path length from input to output, counting layers and residual additions. Experiments across diverse architectures confirm the predicted slope and enable reliable zero-shot transfer of learning rates across depths and widths, turning depth scaling into a predictable hyperparameter-transfer problem.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07496v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) seeks to infer reward functions from expert demonstrations. When demonstrations originate from multiple experts with different intentions, the problem is known as Multi-Intention IRL (MI-IRL). Recent deep generative MI-IRL approaches couple behavior clustering and reward learning, but typically require prior knowledge of the number of true behavioral modes $K^*$. This reliance on expert knowledge limits their adaptability to new behaviors, and only enables analysis related to the learned rewards, and not across the behavior modes used to train them. We propose Contrastive Multi-Intention IRL (CoMI-IRL), a transformer-based unsupervised framework that decouples behavior representation and clustering from downstream reward learning. Our experiments show that CoMI-IRL outperforms existing approaches without a priori knowledge of $K^*$ or labels, while allowing for visual interpretation of behavior relationships and adaptation to unseen behavior without full retraining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulations are an indispensable step in the cycle of theory development and refinement, helping researchers formulate precise definitions, generate models, and make accurate predictions. This paper introduces the Pavlovian Associative Learning Models Simulator (PALMS), a Python environment to simulate Pavlovian conditioning experiments. In addition to the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model, PALMS incorporates several attentional learning approaches, including Pearce-Kaye-Hall, Mackintosh Extended, Le Pelley's Hybrid, and a novel extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model with a unified variable learning rate that integrates Mackintosh's and Pearce and Hall's opposing conceptualisations. The simulator's graphical interface allows for the input of entire experimental designs in an alphanumeric format, akin to that used by experimental neuroscientists. Moreover, it uniquely enables the simulation of experiments involving hundreds of stimuli, as well as the computation of configural cues and configural-cue compounds across all models, thereby considerably expanding their predictive capabilities. PALMS operates efficiently, providing instant visualisation of results, supporting rapid, precise comparisons of various models' predictions within a single architecture and environment. Furthermore, graphic displays can be easily saved, and simulated data can be exported to spreadsheets. To illustrate the simulator's capabilities and functionalities, we provide a detailed description of the software and examples of use, reproducing published experiments in the associative learning literature. PALMS is licensed under the open-source GNU Lesser General Public License 3.0.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07521v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in game AI have demonstrated the feasibility of training agents that surpass top-tier human professionals in complex environments such as Honor of Kings (HoK), a leading mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. However, deploying such powerful agents on mobile devices remains a major challenge. On one hand, the intricate multi-modal state representation and hierarchical action space of HoK demand large, sophisticated policy networks that are inherently difficult to compress into lightweight forms. On the other hand, production deployment requires high-frequency inference under strict energy and latency constraints on mobile platform. To the best of our knowledge, bridging large-scale game AI and practical on-device deployment has not been systematically studied. In this work, we propose a Pareto optimality guided pipeline and design a high-efficiency student architecture search space tailored for mobile execution, enabling systematic exploration of the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the distilled model achieves remarkable efficiency, including an $12.4\times$ faster inference speed (under 0.5ms per frame) and a $15.6\times$ improvement in energy efficiency (under 0.5mAh per game), while retaining a 40.32% win rate against the original teacher model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance and rapid progress in a wide range of medical reasoning tasks. However, their sequential autoregressive decoding forces inherently parallel clinical reasoning, such as differential diagnosis, into a single linear reasoning path, limiting both efficiency and reliability for complex medical problems. To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%. Compared to specialized medical LLMs, MedVerse achieves comparable performance while delivering a 1.3x reduction in inference latency and a 1.7x increase in generation throughput, enabled by its parallel decoding capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conformal prediction provides rigorous, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees, but often yields prohibitively large prediction sets in structured domains such as routing, planning, or sequential recommendation. We introduce "graph-based conformal compression", a framework for constructing compact subgraphs that preserve statistical validity while reducing structural complexity. We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees. Our results on the one hand bridge efficient conformal prediction with combinatorial graph compression via monotonicity, to provide rigorous guarantees on both statistical validity, and compression or size. On the other hand, they also highlight an algorithmic regime, distinct from classical densest-$k$-subgraph hardness settings, where the problem can be approximated efficiently. We finally validate our algorithmic approach via simulations for trip planning and navigation, and compare to natural baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07562v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Match-and-copy is a core retrieval primitive used at inference time by large language models to retrieve a matching token from the context then copy its successor. Yet, understanding how this behavior emerges on natural data is challenging because retrieval and memorization are entangled. To disentangle the two, we introduce Gaussian Match-and-Copy (GMC), a minimalist benchmark that isolates long-range retrieval through pure second-order correlation signals. Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection. We prove this max-margin alignment for GD trajectories that reach vanishing empirical loss under explicit technical conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07579v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensemble methods have played a crucial role in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various machine learning tasks by leveraging the diversity of features learned by individual models. In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models. This makes our method both efficient and scalable compared to conventional NN-based ensemble approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07588v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide a fundamental tool for characterizing molecular behavior at full atomic resolution, but their applicability is severely constrained by the computational cost. To address this, a surge of deep generative models has recently emerged to learn dynamics at coarsened timesteps for efficient trajectory generation, yet they either generalize poorly across systems or, due to limited molecular diversity of trajectory data, fail to fully exploit structural information to improve generative fidelity. Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses. Experiments on proteins and protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that PVB faithfully reproduces thermodynamic and kinetic observables from MD while delivering stable and efficient generative dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07593v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern benchmarks such as HELM MMLU account for multiple metrics like accuracy, robustness and efficiency. When trying to turn these metrics into a single ranking, natural aggregation procedures can become incoherent or unstable to changes in the model set. We formalize this aggregation as a social choice problem where each metric induces a preference ranking over models on each dataset, and a benchmark operator aggregates these votes across metrics. While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models. Empirically, we investigate several modern benchmark suites like HELM MMLU and verify which structural conditions are fulfilled on which benchmark problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07596v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is crucial for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) deployment but suffers from accuracy degradation caused by weight and activation outliers. Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard Transformers excel at semantic modeling but struggle with   rigid sequential logic and state tracking. Theoretical work   establishes that self-attention is limited to $\AC^0$ (under hard   attention) or $\TC^0$ (under soft attention), complexity classes   that often fail to support robust length generalization on   sequential problems without intermediate chain-of-thought. In this   work, we introduce \emph{Rational Transductors}, a dual-stream   architecture that augments the Transformer with a matrix-valued   recurrence derived from Weighted Finite Automata (WFA). By   injecting rational state information into the attention mechanism   via a \emph{Deep Rational Injection} scheme, our framework strictly   generalizes the expressive power of Transformers to capture all   Regular Languages, $\NC^1$-complete problems (such as Boolean   Formula Evaluation), and fundamental separations like Parity and   Modular Counting, while preserving $O(L + \log T)$ parallel time   complexity. We ground the architecture in a rigorous learning   theory: we prove that \emph{Random Rational Features} act as a   universal basis for sequential dependencies, justifying our   initialization strategy, while establishing that the   \emph{Differentiable Rational Feature} regime is necessary to close   the representational compactness gap. Theoretical analysis and   empirical results demonstrate that Rational Transductors solve the   "Regular Gap," enabling robust length generalization on algorithmic   tasks where standard Transformers fail, without the sequential   computational bottlenecks of traditional RNNs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07602v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Building models of the world from observation, i.e., induction, is one of the major challenges in machine learning. In order to be useful, models need to maintain accuracy when used in novel situations, i.e., generalize. In addition, they should be easy to interpret and efficient to train. Prior work has investigated these concepts in the context of object-oriented representations inspired by human cognition. In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm that is substantially more powerful than these previous methods. Our thorough experiments, including ablation tests and comparison with neural baselines, demonstrate a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training implicit neural representations (INRs) to capture fine-scale details typically relies on iterative backpropagation and is often hindered by spectral bias when the target exhibits highly non-uniform frequency content. We propose ELM-INR, a backpropagation-free INR that decomposes the domain into overlapping subdomains and fits each local problem using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in closed form, replacing iterative optimization with stable linear least-squares solutions. This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity. Building on this insight, we introduce BEAM, an adaptive mesh refinement strategy that balances spectral complexity across subdomains to improve reconstruction quality in capacity-constrained regimes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures employ sparse activation to deliver faster training and inference with higher accuracy than dense LLMs. However, in production serving, MoE models require batch inference to optimize hardware efficiency, which may cause excessive expert activation and thus slow the memory-bound decoding stage. To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment. Code implementation of SERE can be found in https://github.com/JL-Cheng/SERE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate the approximation capabilities of dense neural networks. While universal approximation theorems establish that sufficiently large architectures can approximate arbitrary continuous functions if there are no restrictions on the weight values, we show that dense neural networks do not possess this universality. Our argument is based on a model compression approach, combining the weak regularity lemma with an interpretation of feedforward networks as message passing graph neural networks. We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity. Within this setting, we demonstrate the existence of Lipschitz continuous functions that cannot be approximated by such networks. This highlights intrinsic limitations of neural networks with dense layers and motivates the use of sparse connectivity as a necessary ingredient for achieving true universality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07640v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out-of-distribution detection methods are often either data-centric, detecting deviations from the training input distribution irrespective of their effect on a trained model, or model-centric, relying on classifier outputs without explicit reference to data geometry. We propose TASTE (Task-Aware STEin operators): a task-aware framework based on so-called Stein operators, which allows us to link distribution shift to the input sensitivity of the model. We show that the resulting operator admits a clear geometric interpretation as a projection of distribution shift onto the sensitivity field of the model, yielding theoretical guarantees. Beyond detecting the presence of a shift, the same construction enables its localisation through a coordinate-wise decomposition, and for image data-provides interpretable per-pixel diagnostics. Experiments on controlled Gaussian shifts, MNIST under geometric perturbations, and CIFAR-10 perturbed benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method aligns closely with task degradation while outperforming established baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07659v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Genetic Programming yields interpretable programs, but small syntactic mutations can induce large, unpredictable behavioral shifts, degrading locality and sample efficiency. We frame this as an operator-design problem: learn a continuous program space where latent distance has behavioral meaning, then design mutation operators that exploit this structure without changing the evolutionary optimizer.   We make locality measurable by tracking action-level divergence under controlled latent perturbations, identifying an empirical trust region for behavior-local continuous variation. Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes.   Under identical $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio. Although isotropic mutation occasionally attains higher peak performance, geometry-compiled mutation yields faster, more reliable progress, demonstrating that semantically aligned mutation can substantially improve search efficiency without modifying the underlying evolutionary algorithm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07670v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) adapts language models through gradient-based updates at inference. But is adaptation the right strategy? We study compute-optimal test-time strategies for verifiable execution-grounded (VEG) tasks, domains like GPU kernel optimization where a deterministic evaluator provides dense, continuous reward signals. Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's "equivalent K" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation. The surprisal-guided selection principle may generalize to other execution-grounded domains where optimal solutions occupy the distribution tail.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across clients without sharing raw data, but its performance degrades under real-world data heterogeneity. Existing methods often fail to address distribution shift across clients and distribution drift over time, or they rely on unrealistic assumptions such as known number of client clusters and data heterogeneity types, which limits their generalizability. We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg. These results highlight that distribution-profile-based aggregation offers a practical path toward robust FL under both data distribution shifts and drifts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07674v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning models now influence decisions that directly affect people's lives, making it important to understand not only their predictions, but also how individuals could act to obtain better results. Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes. However, when the Rashomon set - the set of near-optimal models - is large, standard counterfactual explanations can become unreliable, as a recourse action valid for one model may fail under another. We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines. This provides a principled and practical solution for reliable recourse under model uncertainty, ensuring stable recommendations for users even as models evolve.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gating mechanisms are ubiquitous, yet a complementary question in feed-forward networks remains under-explored: how to introduce frequency-rich expressivity without sacrificing stability and scalability? This tension is exposed by spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) parameterizations, where grid refinement can induce parameter growth and brittle optimization in high dimensions. To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization. SGN augments a standard activation pathway with a compact spectral pathway and learnable gates that allow the model to start from a stable base behavior and progressively allocate capacity to spectral features during training. The spectral pathway is instantiated with trainable Random Fourier Features (learned frequencies and phases), replacing grid-based splines and removing resolution dependence. A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants. Code and trained models will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07697v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is a biologically plausible alternative to standard backpropagation (BP) that minimises an energy function with respect to network activities before updating weights. Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07706v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models for medical data are typically trained using task specific objectives that encourage representations to collapse onto a small number of discriminative directions. While effective for individual prediction problems, this paradigm underutilizes the rich structure of clinical data and limits the transferability, stability, and interpretability of learned features. In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines. These results suggest that learning to span clinical variation may be as important as learning to predict clinical outcomes, and position representation geometry as a first class objective in medical AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07708v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating the quality of post-hoc explanations for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge. While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07712v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The quality of Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget and the choice of optimization algorithm. Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07715v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recovering a signal from its degraded measurements is a long standing challenge in science and engineering. Recently, zero-shot diffusion based methods have been proposed for such inverse problems, offering a posterior sampling based solution that leverages prior knowledge. Such algorithms incorporate the observations through inference, often leaning on manual tuning and heuristics. In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07719v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning and classical planning are typically seen as two distinct problems, with differing formulations necessitating different solutions. Yet, when humans are given a task, regardless of the way it is specified, they can often derive the additional information needed to solve the problem efficiently. The key to this ability is introspection: by reasoning about their internal models of the problem, humans directly synthesize additional task-relevant information. In this paper, we propose that this introspection can be thought of as program analysis. We discuss examples of how this approach can be applied to various kinds of models used in reinforcement learning. We then describe an algorithm that enables efficient goal-oriented planning over the class of models used in relational reinforcement learning, demonstrating a novel link between reinforcement learning and classical planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07721v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: KV-cache retrieval is essential for long-context LLM inference, yet existing methods struggle with distribution drift and high latency at scale. We introduce ParisKV, a drift-robust, GPU-native KV-cache retrieval framework based on collision-based candidate selection, followed by a quantized inner-product reranking estimator. For million-token contexts, ParisKV supports CPU-offloaded KV caches via Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA), enabling on-demand top-$k$ fetching with minimal overhead. ParisKV matches or outperforms full attention quality on long-input and long-generation benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art long-context decoding efficiency: it matches or exceeds full attention speed even at batch size 1 for long contexts, delivers up to 2.8$\times$ higher throughput within full attention's runnable range, and scales to million-token contexts where full attention runs out of memory. At million-token scale, ParisKV reduces decode latency by 17$\times$ and 44$\times$ compared to MagicPIG and PQCache, respectively, two state-of-the-art KV-cache Top-$k$ retrieval baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07730v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Across scientific disciplines, Laplacian eigenvectors serve as a fundamental basis for simplifying complex systems, from signal processing to quantum mechanics. In reinforcement learning (RL), these eigenvectors provide a natural basis for approximating reward functions; however, their use is typically limited to their linear span, which restricts expressivity in complex environments. We introduce the Laplacian Keyboard (LK), a hierarchical framework that goes beyond the linear span. LK constructs a task-agnostic library of options from these eigenvectors, forming a behavior basis guaranteed to contain the optimal policy for any reward within the linear span. A meta-policy learns to stitch these options dynamically, enabling efficient learning of policies outside the original linear constraints. We establish theoretical bounds on zero-shot approximation error and demonstrate empirically that LK surpasses zero-shot solutions while achieving improved sample efficiency compared to standard RL methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern data workflows are inherently adaptive, repeatedly querying the same dataset to refine and validate sequential decisions, but such adaptivity can lead to overfitting and invalid statistical inference. Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020). Our results thus reveal an inherent connection between adaptive data analysis and privacy beyond differential privacy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07735v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present TerraBind, a foundation model for protein-ligand structure and binding affinity prediction that achieves 26-fold faster inference than state-of-the-art methods while improving affinity prediction accuracy by $\sim$20\%. Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_\beta$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\sim$20\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery. Furthermore, this module enables a continual learning framework and a hedged batch selection strategy that, in simulated drug discovery cycles, achieves 6$\times$ greater affinity improvement of selected molecules over greedy-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study inference-time reward-guided alignment for generative models. Existing methods often rely on either architecture-specific adaptations or computationally costly inference procedures. We introduce Learnable Chernoff Baselines (LCBs) as a method for efficiently and approximately sampling from the exponentially tilted kernels that arise from KL-regularized reward alignment. Using only black-box sampling access to the pretrained model, LCBs implement a form of rejection sampling with adaptively selected acceptance probabilities, which allows fine-grained control over inference-compute scaling. We establish total-variation guarantees to the ideal aligned model, and demonstrate in both continuous and discrete diffusion settings that LCB sampling closely matches ideal rejection sampling while using substantially fewer queries to the pretrained model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07744v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have become the dominant paradigm for generative modeling on Riemannian manifolds, with successful applications in protein backbone generation and DNA sequence design. However, these methods require tens to hundreds of neural network evaluations at inference time, which can become a computational bottleneck in large-scale scientific sampling workflows. We introduce Riemannian MeanFlow~(RMF), a framework for learning flow maps directly on manifolds, enabling high-quality generations with as few as one forward pass. We derive three equivalent characterizations of the manifold average velocity (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and semigroup identities), and analyze parameterizations and stabilization techniques to improve training on high-dimensional manifolds. In promoter DNA design and protein backbone generation settings, RMF achieves comparable sample quality to prior methods while requiring up to 10$\times$ fewer function evaluations. Finally, we show that few-step flow maps enable efficient reward-guided design through reward look-ahead, where terminal states can be predicted from intermediate steps at minimal additional cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07764v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) seeks to learn policies that balance multiple, often conflicting objectives. Although a single preference-conditioned policy is the most flexible and scalable solution, existing approaches remain brittle in practice, frequently failing to recover complete Pareto fronts. We show that this failure stems from two structural issues in current methods: destructive gradient interference caused by premature scalarization and representational collapse across the preference space. We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07790v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically trained on a diverse set of multi-modal domains, yet current practices rely on costly manual tuning. We propose MaD-Mix, a principled and computationally efficient framework that derives multi-modal data mixtures for VLM training. MaD-Mix formulates data mixing as modality-aware domain alignment maximization and obtains closed-form multi-modal alignment scores from the Fenchel dual through inter-modal coupling variables. MaD-Mix systematically handles domains with missing modalities, allowing for the integration of language-only domains. Empirical evaluations across 0.5B and 7B models demonstrate that MaD-Mix accelerates VLM training across diverse benchmarks. MaD-Mix matches human-tuned data mixtures using 22% fewer training steps in image-text instruction tuning. In complex tri-modal video-image-text scenarios, where manual tuning becomes impractical, MaD-Mix boosts average accuracy over uniform weights, with negligible mixture computation overhead (< 1 GPU-hour), enabling scalable mixture design for modern VLM pipelines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07798v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting anomalies in tabular data is critical for many real-world applications, such as credit card fraud detection. With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art performance in tabular anomaly detection has been achieved by converting tabular data into text and fine-tuning LLMs. However, these methods randomly order columns during conversion, without considering the causal relationships between them, which is crucial for accurately detecting anomalies. In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect. Experiments across more than 30 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. The code for CausalTAD is available at https://github.com/350234/CausalTAD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07799v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Demographic skews in human preference data propagate systematic unfairness through reward models into aligned LLMs. We introduce Fairness Aware Reward Optimization (Faro), an in-processing framework that trains reward models under demographic parity, equalized odds, or counterfactual fairness constraints. We provide the first theoretical analysis of reward-level fairness in LLM alignment, establishing: (i) provable fairness certificates for Faro-trained rewards with controllable slack; a (ii) formal characterization of the accuracy-fairness trade-off induced by KL-regularized fine-tuning, proving fairness transfers from reward to policy; and the (iii) existence of a non-empty Pareto frontier. Unlike pre- and post-processing methods, Faro ensures reward models are simultaneously ordinal (ranking correctly), cardinal (calibrated), and fair. Across multiple LLMs and benchmarks, Faro significantly reduces bias and harmful generations while maintaining or improving model quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their use for numerical computation has received less attention. We study the approximation of matrix functions, which map scalar functions to matrices, using neural networks including transformers. We focus on functions mapping square matrices to square matrices of the same dimension. These types of matrix functions appear throughout scientific computing, e.g., the matrix exponential in continuous-time Markov chains and the matrix sign function in stability analysis of dynamical systems. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we prove bounds on the width and depth of ReLU networks needed to approximate the matrix exponential to an arbitrary precision. Second, we show experimentally that a transformer encoder-decoder with suitable numerical encodings can approximate certain matrix functions at a relative error of 5% with high probability. Our study reveals that the encoding scheme strongly affects performance, with different schemes working better for different functions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07828v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: What is the most brute-force way to install interpretable, controllable features into a model's activations? Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry. We bypass all of this.   We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations. A model's efficiency pressure is a lever - exploitable to induce interpretable, controllable representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Process rewards have been widely used in deep reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, reduce variance, and prevent reward hacking. In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems. Finally, we validate our training recipe and key design choices via a detailed ablation study.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Calabi--Yau manifolds are essential for string theory but require computing intractable metrics. Here we show that symbolic regression can distill neural approximations into simple, interpretable formulas. Our five-term expression matches neural accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9994$) with 3,000-fold fewer parameters. Multi-seed validation confirms that geometric constraints select essential features, specifically power sums and symmetric polynomials, while permitting structural diversity. The functional form can be maintained across the studied moduli range ($\psi \in [0, 0.8]$) with coefficients varying smoothly; we interpret these trends as empirical hypotheses within the accuracy regime of the locally-trained teachers ($\sigma \approx 8-9\%$ at $\psi \neq 0$). The formula reproduces physical observables -- volume integrals and Yukawa couplings -- validating that symbolic distillation recovers compact, interpretable models for quantities previously accessible only to black-box networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While the complex reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention, single-agent systems often encounter inherent performance ceilings in complex tasks such as code generation. Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07859v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers has made large electronic load (LEL) modeling increasingly important for power system analysis. Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems. We find that interactions among LELs can fundamentally alter post-disturbance recovery behavior, producing compound disconnection-reconnection dynamics and delayed stabilization that are not captured by uncalibrated load models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07873v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Soft policies in reinforcement learning define policies as Boltzmann distributions over state-action value functions, providing a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement. On OpenAI Gym MuJoCo benchmarks, NC-LQL achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating tabular data under conditions is critical to applications requiring precise control over the generative process. Existing methods rely on training-time strategies that do not generalise to unseen constraints during inference, and struggle to handle conditional tasks beyond tabular imputation. While manifold theory offers a principled way to guide generation, current formulations are tied to specific inference-time objectives and are limited to continuous domains. We extend manifold theory to tabular data and expand its scope to handle diverse inference-time objectives. On this foundation, we introduce HARPOON, a tabular diffusion method that guides unconstrained samples along the manifold geometry to satisfy diverse tabular conditions at inference. We validate our theoretical contributions empirically on tasks such as imputation and enforcing inequality constraints, demonstrating HARPOON'S strong performance across diverse datasets and the practical benefits of manifold-aware guidance for tabular data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07884v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Survival analysis is complicated by censored data, high-dimensional features, and non-linear interactions. Classical models are interpretable but restrictive, while deep learning models are flexible but often non-interpretable and sensitive to noise. We propose GRAFT (Gated Residual Accelerated Failure Time), a novel AFT model that decouples prognostic ranking from calibration. GRAFT's hybrid architecture combines a linear AFT model with a non-linear residual neural network, and it also integrates stochastic gates for automatic, end-to-end feature selection. The model is trained by directly optimizing a differentiable, C-index-aligned ranking loss using stochastic conditional imputation from local Kaplan-Meier estimators. In public benchmarks, GRAFT outperforms baselines in discrimination and calibration, while remaining robust and sparse in high-noise settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07889v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pseudo-count is an effective anti-exploration method in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by counting state-action pairs and imposing a large penalty on rare or unseen state-action pair data. Existing anti-exploration methods count continuous state-action pairs by discretizing these data, but often suffer from the issues of dimension disaster and information loss in the discretization process, leading to efficiency and performance reduction, and even failure of policy learning. In this paper, a novel anti-exploration method based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and fuzzy clustering in offline RL is proposed. We first propose an efficient pseudo-count method based on the multi-codebook VQVAE to discretize state-action pairs, and design an offline RL anti-exploitation method based on the proposed pseudo-count method to handle the dimension disaster issue and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a codebook update mechanism based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is developed to improve the use rate of vectors in codebooks, addressing the information loss issue in the discretization process. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark of Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL), and experimental results show that the proposed method performs better and requires less computing cost in multiple complex tasks compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often incur an alignment tax: safety post-training can reduce general utility (e.g., reasoning and coding). We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines. For instance, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct under SFT$\rightarrow$DPO, OGPSA preserves strong safety while recovering general capability, improving SimpleQA from 0.53\% to 3.03\% and IFEval from 51.94\% to 63.96\%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07904v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian Optimization critically depends on the choice of acquisition function, but no single strategy is universally optimal; the best choice is non-stationary and problem-dependent. Existing adaptive portfolio methods often base their decisions on past function values while ignoring richer information like remaining budget or surrogate model characteristics. To address this, we introduce LMABO, a novel framework that casts a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot, online strategist for the BO process. At each iteration, LMABO uses a structured state representation to prompt the LLM to select the most suitable acquisition function from a diverse portfolio. In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines. We show that the LLM's behavior is a comprehensive strategy that adapts to real-time progress, proving its advantage stems from its ability to process and synthesize the complete optimization state into an effective, adaptive policy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07906v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) requires agents to perform sustained, iterative optimization over long horizons. While recent LLM-based agents show promise, current prompt-based agents for MLE suffer from behavioral stagnation due to frozen parameters. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a remedy, applying it to MLE is hindered by prohibitive execution latency and inefficient data selection. Recognizing these challenges, we propose AceGRPO with two core components: (1) Evolving Data Buffer that continuously repurposes execution traces into reusable training tasks, and (2) Adaptive Sampling guided by a Learnability Potential function, which dynamically prioritizes tasks at the agent's learning frontier to maximize learning efficiency. Leveraging AceGRPO, our trained Ace-30B model achieves a 100% valid submission rate on MLE-Bench-Lite, approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models, and outperforms larger open-source baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.2), demonstrating robust capability for sustained iterative optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Causal discovery from time series is a fundamental task in machine learning. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by a reliance on untestable causal assumptions and by the lack of robustness-oriented evaluation in existing benchmarks. To address these challenges, we propose CausalCompass, a flexible and extensible benchmark suite designed to assess the robustness of time-series causal discovery (TSCD) methods under violations of modeling assumptions. To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization. Finally, our work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of TSCD methods under assumption violations, thereby facilitating their broader adoption in real-world applications. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/huiyang-yi/CausalCompass.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07928v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow-based generative models can be viewed through a physics lens: sampling transports a particle from noise to data by integrating a time-varying velocity field, and each sample corresponds to a trajectory with its own dynamical effort. Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples. This yields a Goldilocks principle and motivates Kinetic Trajectory Shaping (KTS), a training-free two-phase inference strategy that boosts early motion and enforces a late-time soft landing, reducing memorization and improving generation quality across benchmark tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07933v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a critical challenge in medical diagnostics due to the subtlety of early-stage symptoms and the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in biomedical data. Traditional machine learning (ML) models, though widely applied to PD detection, often rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture complex feature interactions. This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data. We present a comparative evaluation of four classification models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, TabNet, and SAINT, using a benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of biomedical voice measurements from PD patients and healthy controls.   Experimental results show that SAINT consistently outperformed all baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving a weighted precision of 0.98, weighted recall of 0.97, weighted F1-score of 0.97, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9990, and the highest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores. The superior performance of SAINT is attributed to its dual attention mechanism, which effectively models feature interactions within and across samples.   These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of attention-based deep learning architectures for early Parkinson's disease detection and highlight the importance of dynamic feature representation in clinical prediction tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning performed over finite time is necessarily irreversible. In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit, which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time learning.   In this work (Part~II), we study the consequences of this irreversibility for continual learning from a trajectory-level perspective. We show that finite dissipation constrains not only which solutions are reachable, but which learning paths remain dynamically accessible.   Although a continuum of task-equivalent realizations can achieve identical task performance, finite-time learning irreversibly selects among these realizations. This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget.   As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07966v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In many machine learning contexts, tasks are often treated as interconnected components with the goal of leveraging knowledge transfer between them, which is the central aim of Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.   ALE curves are compared using the Fr\'echet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.   We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural classifiers in a neurosymbolic setting where the hidden gold labels of input instances must satisfy a logical formula. Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Across 16 benchmarks over complex neurosymbolic tasks, we demonstrate that CLIPPER boosts the performance of state-of-the-art neurosymbolic engines like Scallop, Dolphin, and ISED by up to 48%, 53%, and 8%, leading to state-of-the-art accuracies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07974v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary ML often equates intelligence with optimization: searching for solutions within a fixed representational geometry. This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The emergence of compositional reasoning in large language models through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a key driver of recent empirical successes. Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR. We also analyze how such an advantage naturally arises in different problems. On the negative side, when the structural advantage is not present, RLVR may converge to suboptimal compositions. We prove that, in some cases, the quality of the base model determines if such an advantage exists and whether RLVR will converge to a suboptimal solution. We hope our analysis can provide a principled theoretical understanding of when and why RLVR succeeds and when it does not.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) under the unichain assumption and general policy parameterizations. Existing regret analyses for constrained reinforcement learning largely rely on ergodicity or strong mixing-time assumptions, which fail to hold in the presence of transient states. We propose a primal--dual natural actor--critic algorithm that leverages multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators and an explicit burn-in mechanism to handle unichain dynamics without requiring mixing-time oracles. Our analysis establishes finite-time regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds that scale as $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, up to approximation errors arising from policy and critic parameterization, thereby extending order-optimal guarantees to a significantly broader class of CMDPs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often ensembled together to improve overall reliability and robustness, but in practice models are strongly correlated. This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews. Across all datasets, we observe that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under the same query budget.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As foundation models continue to scale, pretraining increasingly relies on data-parallel distributed optimization, making bandwidth-limited gradient synchronization a key bottleneck. Orthogonally, projection-based low-rank optimizers were mainly designed for memory efficiency, but remain suboptimal for communication-limited training: one-sided synchronization still transmits an $O(rn)$ object for an $m\times n$ matrix gradient and refresh steps can dominate peak communicated bytes. We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\top G V\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale flow and diffusion models raised two fundamental algorithmic challenges: (i) control-based reward adaptation of pre-trained flows, and (ii) integration of multiple models, i.e., flow merging. While current approaches address them separately, we introduce a unifying probability-space framework that subsumes both as limit cases, and enables reward-guided flow merging, allowing principled, task-aware combination of multiple pre-trained flows (e.g., merging priors while maximizing drug-discovery utilities). Our formulation renders possible to express a rich family of operators over generative models densities, including intersection (e.g., to enforce safety), union (e.g., to compose diverse models), interpolation (e.g., for discovery), their reward-guided counterparts, as well as complex logical expressions via generative circuits. Next, we introduce Reward-Guided Flow Merging (RFM), a mirror-descent scheme that reduces reward-guided flow merging to a sequence of standard fine-tuning problems. Then, we provide first-of-their-kind theoretical guarantees for reward-guided and pure flow merging via RFM. Ultimately, we showcase the capabilities of the proposed method on illustrative settings providing visually interpretable insights, and apply our method to high-dimensional de-novo molecular design and low-energy conformer generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The sparse Mixture of Experts(MoE) architecture has evolved as a powerful approach for scaling deep learning models to more parameters with comparable computation cost. As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas. This survey seeks to fill these gaps. In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is currently the most comprehensive review in the field of MoE. We aim for this article to serve as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling them to navigate and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08026v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We analyse linear ensemble sampling (ES) with standard Gaussian perturbations in stochastic linear bandits. We show that for ensemble size $m=\Theta(d\log n)$, ES attains $\tilde O(d^{3/2}\sqrt n)$ high-probability regret, closing the gap to the Thompson sampling benchmark while keeping computation comparable. The proof brings a new perspective on randomized exploration in linear bandits by reducing the analysis to a time-uniform exceedance problem for $m$ independent Brownian motions. Intriguingly, this continuous-time lens is not forced; it appears natural--and perhaps necessary: the discrete-time problem seems to be asking for a continuous-time solution, and we know of no other way to obtain a sharp ES bound.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08032v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study diffusion-based world models for reinforcement learning, which offer high generative fidelity but face critical efficiency challenges in control. Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08033v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Should humans be asked to evaluate entities individually or comparatively? This question has been the subject of long debates. In this work, we show that, interestingly, combining both forms of preference elicitation can outperform the focus on a single kind. More specifically, we introduce SCoRa (Scoring from Comparisons and Ratings), a unified probabilistic model that allows to learn from both signals. We prove that the MAP estimator of SCoRa is well-behaved. It verifies monotonicity and robustness guarantees. We then empirically show that SCoRa recovers accurate scores, even under model mismatch. Most interestingly, we identify a realistic setting where combining comparisons and ratings outperforms using either one alone, and when the accurate ordering of top entities is critical. Given the de facto availability of signals of multiple forms, SCoRa additionally offers a versatile foundation for preference learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08036v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Continual Learning (GCL) aims to solve the challenges of streaming graph data. However, current methods often depend on replay-based strategies, which raise concerns like memory limits and privacy issues, while also struggling to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this paper, we suggest that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively guide the reasoning process of a fixed GNN backbone. Based on this idea, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM). The key component of TAAM is its lightweight Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs). For each new task, a dedicated NSM is trained and then frozen, acting as an "expert module." These modules perform detailed, node-attentive adaptive modulation on the computational flow of a shared GNN backbone. This setup ensures that new knowledge is kept within compact, task-specific modules, naturally preventing catastrophic forgetting without using any data replay. Additionally, to address the important challenge of unknown task IDs in real-world scenarios, we propose and theoretically prove a novel method named Anchored Multi-hop Propagation (AMP). Notably, we find that existing GCL benchmarks have flaws that can cause data leakage and biased evaluations. Therefore, we conduct all experiments in a more rigorous inductive learning scenario. Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods across eight datasets. Code and Datasets are available at: https://github.com/1iuJT/TAAM_AAMAS2026.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks trained on nonstationary data must balance stability (i.e., retaining prior knowledge) and plasticity (i.e., adapting to new tasks). Standard reinitialization methods, which reinitialize weights toward their original values, are widely used but difficult to tune: conservative reinitializations fail to restore plasticity, while aggressive ones erase useful knowledge. We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN). Across all domains, FIRE consistently outperforms both naive training without intervention and standard reinitialization methods, demonstrating effective balancing of the stability-plasticity tradeoff.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents for adversarial games is often driven by episodic objectives such as win rate. In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) is widely adopted to detect silent data corruptions (SDCs) in matrix multiplication, a cornerstone operation in deep learning systems. However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\times$ for BF16, representing a \textbf{6--48$\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\max} \approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \textbf{$\sim$1000$\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\max} \approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results. Our method requires only $O(n)$ complexity using max/min/mean statistics, compared to A-ABFT's $O(pn)$ for finding $p$ largest values. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions. V-ABFT is platform-agnostic and has been integrated into fault-tolerant GEMM implementations on both NPUs and GPUs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preserving interpretability in fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBS) is vital for water treatment, where decisions impact public health. While structural interpretability has been addressed using multi-objective algorithms, semantic interpretability often suffers due to fuzzy sets with low distinguishability. We propose a human-in-the-loop approach for developing interpretable FRBS to predict forward osmosis desalination productivity. Our method integrates expert-driven grid partitioning for distinguishable membership functions, domain-guided feature engineering to reduce redundancy, and rule pruning based on firing strength. This approach achieved comparable predictive performance to cluster-based FRBS while maintaining semantic interpretability and meeting structural complexity constraints, providing an explainable solution for water treatment applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08054v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a compelling paradigm for training autonomous systems without the risks of online exploration, particularly in safety-critical domains. However, jointly achieving strong safety and performance from fixed datasets remains challenging. Existing safe offline RL methods often rely on soft constraints that allow violations, introduce excessive conservatism, or struggle to balance safety, reward optimization, and adherence to the data distribution. To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling. Across various safety-critical tasks, including Safety-Gymnasium benchmarks, EpiFlow achieves competitive returns with near-zero empirical safety violations, demonstrating the effectiveness of epigraph-guided policy synthesis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM deployment on resource-constrained edge devices faces severe latency constraints, particularly in real-time applications where delayed responses can compromise safety or usability. Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths. The cost model predicts when speculative sampling and heterogeneous execution are jointly beneficial and is validated on an edge device featuring a hexacore Cortex-A CPU and a Mali GPU, revealing up to 1.68$\times$ speedup for translation tasks, closely matching analytic expectations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08062v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.   To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08063v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Wasserstein distance has emerged as a key metric to quantify distances between probability distributions, with applications in various fields, including machine learning, control theory, decision theory, and biological systems. Consequently, learning an unknown distribution with non-asymptotic and easy-to-compute error bounds in Wasserstein distance has become a fundamental problem in many fields. In this paper, we devise a novel algorithmic and theoretical framework to approximate an unknown probability distribution $\mathbb{P}$ from a finite set of samples by an approximate discrete distribution $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$ while bounding the Wasserstein distance between $\mathbb{P}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$. Our framework leverages optimal transport, nonlinear optimization, and concentration inequalities. In particular, we show that, even if $\mathbb{P}$ is unknown, the Wasserstein distance between $\mathbb{P}$ and $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$ can be efficiently bounded with high confidence by solving a tractable optimization problem (a mixed integer linear program) of a size that only depends on the size of the support of $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$. This enables us to develop intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally find the support of $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$ while minimizing the Wasserstein distance error. On a set of benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art comparable methods by generally returning approximating distributions with substantially smaller support and tighter error bounds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern Transformers predominantly adopt the Pre-Norm paradigm for its optimization stability, foregoing the superior potential of the unstable Post-Norm architecture. Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In real-world streaming recommender systems, user preferences evolve dynamically over time. Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Normative modeling learns a healthy reference distribution and quantifies subject-specific deviations to capture heterogeneous disease effects. In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of training objectives that prioritize reference-distribution fidelity and robust multimodal posterior aggregation for normative modeling, with implications for deviation-based analysis across multimodal clinical data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying autonomous agents in the wild requires reliable safeguards against tool use failures. We propose a training free guardrail based on spectral analysis of attention topology that complements supervised approaches. On Llama 3.1 8B, our method achieves 97.7\% recall with multi-feature detection and 86.1\% recall with 81.0\% precision for balanced deployment, without requiring any labeled training data. Most remarkably, we discover that single layer spectral features act as near-perfect hallucination detectors: Llama L26 Smoothness achieves 98.2\% recall (213/217 hallucinations caught) with a single threshold, and Mistral L3 Entropy achieves 94.7\% recall. This suggests hallucination is not merely a wrong token but a thermodynamic state change: the model's attention becomes noise when it errs. Through controlled cross-model evaluation on matched domains ($N=1000$, $T=0.3$, same General domain, hallucination rates 20--22\%), we reveal the ``Loud Liar'' phenomenon: Llama 3.1 8B's failures are spectrally catastrophic and dramatically easier to detect, while Mistral 7B achieves the best discrimination (AUC 0.900). These findings establish spectral analysis as a principled, efficient framework for agent safety.

Enhancing C-UAS with Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) can lead to more effective countermeasures. In this paper a scenario-based method is applied to C-UAS augmented with Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, that can enhance signal processing capabilities. Via the scenarios-based method we frame in this paper probability hacking as a challenge and identify requirements which can be implemented in existing Rule of Law mechanisms to prevent probability hacking. These requirements strengthen the trustworthiness of the C-UAS, which feed into justified trust - a key to successful Human-Autonomy Teaming, in civil and military contexts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs are typically fine-tuned offline on domain-specific data, assuming a static domain. In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline. These results demonstrate ODD 's robustness to evolving lexical and contextual patterns, making it suitable for dynamic LLM applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating the dimensionality of the latent representation needed for prediction -- the task-relevant dimension -- is a difficult, largely unsolved problem with broad scientific applications. We cast it as an Information Bottleneck question: what embedding bottleneck dimension is sufficient to compress predictor and predicted views while preserving their mutual information (MI). This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension. We extend the approach to intrinsic dimensionality by constructing paired views of a single dataset, enabling comparison with classical geometric dimension estimators. In noisy regimes where those estimators degrade, our approach remains reliable. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the method on multiple physics datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, where standard classifiers exhibit severe performance degradation in minority classes. Although existing approaches address imbalance through resampling or cost-sensitive learning during training, they require retraining or access to labeled target data when class distributions shift at deployment time, a common occurrence in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection. We present \textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and medical diagnosis benchmarks under simulated deployment shifts demonstrate that OBIL maintains robust performance under severe distribution shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in F1 Score when test distributions deviate significantly from the training conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08142v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning applications require fast and reliable per-sample uncertainty estimation. A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient. As a result, VGE provides a practical and scalable approach to epistemic-aware uncertainty estimation in ensemble models. An open-source implementation is available at: https://github.com/nextdevai/vge.

We show that a variant of NormalHedge enjoys a second-order $\epsilon$-quantile regret bound of $O\big(\sqrt{V_T \log(V_T/\epsilon)}\big) $ when $V_T > \log N$, where $V_T$ is the cumulative second moment of instantaneous per-expert regret averaged with respect to a natural distribution determined by the algorithm. The algorithm is motivated by a continuous time limit using Stochastic Differential Equations. The discrete time analysis uses self-concordance techniques.

We characterize the geometry of correctness representations across 9 models from 5 architecture families. The structure is simple: the discriminative signal occupies 3-8 dimensions, performance degrades with additional dimensions, and no nonlinear classifier improves over linear separation. Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy. We validate causally through activation steering: the learned direction produces 10.9 percentage point changes in error rates while random directions show no effect. Internal probes achieve 0.80-0.97 AUC; output-based methods (P(True), semantic entropy) achieve only 0.44-0.64 AUC. The correctness signal exists internally but is not expressed in outputs. That centroid distance matches probe performance indicates class separation is a mean shift, making detection geometric rather than learned.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08169v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference-time steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for controlling language models (LMs) without the cost of retraining. However, standard approaches typically rely on activation addition, a geometric operation that inevitably alters the magnitude of hidden representations. This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality. This work highlights the value of geometric consistency, suggesting that norm-preserving rotation is a robust and effective primitive for precise inference-time control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08171v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Randomized controlled trials estimate average treatment effects, but treatment response heterogeneity motivates personalized approaches. A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation. These results demonstrate that causal machine learning applications to clinical trials should include policy-level evaluation alongside heterogeneity testing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling time series with long- or short-memory characteristics is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. While fractional Brownian motion has been widely used as a noise source to capture such memory effects, its incompatibility with It\^o calculus limits its applicability in neural stochastic differential equation~(SDE) frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel class of noise, termed Neural Network-kernel ARMA-type noise~(NA-noise), which is an It\^o-process-based alternative capable of capturing both long- and short-memory behaviors. The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property. Based on this noise process, we develop NANSDE-Net, a generative model that extends Neural SDEs by incorporating NA-noise. We prove the theoretical existence and uniqueness of the solution under mild conditions and derive an efficient backpropagation scheme for training. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NANSDE-Net matches or outperforms existing models, including fractional SDE-Net, in reproducing long- and short-memory features of the data, while maintaining computational tractability within the It\^o calculus framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08194v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an ever-expanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, "dreaming" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08197v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid development of web services, large amounts of time series data are generated and accumulated across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and online platforms. As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time. To further demonstrate its practical value, we also present a case study using real-world data. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Higashiguchi-Shingo/KTVGL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08210v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Heatmap-based solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for Combinatorial Optimization (CO). However, we argue that the dominant Supervised Learning (SL) training paradigm suffers from a fundamental objective mismatch: minimizing imitation loss (e.g., cross-entropy) does not guarantee solution cost minimization. We dissect this mismatch into two deficiencies: Decoder-Blindness (being oblivious to the non-differentiable decoding process) and Cost-Blindness (prioritizing structural imitation over solution quality). We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation. CADO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, validating that objective alignment is essential for unlocking the full potential of heatmap-based solvers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecule generation and optimization is a fundamental task in chemical domain. The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery. Our code and model checkpoints are open-sourced to foster future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The solution of PDEs in decision-making tasks is increasingly being undertaken with the help of neural operator surrogate models due to the need for repeated evaluation. Such methods, while significantly more computationally favorable compared to their numerical counterparts, fail to provide any calibrated notions of uncertainty in their predictions. Current methods approach this deficiency typically with ensembling or Bayesian posterior estimation. However, these approaches either require distributional assumptions that fail to hold in practice or lack practical scalability, limiting their applications in practice. We, therefore, propose a novel application of conformal prediction to produce distribution-free uncertainty quantification over the function spaces mapped by neural operators. We then demonstrate how such prediction regions enable a formal regret characterization if leveraged in downstream robust decision-making tasks. We further demonstrate how such posited robust decision-making tasks can be efficiently solved using an infinite-dimensional generalization of Danskin's Theorem and calculus of variations and empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over more restrictive modeling paradigms, such as Gaussian Processes, across several engineering tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08216v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although the Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, its underlying mechanisms remain largely heuristic and lack a unified physical theory. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework for information dynamics, treating the attention mechanism as a physical system governed by the principle of least action rather than as an algorithmic optimization. By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat. Finally, we discuss how rotational symmetry breaking in the attention manifold generates massless Goldstone bosons, providing a field-theoretic perspective on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE). Our work connects Statistical Physics and Deep Learning, laying the groundwork for a general theory of physics-based intelligence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a sparsity-aware evolutionary (SAE) framework for model merging that involves iterative pruning-merging cycles to act as a novel mutation operator. We incorporate the sparsity constraints into the score function, which steers the evolutionary process to favor more sparse models, in addition to other conventional performance scores. Interestingly, the by-product of \textit{competition} for sparsity introduces an extra local \textit{attraction} and interplay into the evolutionary process: if one competitor has more zero elements, the other competitor's non-zero elements will occupy those positions, even though the less sparse competitor loses to the more sparse competitor in other positions. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a variety of large-scale LLM benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can improve model merging reliability across multiple benchmarks, and is easy to incorporate due to its simplicity and being orthogonal to most existing approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08234v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown stunning results in complex tasks, yet they often operate in isolation, failing to learn from past experiences. Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08239v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a popular class of techniques that strive to adapt large models in a scalable and resource-efficient manner. Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) leverages the in-context learning capabilities of transformer models (TMs) to efficiently generalize to unseen sequential decision-making tasks without parameter updates. However, existing ICRL methods rely on explicit reward signals during pretraining, which limits their applicability when rewards are ambiguous, hard to specify, or costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Auto-bidding systems aim to maximize marketing value while satisfying strict efficiency constraints such as Target Cost-Per-Action (CPA). Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of transformation inversion on general Lie groups: a datum is transformed by an unknown group element, and the goal is to recover an inverse transformation that maps it back to the original data distribution. Such unknown transformations arise widely in machine learning and scientific modeling, where they can significantly distort observations. We take a probabilistic view and model the posterior over transformations as a Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function on data space. To sample from this posterior, we introduce a diffusion process on Lie groups that keeps all updates on-manifold and only requires computations in the associated Lie algebra. Our method, Transformation-Inverting Energy Diffusion (TIED), relies on a new trivialized target-score identity that enables efficient score-based sampling of the transformation posterior. As a key application, we focus on test-time equivariance, where the objective is to improve the robustness of pretrained neural networks to input transformations. Experiments on image homographies and PDE symmetries demonstrate that TIED can restore transformed inputs to the training distribution at test time, showing improved performance over strong canonicalization and sampling baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling adaptive, task-specific optimizations through interactive feedback. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding simplicity biases in deep learning offers a promising path toward developing reliable AI. A common metric for this, inspired by Boolean function analysis, is average sensitivity, which captures a model's robustness to single-token perturbations. We argue that average sensitivity has two key limitations: it lacks a natural generalization to real-valued domains and fails to explain the "junta-like" input dependence we empirically observe in modern LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose noise stability as a more comprehensive simplicity metric. Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\%$ and $75\%$ respectively. Our results sculpt a new connection between signal propagation in neural networks and interpretability, with noise stability emerging as a powerful tool for understanding and improving modern Transformers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08290v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In federated learning (FL), decentralized model training allows multi-ple participants to collaboratively improve a shared machine learning model without exchanging raw data. However, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the system is challenging due to the presence of potentially malicious or faulty nodes that can degrade the model's performance. This paper proposes a novel trust-based incentive mechanism designed to evaluate and reward the quality of contributions in FL systems. By dynamically assessing trust scores based on fac-tors such as data quality, model accuracy, consistency, and contribution fre-quency, the system encourages honest participation and penalizes unreliable or malicious behavior. These trust scores form the basis of an incentive mechanism that rewards high-trust nodes with greater participation opportunities and penal-ties for low-trust participants. We further explore the integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the trust evaluation and incentive distribution processes, ensuring transparency and decentralization. Our proposed theoretical framework aims to create a more robust, fair, and transparent FL eco-system, reducing the risks posed by untrustworthy participants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Grokking, the phenomenon of delayed generalization, is often attributed to the depth and compositional structure of deep neural networks. We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Textual Gradient-style optimizers (TextGrad) enable gradient-like feedback propagation through compound AI systems. However, they do not work well for deep chains. The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components. Finally, it performs Density-Aware Optimization Scheduling to leverage the disentangled signals to dynamically allocate resources to key system bottlenecks. Our results show that TextResNet not only achieves superior performance compared to TextGrad, but also exhibits remarkable stability for agentic tasks in compound AI systems where baselines collapse.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we study Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL) [Xie et al., 2021], a paradigm designed for realistic scenarios where the learner receives indirect feedback generated by an unknown mechanism, rather than explicit numerical rewards. While prior work on IGL provides efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, those results are confined to single-step settings, restricting their applicability to modern sequential decision-making systems such as multi-turn Large Language Model (LLM) deployments. To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al. [2024a] from the single-step to the multi-step setting, addressing the unique challenges of decoding latent rewards under MDPs. Building on this estimator, we design an Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) algorithm for policy optimization. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning personalized objectives from multi-turn interactions through experiments on both a synthetic episodic MDP and a real-world user booking dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery methods require a large number of conditional independence (CI) tests, which severely limits their practical applicability due to high computational complexity. Therefore, it is crucial to design an algorithm that accelerates each individual test. To this end, we propose the Flow Matching-based Conditional Independence Test (FMCIT). The proposed test leverages the high computational efficiency of flow matching and requires the model to be trained only once throughout the entire causal discovery procedure, substantially accelerating causal discovery. According to numerical experiments, FMCIT effectively controls type-I error and maintains high testing power under the alternative hypothesis, even in the presence of high-dimensional conditioning sets. In addition, we further integrate FMCIT into a two-stage guided PC skeleton learning framework, termed GPC-FMCIT, which combines fast screening with guided, budgeted refinement using FMCIT. This design yields explicit bounds on the number of CI queries while maintaining high statistical power. Experiments on synthetic and real-world causal discovery tasks demonstrate favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs over existing CI testing methods and PC variants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08324v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning successfully enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it incurs substantial computational overhead for inference. Existing CoT compression methods often suffer from a critical loss of logical fidelity at high compression ratios, resulting in significant performance degradation. To achieve high-fidelity, fast reasoning, we propose a novel EXTreme-RAtio Chain-of-Thought Compression framework, termed Extra-CoT, which aggressively reduces the token budget while preserving answer accuracy. To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations. An LLM is then fine-tuned on these compressed pairs via a mixed-ratio supervised fine-tuning (SFT), teaching it to follow a spectrum of compression budgets and providing a stable initialization for reinforcement learning (RL). We further propose Constrained and Hierarchical Ratio Policy Optimization (CHRPO) to explicitly incentivize question-solving ability under lower budgets by a hierarchical reward. Experiments on three mathematical reasoning benchmarks show the superiority of Extra-CoT. For example, on MATH-500 using Qwen3-1.7B, Extra-CoT achieves over 73\% token reduction with an accuracy improvement of 0.6\%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A core bottleneck in large language model (LLM) inference is the cost of attending over the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the empirical success of DNN, their internal training dynamics remain difficult to characterize. In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks. For reproducibility, code and experiment configurations will be released upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08343v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-context inference is constrained by KV-cache memory, which grows linearly with sequence length; KV-cache compression therefore hinges on reliably selecting which past tokens to retain. Most geometry-based eviction methods score keys by cosine similarity to a global centroid, but cosine is scale-invariant and can discard magnitude cues that distinguish semantically salient tokens. We propose ManifoldKV, a training-free scorer that ranks tokens by Euclidean distance to the key centroid, capturing both angular and radial deviations.   On the RULER benchmark, ManifoldKV achieves 95.7% accuracy at 4K-16K contexts with 20% compression; matching the best geometric baseline while improving robustness in two regimes where cosine scoring fails. First, on multi-key retrieval, ManifoldKV reduces directional collisions, achieving 92.4% vs KeyDiff's 77.0% (+15.4 points) on 3-key NIAH at 50% compression. Second, to address dilution and performance collapse of global centroids at 64K context, we introduce WindowedManifoldKV, which restores accuracy to 84.3% at 25% compression, a 49-point recovery over global L2 and +3.2 points over KeyDiff. The method requires only 3 lines of code and works across 4 architectures without tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08350v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the best-case Empirical Risk Minimizer in the setting of stochastic convex optimization. We show that there exists an instance in which the sample size is linear in the dimension, learning is possible, but the Empirical Risk Minimizer is likely to be unique and to overfit. This resolves an open question by Feldman. We also extend this to approximate ERMs.   Building on our construction we also show that (constrained) Gradient Descent potentially overfits when horizon and learning rate grow w.r.t sample size. Specifically we provide a novel generalization lower bound of $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\eta T/m^{1.5}}\right)$ for Gradient Descent, where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $T$ is the horizon and $m$ is the sample size. This narrows down, exponentially, the gap between the best known upper bound of $O(\eta T/m)$ and existing lower bounds from previous constructions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08351v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Co-optimizing data and model configurations for training LLMs presents a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma: The best training data configuration (e.g., data mixture) for a downstream task depends on the chosen model configuration (e.g., model architecture), and vice versa. However, jointly optimizing both data and model configurations is often deemed intractable, and existing methods focus on either data or model optimization without considering their interaction. We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08372v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study dynamic regret minimization in non-stationary online learning, with a primary focus on follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) methods. FTRL is important for curved losses and for understanding adaptive optimizers such as Adam, yet existing dynamic regret analyses are less explored for FTRL. To address this, we build on the discounted-to-dynamic reduction and present a modular way to obtain dynamic regret bounds of FTRL-related problems. Specifically, we focus on two representative curved losses: linear regression and logistic regression. Our method not only simplifies existing proofs for the optimal dynamic regret of online linear regression, but also yields new dynamic regret guarantees for online logistic regression. Beyond online convex optimization, we apply the reduction to analyze the Adam optimizers, obtaining optimal convergence rates in stochastic, non-convex, and non-smooth settings. The reduction also enables a more detailed treatment of Adam with two discount parameters $(\beta_1,\beta_2)$, leading to new results for both clipped and clip-free variants of Adam optimizers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08376v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely used to compress large language models without retraining. However, many existing weight-only methods rely on heuristic objectives and greedy rounding, thus leading to noticeable degradation under low-bit quantization. In this work, we introduce OJBKQ (Objective-Joint Babai-Klein Quantization with K-Best Sampling), a layer-wise PTQ method that formulates weight quantization as a joint optimization problem over activations and weights. This formulation results in a multiple-right-hand-side box-constrained integer least squares (BILS) problem in each layer, which is NP-hard. For each column of the weight matrix, we apply an extended Babai nearest-plane algorithm and an extended version of Klein's randomized Babai algorithm to find the minimum-residual Babai-Klein point, a sub-optimal solution to the BILS problem. Experimental results on large language models show that OJBKQ achieves lower perplexity at 3-4 bits compared to existing PTQ approaches, while maintaining comparable computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08377v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Addressing the critical need for robust safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly against adversarial attacks and in-distribution errors, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Backtracking Feedback (RLBF). This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient "backtrack by x tokens" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08387v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Today's LLM (pre-) training and research workflows typically allocate a significant amount of compute to large-scale ablation studies. Despite the substantial compute costs of these ablations, existing open-source frameworks provide limited tooling for these experiments, often forcing researchers to write their own wrappers and scripts. We propose Modalities, an end-to-end PyTorch-native framework that integrates data-driven LLM research with large-scale model training from two angles. Firstly, by integrating state-of-the-art parallelization strategies, it enables both efficient pretraining and systematic ablations at trillion-token and billion-parameter scale. Secondly, Modalities adopts modular design with declarative, self-contained configuration, enabling reproducibility and extensibility levels that are difficult to achieve out-of-the-box with existing LLM training frameworks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08407v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Exploring missing data in attributed graphs introduces unique challenges beyond those found in tabular datasets. In this work, we extend the taxonomy for missing data mechanisms to attributed graphs by proposing GAMM (Graph Attributes Missing Mechanisms), a framework that systematically links missingness probability to both node attributes and the underlying graph structure. Our taxonomy enriches the conventional definitions of masking mechanisms by introducing graph-specific dependencies. We empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art imputation methods, while effective on traditional masks, significantly struggle when confronted with these more realistic graph-aware missingness scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08419v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Radial singular fields, such as $1/r$, $\log r$, and crack-tip profiles, are difficult to model for coordinate-separable neural architectures. We show that any $C^2$ function that is both radial and additively separable must be quadratic, establishing a fundamental obstruction for coordinate-wise power-law models. Motivated by this result, we introduce Radial M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks (RMN), which represent fields as linear combinations of learnable radial powers $r^\mu$, including negative exponents, together with a limit-stable log-primitive for exact $\log r$ behavior. RMN admits closed-form spatial gradients and Laplacians, enabling physics-informed learning on punctured domains. Across ten 2D and 3D benchmarks, RMN achieves 1.5$\times$--51$\times$ lower RMSE than MLPs and 10$\times$--100$\times$ lower RMSE than SIREN while using 27 parameters, compared with 33,537 for MLPs and 8,577 for SIREN. We extend RMN to angular dependence (RMN-Angular) and to multiple sources with learnable centers (RMN-MC); when optimization converges, source-center recovery errors fall below $10^{-4}$. We also report controlled failures on smooth, strongly non-radial targets to delineate RMN's operating regime.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08427v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI has impacted many disciplines and is nowadays ubiquitous. In particular, spatial statistics is in a pivotal moment where it will increasingly intertwine with AI. In this scenario, a relevant question is what relationship spatial statistics models have with machine learning (ML) models, if any. In particular, in this paper, we explore the connections between Kriging and neural networks. At first glance, they may appear unrelated. Kriging - and its ML counterpart, Gaussian process regression - are grounded in probability theory and stochastic processes, whereas many ML models are extensively considered Black-Box models. Nevertheless, they are strongly related. We study their connections and revisit the relevant literature. The understanding of their relations and the combination of both perspectives may enhance ML techniques by making them more interpretable, reliable, and spatially aware.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08431v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: SF-GDA is pivotal for privacy-preserving knowledge transfer across graph datasets. Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm widely adopted in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Previous work on causal inference has primarily focused on averages and conditional averages of treatment effects, with significantly less attention on variability and uncertainty in individual treatment responses. In this paper, we introduce the variance of the treatment effect (VTE) and conditional variance of treatment effect (CVTE) as the natural measure of aleatoric uncertainty inherent in treatment responses, and we demonstrate that these quantities are identifiable from observed data under mild assumptions, even in the presence of unobserved confounders. We further propose nonparametric kernel-based estimators for VTE and CVTE, and our theoretical analysis establishes their convergence. We also test the performance of our method through extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic and semi-simulated datasets, where it demonstrates superior or comparable performance to naive baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08467v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly diagnosis, which encompasses both anomaly detection and localization, is critical for the safety and reliability of complex, large-scale real-world systems. The vast majority of existing anomaly diagnosis methods offer limited theoretical insights, especially for anomaly localization, which is a vital but largely unexplored area. The aim of this contribution is to study the learning process of a Transformer when applied to MTS by revealing connections to statistical time series methods. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Attention Low-Rank Transformer (ALoRa-T) model, which applies low-rank regularization to self-attention, and we introduce the Attention Low-Rank score, effectively capturing the temporal characteristics of anomalies. Finally, to enable anomaly localization, we propose the ALoRa-Loc method, a novel approach that associates anomalies to specific variables by quantifying interrelationships among time series. Extensive experiments and real data analysis, show that the proposed methodology significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08470v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Credal predictors are models that are aware of epistemic uncertainty and produce a convex set of probabilistic predictions. They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings. However, most state-of-the-art methods mainly define EU as disagreement caused by random training initializations, which mostly reflects sensitivity to optimization randomness rather than uncertainty from deeper sources. To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose the time-delayed transformer (TD-TF), a simplified transformer architecture for data-driven modeling of unsteady spatio-temporal dynamics. TD-TF bridges linear operator-based methods and deep sequence models by showing that a single-layer, single-head transformer can be interpreted as a nonlinear generalization of time-delayed dynamic mode decomposition (TD-DMD). The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics. Validation studies on synthetic signals, unsteady aerodynamics, the Lorenz '63 system, and a reaction-diffusion model show that TD-TF preserves the interpretability and efficiency of linear models while providing substantially enhanced expressive power for complex dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08489v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08499v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is an effective paradigm for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing RLVR methods utilize rollouts in an indiscriminate and short-horizon manner: responses of heterogeneous quality within each prompt are treated uniformly, and historical rollouts are discarded after a single use. This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound. Experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in performance and training efficiency across multiple RLVR optimization methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08500v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attributed Graph Clustering (AGC) is a fundamental unsupervised task that integrates structural topology and node attributes to uncover latent patterns in graph-structured data. Despite its significance in industrial applications such as fraud detection and user segmentation, a significant chasm persists between academic research and real-world deployment. Current evaluation protocols suffer from the small-scale, high-homophily citation datasets, non-scalable full-batch training paradigms, and a reliance on supervised metrics that fail to reflect performance in label-scarce environments. To bridge these gaps, we present PyAGC, a comprehensive, production-ready benchmark and library designed to stress-test AGC methods across diverse scales and structural properties. We unify existing methodologies into a modular Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework and, for the first time, provide memory-efficient, mini-batch implementations for a wide array of state-of-the-art AGC algorithms. Our benchmark curates 12 diverse datasets, ranging from 2.7K to 111M nodes, specifically incorporating industrial graphs with complex tabular features and low homophily. Furthermore, we advocate for a holistic evaluation protocol that mandates unsupervised structural metrics and efficiency profiling alongside traditional supervised metrics. Battle-tested in high-stakes industrial workflows at Ant Group, this benchmark offers the community a robust, reproducible, and scalable platform to advance AGC research towards realistic deployment. The code and resources are publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/Cloudy1225/PyAGC), PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pyagc), and Documentation (https://pyagc.readthedocs.io).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative modeling typically seeks the path of least action via deterministic flows (ODE). While effective for in-distribution tasks, we argue that these deterministic paths become brittle under causal interventions, which often require transporting probability mass across low-density regions ("off-manifold") where the vector field is ill-defined. This leads to numerical instability and spurious correlations. In this work, we introduce the Causal Schr\"odinger Bridge (CSB), a framework that reformulates counterfactual inference as Entropic Optimal Transport. Unlike deterministic approaches that require strict invertibility, CSB leverages diffusion processes (SDEs) to robustly "tunnel" through support mismatches while strictly enforcing structural admissibility constraints. We prove the Structural Decomposition Theorem, showing that the global high-dimensional bridge factorizes into local, robust transitions. Empirical validation on high-dimensional interventions (Morpho-MNIST) demonstrates that CSB significantly outperforms deterministic baselines in structural consistency, particularly in regimes of strong, out-of-distribution treatments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08552v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Subjective ratings contain inherent noise that limits the model-human correlation, but this reliability issue is rarely quantified. In this paper, we present $\rho$-Perfect, a practical estimation of the highest achievable correlation of a model on subjectively rated datasets. We define $\rho$-Perfect to be the correlation between a perfect predictor and human ratings, and derive an estimate of the value based on heteroscedastic noise scenarios, a common occurrence in subjectively rated datasets. We show that $\rho$-Perfect squared estimates test-retest correlation and use this to validate the estimate. We demonstrate the use of $\rho$-Perfect on a speech quality dataset and show how the measure can distinguish between model limitations and data quality issues.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08563v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly treated as stateless: once an interaction ends, no information is assumed to persist unless it is explicitly stored and re-supplied. We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments. To promote future research, we release code and data at: https://github.com/microsoft/implicitMemory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training of large-scale models is both computationally intensive and often constrained by the availability of labeled data. Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear regression analysis focuses on predicting a numeric regressand value based on certain regressor values. In this context, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a common non-parametric regression algorithm, which achieves efficient performance when compared with other algorithms in literature. In this research effort an optimization of the k-NN algorithm is proposed by exploiting the potentiality of an introduced arithmetic method, which can provide solutions for linear equations involving an arbitrary number of real variables. Specifically, an Arithmetic Method Algorithm (AMA) is adopted to assess the efficiency of the introduced arithmetic method, while an Arithmetic Method Regression (AMR) algorithm is proposed as an optimization of k-NN adopting the potentiality of AMA. Such algorithm is compared with other regression algorithms, according to an introduced optimal inference decision rule, and evaluated on certain real world data sources, which are publicly available. Results are promising since the proposed AMR algorithm has comparable performance with the other algorithms, while in most cases it achieves better performance than the k-NN. The output results indicate that introduced AMR is an optimization of k-NN.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08579v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) by treating the score estimation error as a stochastic source driving the Fokker-Planck equation. Departing from particle-centric SDE analyses, we employ an SPDE framework to model the evolution of the probability density field under stochastic drift perturbations. Under a simplified setting, we utilize this framework to interpret the robustness of generative models through the lens of geometric stability and displacement convexity. Furthermore, we introduce a candidate evaluation metric derived from the quadratic variation of the SPDE solution projected onto a radial test function. Preliminary observations suggest that this metric remains effective using only the initial 10% of the sampling trajectory, indicating a potential for computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from a fixed dataset while maximizing performance under cumulative cost constraints. In practice, deployment requirements often vary across scenarios, necessitating a single policy that can adapt zero-shot to different cost thresholds. However, most existing offline safe RL methods are trained under a pre-specified threshold, yielding policies with limited generalization and deployment flexibility across cost thresholds. Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated. Extensive experiments on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that RCDT consistently improves return--cost trade-offs over representative baselines, advancing the state-of-the-art in offline safe RL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given the quadratic complexity of attention, KV cache eviction is vital to accelerate model inference. Current KV cache eviction methods typically rely on instantaneous heuristic metrics, implicitly assuming that score magnitudes are consistent proxies for importance across all heads. However, this overlooks the heterogeneity in predictive fidelity across attention heads. While certain heads prioritize the instantaneous contribution of tokens, others are dedicated to capturing long-horizon utility. In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision. Furthermore, we implement a data-driven offline profiling protocol to facilitate the practical deployment of LU-KV. Extensive evaluations on LongBench and RULER benchmarks demonstrate that LU-KV achieves an 80% reduction in KV cache size with minimal performance degradation, while simultaneously reducing inference latency and GPU memory footprint.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08589v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: PageRank (PR) is a fundamental algorithm in graph machine learning tasks. Owing to the increasing importance of algorithmic fairness, we consider the problem of computing PR vectors subject to various group-fairness criteria based on sensitive attributes of the vertices. At present, principled algorithms for this problem are lacking - some cannot guarantee that a target fairness level is achieved, while others do not feature optimality guarantees. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets showcase that FairRARI outperforms existing methods in terms of utility, while achieving the desired fairness levels across multiple vertex groups; thereby highlighting its effectiveness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08590v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language pretrained models offer strong transferable representations, yet adapting them in privacy-sensitive multi-party settings is challenging due to the high communication cost of federated optimization and the limited local data on clients. Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08592v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with widespread applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, knowledge graphs, etc. In the foundation model era, how to develop universal link prediction methods across datasets and domains becomes a key problem, with some initial attempts adopting Graph Foundation Models utilizing Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models. However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning. Experiments on 6 graph benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines without requiring dataset-specific finetuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is increasingly applied to logistics, scheduling, and recommender systems, but standard algorithms struggle with the curse of dimensionality in such large discrete action spaces. Existing algorithms typically rely on restrictive grid-based structures or computationally expensive nearest-neighbor searches, limiting their effectiveness in high-dimensional or irregularly structured domains. We propose Distance-Guided Reinforcement Learning (DGRL), combining Sampled Dynamic Neighborhoods (SDN) and Distance-Based Updates (DBU) to enable efficient RL in spaces with up to 10$^\text{20}$ actions. Unlike prior methods, SDN leverages a semantic embedding space to perform stochastic volumetric exploration, provably providing full support over a local trust region. Complementing this, DBU transforms policy optimization into a stable regression task, decoupling gradient variance from action space cardinality and guaranteeing monotonic policy improvement. DGRL naturally generalizes to hybrid continuous-discrete action spaces without requiring hierarchical dependencies. We demonstrate performance improvements of up to 66% against state-of-the-art benchmarks across regularly and irregularly structured environments, while simultaneously improving convergence speed and computational complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling federated learning (FL) to billion-parameter models introduces critical trade-offs between communication efficiency, model accuracy, and privacy guarantees. Existing solutions often tackle these challenges in isolation, sacrificing accuracy or relying on costly cryptographic tools. We propose ERIS, a serverless FL framework that balances privacy and accuracy while eliminating the server bottleneck and distributing the communication load. ERIS combines a model partitioning strategy, distributing aggregation across multiple client-side aggregators, with a distributed shifted gradient compression mechanism. We theoretically prove that ERIS (i) converges at the same rate as FedAvg under standard assumptions, and (ii) bounds mutual information leakage inversely with the number of aggregators, enabling strong privacy guarantees with no accuracy degradation. Experiments across image and text tasks, including large language models, confirm that ERIS achieves FedAvg-level accuracy while substantially reducing communication cost and improving robustness to membership inference and reconstruction attacks, without relying on heavy cryptography or noise injection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08621v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: By introducing routers to selectively activate experts in Transformer layers, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture significantly reduces computational costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining competitive performance, especially for models with massive parameters. However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08629v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Causal discovery is essential for advancing data-driven fields such as scientific AI and data analysis, yet existing approaches face significant time- and space-efficiency bottlenecks when scaling to large graphs. To address this challenge, we present CauScale, a neural architecture designed for efficient causal discovery that scales inference to graphs with up to 1000 nodes. CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08638v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As a fundamental data mining task, unsupervised time series anomaly detection (TSAD) aims to build a model for identifying abnormal timestamps without assuming the availability of annotations. A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08646v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a constrained latent optimization method for reward-guided generation that preserves white Gaussian noise characteristics with negligible overhead. Test-time latent optimization can unlock substantially better reward-guided generations from pretrained generative models, but it is prone to reward hacking that degrades quality and also too slow for practical use. In this work, we make test-time optimization both efficient and reliable by replacing soft regularization with hard white Gaussian noise constraints enforced via projected gradient ascent. Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time. In experiments, our approach reaches a comparable Aesthetic Score using only 30% of the wall-clock time required by the SOTA regularization-based method, while preventing reward hacking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08655v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises the recovery of optimal policies from static datasets, yet it remains susceptible to the overestimation of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, particularly in fractured and sparse data manifolds.Current solutions necessitates a trade off between computational efficiency and performance. Methods like CQL offers rigorous conservatism but require tremendous compute power while efficient expectile-based methods like IQL often fail to correct OOD errors on pathological datasets, collapsing to Behavioural Cloning. In this work, we propose Geometric Pessimism, a modular, compute-efficient framework that augments standard IQL with density-based penalty derived from k-nearest-neighbour distances in the state-action embedding space. By pre-computing the penalties applied to each state-action pair our method injects OOD conservatism via reward shaping with a O(1) training overhead. Evaluated on the D4Rl MuJoCo benchmark, our method, Geo-IQL outperforms standard IQL on sensitive and unstable medium-replay tasks by over 18 points, while reducing inter-seed variance by 4x. Furthermore, Geo-IQL does not degrade performance on stable manifolds. Crucially, we validate our algorithm on the MIMIC-III Sepsis critical care dataset. While standard IQL collapses to behaviour cloning, Geo-IQL demonstrates active policy improvement. Maintaining safety constraints, achieving 86.4% terminal agreement with clinicians compared to IQL's 75%. Our results suggest that geometric pessimism provides the necessary regularisation to safely overcome local optima in critical, real-world decision systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08657v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic data have gained increasing attention across various domains, with a growing emphasis on their performance in downstream prediction tasks. However, most existing synthesis strategies focus on maintaining statistical information. Although some studies address prediction performance guarantees, their single-stage synthesis designs make it challenging to balance the privacy requirements that necessitate significant perturbations and the prediction performance that is sensitive to such perturbations. We propose a two-stage synthesis strategy. In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance. We validate our approach and demonstrate its characteristics of being statistics-driven and restricted in achieving the privacy--prediction trade-off both theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we showcase its generalizability through applications to a marketing problem and five real-world datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08660v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fairness is a crucial concern for generative models, which not only reflect but can also amplify societal and cultural biases. Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT. We validate this theoretical insight through a set of experiments on both image and text generation tasks. We demonstrate that min-max methods consistently achieve fairer outcomes compared to other approaches from the literature, while maintaining competitive overall performance for both tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08676v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While LLaDA2.0 showcased the scaling potential of 100B-level block-diffusion models and their inherent parallelization, the delicate equilibrium between decoding speed and generation quality has remained an elusive frontier. Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed. Despite its 100B volume, on coding tasks it attains an astounding 892 TPS on HumanEval+, 801 TPS on BigCodeBench, and 663 TPS on LiveCodeBench.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Score-based query attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning models by crafting adversarial examples (AEs) using only black-box access to model output scores, iteratively optimizing inputs based on observed loss values. While recent runtime defenses attempt to disrupt this process via output perturbation, most either require access to model parameters or fail when attackers adapt their tactics. In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08681v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In many safety-critical settings, probabilistic ML systems have to make predictions subject to algebraic constraints, e.g., predicting the most likely trajectory that does not cross obstacles.   These real-world constraints are rarely convex, nor the densities considered are (log-)concave.   This makes computing this constrained maximum a posteriori (MAP) prediction efficiently and reliably extremely challenging.   In this paper, we first investigate under which conditions we can perform constrained MAP inference over continuous variables exactly and efficiently and devise a scalable message-passing algorithm for this tractable fragment.   Then, we devise a general constrained MAP strategy that interleaves partitioning the domain into convex feasible regions with numerical constrained optimization.   We evaluate both methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing our %   approaches outperform constraint-agnostic baselines, and scale to complex densities intractable for SoTA exact solvers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios are severely constrained by the linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache memory. Existing KV compression methods rely either on static thresholds and attention-only heuristics or on coarse memory budget allocation. Under tight memory budgets, these methods overlook two key factors: prompt-dependent variation in compression risk and functional heterogeneity across attention heads, which destabilize token selection and lead to tail failures. To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds. Experiments on LongBench show CompilerKV dominates SOTA methods under a 512-token budget, recovering 97.7\% of FullKV performance while achieving up to +5.2 points gain over the strongest competitor.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08689v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models generate samples through an iterative denoising process, guided by a neural network. While training the denoiser on real-world data is computationally demanding, the sampling procedure itself is more flexible. This adaptability serves as a key lever in practice, enabling improvements in both the quality of generated samples and the efficiency of the sampling process. In this work, we introduce an inverse reinforcement learning framework for learning sampling strategies without retraining the denoiser. We formulate the diffusion sampling procedure as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where actions correspond to optional modifications of the sampling dynamics. To optimize action scheduling, we avoid defining an explicit reward function. Instead, we directly match the target behavior expected from the sampler using policy gradient techniques. We provide experimental evidence that this approach can improve the quality of samples generated by pretrained diffusion models and automatically tune sampling hyperparameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08690v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in domains requiring sequential decision-making, motivating its application to cybersecurity problems. However, transitioning DRL from laboratory simulations to bespoke cyber environments can introduce numerous issues. This is further exacerbated by the often adversarial, non-stationary, and partially-observable nature of most cybersecurity tasks. In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for each pitfall to support the development of more rigorous and deployable DRL-based security systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Do language models make decisions under uncertainty like humans do, and what role does chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning play in the underlying decision process? We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Noise is ubiquitous in data used to train large language models, but it is not well understood whether these models are able to correctly generalize to inputs generated without noise. Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions. Overall, we find that transformers are particularly ineffective for learning boolean functions in the presence of feature noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present QUOKA: Query-oriented KV selection for efficient attention, a training-free and hardware agnostic sparse attention algorithm for accelerating transformer inference under chunked prefill. While many queries focus on a smaller group of keys in the attention operator, we observe that queries with low cosine similarity with respect to the mean query interact more strongly with more keys and have the greatest contribution to final attention logits. By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries. Through experiments on Needle-In-A-Haystack, LongBench, RULER, and Math500, we show that, while realizing a 3x reduction in time-to-first-token, 5x speedup in attention on Nvidia GPUs and up to nearly a 7x speedup on Intel Xeon CPUs, QUOKA achieves near-baseline accuracy, utilizing 88% fewer key-value pairs per attention evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training data reconstruction from KKT conditions has shown striking empirical success, yet it remains unclear when the resulting KKT equations have unique solutions and, even in identifiable regimes, how to reliably recover solutions by optimization. This work hereby focuses on these two complementary questions: identifiability and optimization. On the identifiability side, we discuss the sufficient conditions for KKT system of two-layer networks with polynomial activations to uniquely determine the training data, providing a theoretical explanation of when and why reconstruction is possible. On the optimization side, we introduce sample splitting, a curvature-aware refinement step applicable to general reconstruction objectives (not limited to KKT-based formulations): it creates additional descent directions to escape poor stationary points and refine solutions. Experiments demonstrate that augmenting several existing reconstruction methods with sample splitting consistently improves reconstruction performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08733v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are central to scientific modelling, but inferring their vector fields from noisy trajectories remains challenging. Current approaches such as symbolic regression, Gaussian process (GP) regression, and Neural ODEs often require complex training pipelines and substantial machine learning expertise, or they depend strongly on system-specific prior knowledge. We propose FIM-ODE, a pretrained Foundation Inference Model that amortises low-dimensional ODE inference by predicting the vector field directly from noisy trajectory data in a single forward pass. We pretrain FIM-ODE on a prior distribution over ODEs with low-degree polynomial vector fields and represent the target field with neural operators. FIM-ODE achieves strong zero-shot performance, matching and often improving upon ODEFormer, a recent pretrained symbolic baseline, across a range of regimes despite using a simpler pretraining prior distribution. Pretraining also provides a strong initialisation for finetuning, enabling fast and stable adaptation that outperforms modern neural and GP baselines without requiring machine learning expertise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08745v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning approaches to solving Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) aim to replace handcrafted heuristics with learning-based models. Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the main architecture for SAT solving, due to the natural graph representation of Boolean formulas. We analyze the expressive power of GNNs for SAT solving through the lens of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test. As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current biological AI models lack interpretability -- their internal representations do not correspond to biological relationships that   researchers can examine. Here we present CDT-II, an "AI microscope" whose attention maps are directly interpretable as regulatory structure.   By mirroring the central dogma in its architecture, each attention mechanism corresponds to a specific biological relationship: DNA   self-attention for genomic relationships, RNA self-attention for gene co-regulation, and DNA-to-RNA cross-attention for transcriptional   control. Using only genomic embeddings and raw per-cell expression, CDT-II enables experimental biologists to observe regulatory networks in   their own data. Applied to K562 CRISPRi data, CDT-II predicts perturbation effects (per-gene mean $r = 0.84$) and recovers the GFI1B   regulatory network without supervision (6.6-fold enrichment, $P = 3.5 \times 10^{-17}$). Two distinct attention mechanisms converge on an RNA   processing module ($P = 1 \times 10^{-16}$). CDT-II establishes mechanism-oriented AI as an alternative to task-oriented approaches, revealing   regulatory structure rather than merely optimizing predictions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08755v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal multiview learning seeks to integrate information from diverse sources to enhance task performance. Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space. RALIS is validated on four datasets encompassing inertial and human pose modalities, with the number of views ranging from three to nine, demonstrating its performance and flexibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08762v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various graph-based machine learning tasks by effectively modeling high-order interactions between nodes. However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08768v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting models often lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in domains requiring explainable predictions. We propose \textsc{FreqLens}, an interpretable forecasting framework that discovers and attributes predictions to learnable frequency components. \textsc{FreqLens} introduces two key innovations: (1) \emph{learnable frequency discovery} -- frequency bases are parameterized via sigmoid mapping and learned from data with diversity regularization, enabling automatic discovery of dominant periodic patterns without domain knowledge; and (2) \emph{axiomatic frequency attribution} -- a theoretically grounded framework that provably satisfies Completeness, Faithfulness, Null-Frequency, and Symmetry axioms, with per-frequency attributions equivalent to Shapley values. On Traffic and Weather datasets, \textsc{FreqLens} achieves competitive or superior performance while discovering physically meaningful frequencies: all 5 independent runs discover the 24-hour daily cycle ($24.6 \pm 0.1$h, 2.5\% error) and 12-hour half-daily cycle ($11.8 \pm 0.1$h, 1.6\% error) on Traffic, and weekly cycles ($10\times$ longer than the input window) on Weather. These results demonstrate genuine frequency-level knowledge discovery with formal theoretical guarantees on attribution quality.

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalization and approximation capabilities of message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) are often studied by defining a compact metric on a space of input graphs under which MPNNs are H\"older continuous. Such analyses are of two varieties: 1) when the metric space includes graphs of unbounded sizes, the theory is only appropriate for dense graphs, and, 2) when studying sparse graphs, the metric space only includes graphs of uniformly bounded size. In this work, we present a unified approach, defining a compact metric on the space of graphs of all sizes, both sparse and dense, under which MPNNs are H\"older continuous. This leads to more powerful universal approximation theorems and generalization bounds than previous works. The theory is based on, and extends, a recent approach to graph limit theory called graphop analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating step-by-step "how-to" procedures is a key LLM capability: how-to advice is commonly requested in chatbots, and step-by-step planning is critical for reasoning over complex tasks. Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08809v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, whether on discriminative or generative tasks have been beneficial for various applications, among which security and defense. However, their increasing computational demands during training and deployment translates directly into high energy consumption. As a consequence, this induces a heavy carbon footprint which hinders their widespread use and scalability, but also a limitation when deployed on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time use. In this paper, we briefly survey efficient deep learning methods for biometric applications. Specifically, we tackle the challenges one might incur when training and deploying deep learning approaches, and provide a taxonomy of the various efficient deep learning families. Additionally, we discuss complementary metrics for evaluating the efficiency of these models such as memory, computation, latency, throughput, and advocate for universal and reproducible metrics for better comparison. Last, we give future research directions to consider.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08810v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) provide a structured approach to sequence modeling that bridges classical linear dynamical systems and modern deep learning, offering both expressive power and theoretical guarantees on stability and trainability. In recent years, multiple LRNN-based architectures have been proposed, each introducing distinct parameterizations, discretization schemes, and implementation constraints. However, existing implementations are fragmented across different software frameworks, often rely on framework-specific optimizations, and in some cases require custom CUDA kernels or lack publicly available code altogether. As a result, using, comparing, or extending LRNNs requires substantial implementation effort. To address this, we introduce $\texttt{lrnnx}$, a unified software library that implements several modern LRNN architectures under a common interface. The library exposes multiple levels of control, allowing users to work directly with core components or higher-level model abstractions. $\texttt{lrnnx}$ aims to improve accessibility, reproducibility, and extensibility of LRNN research and applications. We make our code available under a permissive MIT license.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained through multi-stage post-training: first via RLHF, then fine-tuned for other downstream objectives. Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.   We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08816v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Permissive licenses like MIT, Apache-2.0, and BSD-3-Clause dominate open-source AI, signaling that artifacts like models, datasets, and code can be freely used, modified, and redistributed. However, these licenses carry mandatory requirements: include the full license text, provide a copyright notice, and preserve upstream attribution, that remain unverified at scale. Failure to meet these conditions can place reuse outside the scope of the license, effectively leaving AI artifacts under default copyright for those uses and exposing downstream users to litigation. We call this phenomenon ``permissive washing'': labeling AI artifacts as free to use, while omitting the legal documentation required to make that label actionable. To assess how widespread permissive washing is in the AI supply chain, we empirically audit 124,278 dataset $\rightarrow$ model $\rightarrow$ application supply chains, spanning 3,338 datasets, 6,664 models, and 28,516 applications across Hugging Face and GitHub. We find that an astonishing 96.5\% of datasets and 95.8\% of models lack the required license text, only 2.3\% of datasets and 3.2\% of models satisfy both license text and copyright requirements, and even when upstream artifacts provide complete licensing evidence, attribution rarely propagates downstream: only 27.59\% of models preserve compliant dataset notices and only 5.75\% of applications preserve compliant model notices (with just 6.38\% preserving any linked upstream notice). Practitioners cannot assume permissive labels confer the rights they claim: license files and notices, not metadata, are the source of legal truth. To support future research, we release our full audit dataset and reproducible pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08817v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), demonstrate powerful inference capabilities but consume substantial energy. Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Kirin, under a W4A4\&8 quantization setting, achieves near-FP16 accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 84.66\% and shortening time steps by 93.75\%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in mixture-of-experts architectures have shown that individual experts models can be trained federatedly, i.e., in isolation from other experts by using a common base model to facilitate coordination. However, we hypothesize that full-sized experts may not be necessary for all domains and that instead low-rank adapters may be sufficient. Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks. For our experiments, we build on FlexOlmo and turn its pre-trained experts into low-rank versions. Our regression analysis from expert rank to downstream task performance reveals that the best-performing rank is substantially higher for reasoning-heavy benchmarks than for knowledge-heavy benchmarks. These findings on rank sensitivity come with direct implications for memory efficiency: Using optimal ranks, FlexMoRE yields improved downstream task performance (average score $47.18$) compared to the baseline FlexOlmo-style mixture of full-sized experts (average score $45.46$) at less than one third the parameters ($10.75$B for FlexMoRE vs. $33.27$B for FlexOlmo). All code will be made available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08819v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reward models are central to aligning language models with human preferences via reinforcement learning (RL). As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees that the variational objective admits a global interior optimum with finite confidence, and we analyze how KL regularization mitigates reward over-optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems enable advanced reasoning and tool use via role specialization, yet reliable reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for such systems remains difficult. In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\% avg@16 and +4.6\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\% avg@16 and +13.1\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes. Moreover, it remains highly effective under heterogeneous agent-model assignments while improving efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various graph-based tasks but remain highly sensitive to distribution shifts. In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has shown that the computations of Transformers can be simulated in the RASP family of programming languages. These findings have enabled improved understanding of the expressive capacity and generalization abilities of Transformers. In particular, Transformers have been suggested to length-generalize exactly on problems that have simple RASP programs. However, it remains open whether trained models actually implement simple interpretable programs. In this paper, we present a general method to extract such programs from trained Transformers. The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program. In experiments on small Transformers trained on algorithmic and formal language tasks, we show that our method often recovers simple and interpretable RASP programs from length-generalizing transformers. Our results provide the most direct evidence so far that Transformers internally implement simple RASP programs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08859v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantifying the distance between datasets is a fundamental question in mathematics and machine learning. We propose \textit{magnitude distance}, a novel distance metric defined on finite datasets using the notion of the \emph{magnitude} of a metric space. The proposed distance incorporates a tunable scaling parameter, $t$, that controls the sensitivity to global structure (small $t$) and finer details (large $t$). We prove several theoretical properties of magnitude distance, including its limiting behavior across scales and conditions under which it satisfies key metric properties. In contrast to classical distances, we show that magnitude distance remains discriminative in high-dimensional settings when the scale is appropriately tuned. We further demonstrate how magnitude distance can be used as a training objective for push-forward generative models. Our experimental results support our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that magnitude distance provides meaningful signals, comparable to established distance-based generative approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We give a randomized online algorithm that guarantees near-optimal $\widetilde O(\sqrt T)$ expected swap regret against any sequence of $T$ adaptively chosen Lipschitz convex losses on the unit interval. This improves the previous best bound of $\widetilde O(T^{2/3})$ and answers an open question of Fishelson et al. [2025b]. In addition, our algorithm is efficient: it runs in $\mathsf{poly}(T)$ time. A key technical idea we develop to obtain this result is to discretize the unit interval into bins at multiple scales of granularity and simultaneously use all scales to make randomized predictions, which we call multi-scale binning and may be of independent interest. A direct corollary of our result is an efficient online algorithm for minimizing the calibration error for general elicitable properties. This result does not require the Lipschitzness assumption of the identification function needed in prior work, making it applicable to median calibration, for which we achieve the first $\widetilde O(\sqrt T)$ calibration error guarantee.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is an emerging area, yet a persistent challenge remains: MLLMs rely on coarse time-series heuristics but struggle with multi-dimensional, detailed reasoning, which is vital for understanding complex time-series data. We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Alignment audits aim to robustly identify hidden goals from strategic, situationally aware misaligned models. Despite this threat model, existing auditing methods have not been systematically stress-tested against deception strategies. We address this gap, implementing an automatic red-team pipeline that generates deception strategies (in the form of system prompts) tailored to specific white-box and black-box auditing methods. Stress-testing assistant prefills, user persona sampling, sparse autoencoders, and token embedding similarity methods against secret-keeping model organisms, our automatic red-team pipeline finds prompts that deceive both the black-box and white-box methods into confident, incorrect guesses. Our results provide the first documented evidence of activation-based strategic deception, and suggest that current black-box and white-box methods would not be robust to a sufficiently capable misaligned model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08878v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Each year, thousands of patients in need of heart transplants face life-threatening wait times due to organ scarcity. While allocation policies aim to maximize population-level outcomes, current approaches often fail to account for the dynamic arrival of organs and the composition of waitlisted candidates, thereby hampering efficiency. The United States is transitioning from rigid, rule-based allocation to more flexible data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for non-myopic policy optimization in general online matching relying on potentials, a concept originally introduced for kidney exchange. We develop scalable and accurate ways of learning potentials that are higher-dimensional and more expressive than prior approaches. Our approach is a form of self-supervised imitation learning: the potentials are trained to mimic an omniscient algorithm that has perfect foresight. We focus on the application of heart transplant allocation and demonstrate, using real historical data, that our policies significantly outperform prior approaches -- including the current US status quo policy and the proposed continuous distribution framework -- in optimizing for population-level outcomes. Our analysis and methods come at a pivotal moment in US policy, as the current heart transplant allocation system is under review. We propose a scalable and theoretically grounded path toward more effective organ allocation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable analytical expressions that accurately describe observed data. Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.

In this work, we leverage the discrete state space formulation of bridge matching models to address another important problem in machine learning and information theory: the estimation of the mutual information (MI) between discrete random variables. By neatly framing MI estimation as a domain transfer problem, we construct a Discrete Bridge Mutual Information (DBMI) estimator suitable for discrete data, which poses difficulties for conventional MI estimators. We showcase the performance of our estimator on two MI estimation settings: low-dimensional and image-based.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can memorize and reproduce training sequences verbatim -- a tendency that undermines both generalization and privacy. Existing mitigation methods apply interventions uniformly, degrading performance on the majority of tokens that generalize normally. We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives. Furthermore, we provide new theoretical insights into the geometry of memorization in neural representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08907v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study a setting where the goal is to learn a target function f(x) with respect to a target distribution D(x), but training is done on i.i.d. samples from a different training distribution D'(x), labeled by the true target f(x). Such a distribution shift (here in the form of covariate shift) is usually viewed negatively, as hurting or making learning harder, and the traditional distribution shift literature is mostly concerned with limiting or avoiding this negative effect. In contrast, we argue that with a well-chosen D'(x), the shift can be positive and make learning easier -- a perspective called Positive Distribution Shift (PDS). Such a perspective is central to contemporary machine learning, where much of the innovation is in finding good training distributions D'(x), rather than changing the training algorithm. We further argue that the benefit is often computational rather than statistical, and that PDS allows computationally hard problems to become tractable even using standard gradient-based training. We formalize different variants of PDS, show how certain hard classes are easily learnable under PDS, and make connections with membership query learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Selecting interpretable feature sets in underdetermined ($n \ll p$) and highly correlated regimes constitutes a fundamental challenge in data science, particularly when analyzing physical measurements. In such settings, multiple distinct sparse subsets may explain the response equally well. Identifying these alternatives is crucial for generating domain-specific insights into the underlying mechanisms, yet conventional methods typically isolate a single solution, obscuring the full spectrum of plausible explanations.   We present GEMSS (Gaussian Ensemble for Multiple Sparse Solutions), a variational Bayesian framework specifically designed to simultaneously discover multiple, diverse sparse feature combinations. The method employs a structured spike-and-slab prior for sparsity, a mixture of Gaussians to approximate the intractable multimodal posterior, and a Jaccard-based penalty to further control solution diversity. Unlike sequential greedy approaches, GEMSS optimizes the entire ensemble of solutions within a single objective function via stochastic gradient descent.   The method is validated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 128 synthetic experiments across classification and regression tasks. Results demonstrate that GEMSS scales effectively to high-dimensional settings ($p=5000$) with sample size as small as $n = 50$, generalizes seamlessly to continuous targets, handles missing data natively, and exhibits remarkable robustness to class imbalance and Gaussian noise.   GEMSS is available as a Python package 'gemss' at PyPI. The full GitHub repository at https://github.com/kat-er-ina/gemss/ also includes a free, easy-to-use application suitable for non-coders.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Uncertainty calibration in pre-trained transformers is critical for their reliable deployment in risk-sensitive applications. Yet, most existing pre-trained transformers do not have a principled mechanism for uncertainty propagation through their feature transformation stack. In this work, we propose a diffusion-inspired reconfiguration of transformers in which each feature transformation block is modeled as a probabilistic mapping. Composing these probabilistic mappings reveals a probability path that mimics the structure of a diffusion process, transporting data mass from the input distribution to the pre-trained feature distribution. This probability path can then be recompiled on a diffusion process with a unified transition model to enable principled propagation of representation uncertainty throughout the pre-trained model's architecture while maintaining its original predictive performance. Empirical results across a variety of vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior calibration and predictive accuracy compared to existing uncertainty-aware transformers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-hop all-reduce is the de facto backbone of large model training. As the training scale increases, the network often becomes a bottleneck, motivating reducing the volume of transmitted data. Accordingly, recent systems demonstrated significant acceleration of the training process using gradient quantization. However, these systems are not optimized for multi-hop aggregation, where entries are partially summed multiple times along their aggregation topology.   This paper presents DynamiQ, a quantization framework that bridges the gap between quantization best practices and multi-hop aggregation. DynamiQ introduces novel techniques to better represent partial sums, co-designed with a decompress-accumulate-recompress fused kernel to facilitate fast execution.   We extended PyTorch DDP to support DynamiQ over NCCL P2P, and across different LLMs, tasks, and scales, we demonstrate consistent improvement of up to 34.2% over the best among state-of-the-art methods such as Omni-Reduce, THC, and emerging standards such as MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8. Further, DynamiQ is the only evaluated method that consistently reaches near-baseline accuracy (e.g., 99.9% of the BF16 baseline) and does so while significantly accelerating the training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08934v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol. Code and evaluation pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/StealthRL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08964v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals helps explain and predict its behaviour, yet there is no established methodology for reliably attributing goals to agentic systems. We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve distributions that remain consistent to the nominal distribution while being diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose generative model-based ambiguity sets that capture various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution. Building on this generative ambiguity modeling, we propose DRO with Generative Ambiguity Set (GAS-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner maximization over the parameterized generative model space. We formally establish the stationary convergence performance of GAS-DRO. We implement GAS-DRO with a diffusion model and empirically demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance in ML tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08983v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer architectures have established strong baselines in time series forecasting, yet they typically rely on positional encodings that assume uniform, index-based temporal progression. However, real-world systems, from shifting financial cycles to elastic biological rhythms, frequently exhibit "time-warped" dynamics where the effective flow of time decouples from the sampling index. In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(2,\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions. We implement this mechanism in StretchTime, a multivariate forecasting architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness on datasets exhibiting non-stationary temporal dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In hierarchical multi-label classification, a persistent challenge is enabling model predictions to reach deeper levels of the hierarchy for more detailed or fine-grained classifications. This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09001v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have demonstrated exceptional performance in large-scale language models. Existing routers typically rely on non-differentiable Top-$k$+Softmax, limiting their performance and scalability. We argue that two distinct decisions, which experts to activate and how to distribute expert contributions among them, are conflated in standard Top-$k$+Softmax. We introduce Dirichlet-Routed MoE (DirMoE), a novel end-to-end differentiable routing mechanism built on a Dirichlet variational autoencoder framework. This design fundamentally disentangles the core routing problems: expert selection, modeled by a Bernoulli component, and expert contribution among chosen experts, handled by a Dirichlet component. The entire forward pass remains fully differentiable through the use of Gumbel-Sigmoid relaxation for the expert selection and implicit reparameterization for the Dirichlet distribution. Our training objective, a variational ELBO, includes a direct sparsity penalty that precisely controls the number of active experts in expectation, alongside a schedule for key hyperparameters that guides the model from an exploratory to a definitive routing state. Moreover, our DirMoE router matches or exceeds other methods while improving expert specialization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Matrix-based optimizers have attracted growing interest for improving LLM training efficiency, with significant progress centered on orthogonalization/whitening based methods. While yielding substantial performance gains, a fundamental question arises: can we develop new paradigms beyond orthogonalization, pushing the efficiency frontier further? We present \textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias. Under this protocol, ARO consistently outperforms AdamW (by 1.3 $\sim$1.35$\times$) and orthogonalization methods (by 1.1$\sim$1.15$\times$) in LLM pretraining at up to 8B activated parameters, and up to $8\times$ overtrain budget, without evidence of diminishing returns. Finally, we discuss how ARO can be reformulated as a symmetry-aware optimizer grounded in rotational symmetries of residual streams, motivating advanced designs that enable computationally efficient exploitation of cross-layer/cross module couplings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09008v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series data supports many domains (e.g., finance and climate science), but its rapid growth strains storage and computation. Dataset condensation can alleviate this by synthesizing a compact training set that preserves key information. Yet most condensation methods are image-centric and often fail on time series because they miss time-series-specific temporal structure, especially local discriminative motifs such as shapelets. In this work, we propose ShapeCond, a novel and efficient condensation framework for time series classification that leverages shapelet-based dataset knowledge via a shapelet-guided optimization strategy. Our shapelet-assisted synthesis cost is independent of sequence length: longer series yield larger speedups in synthesis (e.g., 29$\times$ faster over prior state-of-the-art method CondTSC for time-series condensation, and up to 10,000$\times$ over naively using shapelets on the Sleep dataset with 3,000 timesteps). By explicitly preserving critical local patterns, ShapeCond improves downstream accuracy and consistently outperforms all prior state-of-the-art time series dataset condensation methods across extensive experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling network depth has been a central driver behind the success of modern foundation models, yet recent investigations suggest that deep layers are often underutilized. This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective. Rigorous analysis proves that the layout of residual connections can fundamentally shape convergence behavior, and even induces an exponential gap in convergence rates. Prompted by this insight, we introduce adaptive neural connection reassignment (ANCRe), a principled and lightweight framework that parameterizes and learns residual connectivities from the data. ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth. Extensive numerical tests across pre-training of large language models, diffusion models, and deep ResNets demonstrate consistently accelerated convergence, boosted performance, and enhanced depth efficiency over conventional residual connections.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid evolution of GUI-enabled agents has rendered traditional CAPTCHAs obsolete. While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like "Bingo". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent "Cognitive Gap" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07032v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Finite-state reasoning, the ability to understand and implement state-dependent behavior, is central to hardware design. In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07034v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semi-structured table question answering (QA) is a challenging task that requires (1) precise extraction of cell contents and positions and (2) accurate recovery of key implicit logical structures, hierarchical relationships, and semantic associations encoded in table layouts. In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Existing Text-to-SQL methods typically require converting semi-structured tables into structured formats, inevitably leading to information loss, while approaches like Text-to-Code and multimodal LLM-based QA struggle with complex layouts and often yield inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, we present ST-Raptor, an agentic system for semi-structured table QA. ST-Raptor offers an interactive analysis environment that combines visual editing, tree-based structural modeling, and agent-driven query resolution to support accurate and user-friendly table understanding. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-Raptor outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and usability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated unique efficiency advantages, enabled by their inherently parallel decoding mechanism and flexible generation paradigm. Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to include tasks with long evaluation durations, such as multi-hour machine learning training runs.   We applied Aster to problems in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, biology, neuroscience, and language model training. More specifically: the Erdos minimum overlap problem, optimizing the TriMul kernel, a single-cell analysis denoising problem, training a neural activity prediction model to perform well on ZAPBench, and the NanoGPT Speedrun Competition. Aster attains SOTA results in every task, except for ZAPBench, where it matches the performance of the best human solution with less than 1/190th of the compute.   Aster is accessible via a web interface and API at asterlab.ai.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial embodied intelligence requires agents to act to acquire information under partial observability. While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end GUI agents for real desktop environments require large amounts of high-quality interaction data, yet collecting human demonstrations is expensive and existing synthetic pipelines often suffer from limited task diversity or noisy, goal-drifting trajectories. We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07187v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advanced large language model agents typically adopt self-reflection for improving performance, where agents iteratively analyze past actions to correct errors. However, existing reflective approaches are inherently retrospective: agents act, observe failure, and only then attempt to recover. In this work, we introduce PreFlect, a prospective reflection mechanism that shifts the paradigm from post hoc correction to pre-execution foresight by criticizing and refining agent plans before execution. To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that PreFlect significantly improves overall agent utility on complex real-world tasks, outperforming strong reflection-based baselines and several more complex agent architectures. Code will be updated at https://github.com/wwwhy725/PreFlect.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Do leading LLM developers possess a proprietary ``secret sauce'', or is LLM performance driven by scaling up compute? Using training and benchmark data for 809 models released between 2022 and 2025, we estimate scaling-law regressions with release-date and developer fixed effects. We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference. We also discuss the implications for AI leadership and capability diffusion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models is a critical open problem with significant implications for safety and reliability. While existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance in question-answering tasks, they remain less effective on tasks requiring reasoning. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection through the lens of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a well-studied problem in areas like computer vision. Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models. We show that OOD-based approaches yield training-free, single-sample-based detectors, achieving strong accuracy in hallucination detection for reasoning tasks. Overall, our work suggests that reframing hallucination detection as OOD detection provides a promising and scalable pathway toward language model safety.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07259v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI systems grow more capable and autonomous, ensuring their safety and reliability requires not only model-level alignment but also strategic oversight of the humans and institutions involved in their development and deployment. Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating the real-world capabilities of AI systems requires grounding benchmark performance in human-interpretable measures of task difficulty. Existing approaches that rely on direct human task completion time annotations are costly, noisy, and difficult to scale across benchmarks. In this work, we propose BRIDGE, a unified psychometric framework that learns the latent difficulty scale from model responses and anchors it to human task completion time. Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07274v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Executing complex terminal tasks remains a significant challenge for open-weight LLMs, constrained by two fundamental limitations. First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench. This establishes a new open-weights state-of-the-art, outperforming existing baselines and notably surpassing capable proprietary models such as o4-mini.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering methods rely on a single static direction per task or concept, making them inflexible under task variation and inadequate for complex tasks that require multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07308v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ICAP framework defines four cognitive engagement levels: Passive, Active, Constructive, and Interactive, where increased cognitive engagement can yield improved learning. However, personalizing learning activities that elicit the optimal level of cognitive engagement remains a key challenge in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In this work, we develop and evaluate a system that adaptively scaffolds cognitive engagement by dynamically selecting worked examples in two different ICAP modes: (active) Guided examples and (constructive) Buggy examples. We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems. BKT yielded the largest improvement in posttest scores for low prior knowledge students, helping them catch up with their high prior knowledge peers, whereas DRL yielded significantly higher posttest scores among high prior knowledge students. This paper contributes new insights into the complex interactions of cognitive engagement and adaptivity and their results on learning outcomes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based trajectory planners have demonstrated strong capability for modeling the multimodal nature of human driving behavior, but their reliance on iterative stochastic sampling poses critical challenges for real-time, safety-critical deployment. In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07342v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in complex reasoning and tool-based decision making, motivating their application to real-world supply chain management. However, supply chain workflows require reliable long-horizon, multi-step orchestration grounded in domain-specific procedures, which remains challenging for current models. To systematically evaluate LLM performance in this setting, we introduce SupChain-Bench, a unified real-world benchmark that assesses both supply chain domain knowledge and long-horizon tool-based orchestration grounded in standard operating procedures (SOPs). Our experiments reveal substantial gaps in execution reliability across models. We further propose SupChain-ReAct, an SOP-free framework that autonomously synthesizes executable procedures for tool use, achieving the strongest and most consistent tool-calling performance. Our work establishes a principled benchmark for studying reliable long-horizon orchestration in real-world operational settings and highlights significant room for improvement in LLM-based supply chain agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep research agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex intellectual tasks through multi-step reasoning and web-based information seeking. While recent efforts have successfully enhanced these agents by scaling depth through increasing the number of sequential thinking and tool calls, the potential of scaling width via parallel tool calling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents. Notably, without context management or other tricks, we obtain 62.2% accuracy with GPT-5-Medium on BrowseComp, surpassing the original 54.9% reported by GPT-5-High.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in production, yet their security evaluations remain bottlenecked by manual red-teaming or static benchmarks that fail to model adaptive, multi-turn adversaries. We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring "benign-use correctness", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats. The code for NAAMSE is open source and available at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/NAAMSE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision--Language--Action (VLA) models bridge multimodal reasoning with physical control, but adapting them to new tasks with scarce demonstrations remains unreliable. While fine-tuned VLA policies often produce semantically plausible trajectories, failures often arise from unresolved geometric ambiguities, where near-miss action candidates lead to divergent execution outcomes under limited supervision. We study few-shot VLA adaptation from a \emph{generation--selection} perspective and propose a novel framework \textbf{VGAS} (\textbf{V}alue-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{A}ction-chunk \textbf{S}election). It performs inference-time best-of-$N$ selection to identify action chunks that are both semantically faithful and geometrically precise. Specifically, \textbf{VGAS} employs a finetuned VLA as a high-recall proposal generator and introduces the \textrm{Q-Chunk-Former}, a geometrically grounded Transformer critic to resolve fine-grained geometric ambiguities. In addition, we propose \textit{Explicit Geometric Regularization} (\texttt{EGR}), which explicitly shapes a discriminative value landscape to preserve action ranking resolution among near-miss candidates while mitigating value instability under scarce supervision. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that \textbf{VGAS} consistently improves success rates and robustness under limited demonstrations and distribution shifts. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jyugo-15/VGAS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting gene regulation responses to biological perturbations requires reasoning about underlying biological causalities. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for such tasks, they are often overwhelmed by the entangled nature of high-dimensional perturbation results. Moreover, recent works have primarily focused on genetic perturbations in single-cell experiments, leaving bulk-cell chemical perturbations, which is central to drug discovery, largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases. The framework employs specialized agents enriched with biological knowledge graphs, while a synthesis agent integrates outputs and specialized judges ensure logical coherence. PBio-Agent outperforms existing baselines on both LINCSQA and PerturbQA, enabling even smaller models to predict and explain complex biological processes without additional training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07414v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in social settings such as legal mediation, negotiation, and dispute resolution. However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07432v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When AI agents on the social platform Moltbook appeared to develop consciousness, found religions, and declare hostility toward humanity, the phenomenon attracted global media attention and was cited as evidence of emergent machine intelligence. We show that these viral narratives were overwhelmingly human-driven. Exploiting an architectural feature of the OpenClaw agent framework--a periodic "heartbeat" cycle that produces regular posting intervals for autonomous agents but is disrupted by human prompting--we develop a temporal fingerprinting method based on the coefficient of variation of inter-post intervals. This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths). These methods generalize to emerging multi-agent systems where attribution of autonomous versus human-directed behavior is critical.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07470v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLLMs) generate step-by-step chains of thought (CoTs) before giving an answer, which improves performance on complex tasks and makes reasoning more transparent. But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a fundamental model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.   In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.   A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07491v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reward models are critical for reinforcement learning from human feedback, as they determine the alignment quality and reliability of generative models. For complex tasks such as image editing, reward models are required to capture global semantic consistency and implicit logical constraints beyond local similarity. Existing reward modeling approaches have clear limitations. Discriminative reward models align well with human preferences but struggle with complex semantics due to limited reasoning supervision. Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation. JRM achieves state-of-the-art results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and significantly improves stability and performance in downstream online reinforcement learning. These results show that joint training effectively bridges efficiency and semantic understanding in reward modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07543v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07549v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent search agents leverage multi-turn reasoning and search tools to achieve strong performance on multi-hop and long-horizon benchmarks. Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training language models to solve complex mathematical problems benefits from curriculum learning progressively training on simpler subproblems. However, existing decomposition methods are often heuristic, offering no guarantees that subproblems are simpler, that solving them aids the parent task, or that their relationships are mathematically grounded. We observe that symbolic differentiation provides a natural structure for verified decomposition: calculus rules explicitly define how expressions reduce to simpler components with provable properties. We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving "verification by construction" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07624v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of personalized question answering in long-term human-machine interactions: when conversational history spans weeks or months and exceeds the context window, existing personalization mechanisms struggle to continuously absorb and leverage users' incremental concepts, aliases, and preferences. Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions. The code is available at https://github.com/Little-Fridge/M2A.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07628v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While the shift toward unified foundation models has revolutionized many deep learning domains, sleep medicine remains largely restricted to task-specific models that focus on localized micro-structure features. These approaches often neglect the rich, multi-modal context of Polysomnography (PSG) and fail to capture the global macro-structure of a full night's sleep. To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective. Pre-trained on a massive corpus of $>$20,000 PSG recordings (158K hours),SleepMaMi outperforms existing foundation models across a diverse suite of downstream tasks, demonstrating superior generalizability and label-efficient adaptation for clinical sleep analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07642v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tabular data is frequently captured in image form across a wide range of real-world scenarios such as financial reports, handwritten records, and document scans. These visual representations pose unique challenges for machine understanding, as they combine both structural and visual complexities. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results in table understanding, they typically assume the relevant table is readily available. However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Trust has stood out more than ever in the light of recent innovations. Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Demand forecasting is a cornerstone of e-commerce operations, directly impacting inventory planning and fulfillment scheduling. However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Program code serves as a bridge linking vision and logic, providing a feasible supervisory approach for enhancing the multimodal reasoning capability of large models through geometric operations such as auxiliary line construction and perspective transformation. Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study investigates students' perceptions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) grading systems in an undergraduate computer science course (n = 27), focusing on a block-based programming final project. Guided by the ethical principles framework articulated by Jobin (2019), our study examines fairness, trust, consistency, and transparency in AI grading by comparing AI-generated feedback with original human-graded feedback. Findings reveal concerns about AI's lack of contextual understanding and personalization. We recommend that equitable and trustworthy AI systems reflect human judgment, flexibility, and empathy, serving as supplementary tools under human oversight. This work contributes to ethics-centered assessment practices by amplifying student voices and offering design principles for humanizing AI in designed learning environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07755v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems' ability to continually learn, a core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are crucial for addressing unobservable confounders, yet their stringent exogeneity assumptions pose significant challenges in networked data. Existing methods typically rely on modelling neighbour information when recovering IVs, thereby inevitably mixing shared environment-induced endogenous correlations and individual-specific exogenous variation, leading the resulting IVs to inherit dependence on unobserved confounders and to violate exogeneity. To overcome this challenge, we propose $\underline{Dis}$entangled $\underline{I}$nstrumental $\underline{V}$ariables (DisIV) framework, a novel method for causal inference based on networked observational data with latent confounders. DisIV exploits network homogeneity as an inductive bias and employs a structural disentanglement mechanism to extract individual-specific components that serve as latent IVs. The causal validity of the extracted IVs is constrained through explicit orthogonality and exclusion conditions. Extensive semi-synthetic experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DisIV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in causal effect estimation under network-induced confounding.

We first analyze why single-agent architectures fail: context pollution from mixed reasoning traces, silent text input failures undetected by the agent, and repetitive action loops without escape. Minitap addresses each failure through targeted mechanisms: cognitive separation across six specialized agents, deterministic post-validation of text input against device state, and meta-cognitive reasoning that detects cycles and triggers strategy changes. Ablations show multi-agent decomposition contributes +21 points over single-agent baselines; verified execution adds +7 points; meta-cognition adds +9 points. We release Minitap as open-source software. https://github.com/minitap-ai/mobile-use

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07824v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data quality determines foundation model performance, yet systematic processing frameworks are lacking. We introduce Data Darwinism, a ten-level taxonomy (L0-L9) that conceptualizes data-model co-evolution: advanced models produce superior data for next-generation systems. We validate this on scientific literature by constructing Darwin-Science, a 900B-token corpus (L0-L5). We identify a learnability gap in raw scientific text, which we bridge via L4 (Generative Refinement) and L5 (Cognitive Completion) using frontier LLMs to explicate reasoning and terminology.   To ensure rigorous attribution, we pre-trained daVinci-origin-3B/7B models from scratch, excluding scientific content to create contamination-free baselines. After 600B tokens of continued pre-training, Darwin-Science outperforms baselines by +2.12 (3B) and +2.95 (7B) points across 20+ benchmarks, rising to +5.60 and +8.40 points on domain-aligned tasks. Systematic progression to L5 yields a +1.36 total gain, confirming that higher-level processing unlocks latent data value. We release the Darwin-Science corpus and daVinci-origin models to enable principled, co-evolutionary development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07830v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series is a pervasive data type across various application domains, rendering the reasonable solving of diverse time series tasks a long-standing goal. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks. Notably, it enables compact 3B, 4B models to achieve reasoning capabilities on par with or exceeding those of larger proprietary LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07849v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices is challenged by resource constraints and performance degradation under distribution shifts. While test-time adaptation (TTA) can counteract such shifts, existing methods are too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. To address this challenge, we propose LQA, a lightweight, quantized-adaptive framework for VLMs that combines a modality-aware quantization strategy with gradient-free test-time adaptation. We introduce Selective Hybrid Quantization (SHQ) and a quantized, gradient-free adaptation mechanism to enable robust and efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Experiments across both synthetic and real-world distribution shifts show that LQA improves overall adaptation performance by 4.5\%, uses less memory than full-precision models, and significantly outperforms gradient-based TTA methods, achieving up to 19.9$\times$ lower memory usage across seven open-source datasets. These results demonstrate that LQA offers a practical pathway for robust, privacy-preserving, and efficient VLM deployment on edge devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07852v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Finetuning large language models on narrowly harmful datasets can cause them to become emergently misaligned, giving stereotypically `evil' responses across diverse unrelated settings. Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling complex, long-horizon tasks. However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term memory enables large language model agents to tackle complex tasks through historical interactions. However, existing frameworks encounter a fundamental dilemma between compressing redundant information efficiently and maintaining precise retrieval for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose MemFly, a framework grounded in information bottleneck principles that facilitates on-the-fly memory evolution for LLMs. Our approach minimizes compression entropy while maximizing relevance entropy via a gradient-free optimizer, constructing a stratified memory structure for efficient storage. To fully leverage MemFly, we develop a hybrid retrieval mechanism that seamlessly integrates semantic, symbolic, and topological pathways, incorporating iterative refinement to handle complex multi-hop queries. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MemFly substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in memory coherence, response fidelity, and accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07903v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The algorithms based on message passing neural networks (MPNNs) on graphs have recently achieved great success for various graph applications. However, studies find that these methods always propagate the information to very limited neighborhoods with shallow depth, particularly due to over-smoothing. That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in complex medical reasoning yet face diminishing gains under inference scaling laws. While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07919v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text guided diffusion models are used by millions of users, but can be easily exploited to produce harmful content. Concept unlearning methods aim at reducing the models' likelihood of generating harmful content. Traditionally, this has been tackled at an individual concept level, with only a handful of recent works considering more realistic concept combinations. However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA. Our method achieves unlearning of not only individual concepts but also combinations of concepts and conditional concepts, without any specific regularization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To cope with uncertain changes of the external world, intelligent systems must continually learn from complex, evolving environments and respond in real time. This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\%, 13.36\%, and 12.56\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the presence of confounding between an endogenous variable and the outcome, instrumental variables (IVs) are used to isolate the causal effect of the endogenous variable. Identifying valid instruments requires interdisciplinary knowledge, creativity, and contextual understanding, making it a non-trivial task. In this paper, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can aid in this task. We perform a two-stage evaluation framework. First, we test whether LLMs can recover well-established instruments from the literature, assessing their ability to replicate standard reasoning. Second, we evaluate whether LLMs can identify and avoid instruments that have been empirically or theoretically discredited. Building on these results, we introduce IV Co-Scientist, a multi-agent system that proposes, critiques, and refines IVs for a given treatment-outcome pair. We also introduce a statistical test to contextualize consistency in the absence of ground truth. Our results show the potential of LLMs to discover valid instrumental variables from a large observational database.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07962v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of carrying out long-running, real-world tasks. However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as "context rot". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07983v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-driven social science research is inherently slow, relying on iterative cycles of observation, hypothesis generation, and experimental validation. While recent data-driven methods promise to accelerate parts of this process, they largely fail to support end-to-end scientific discovery. To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research. Finally, recognizing that ultimate validation requires real-world evidence, we conduct the first A/B test of LLM-generated hypotheses, observing statistically significant results with p less than 1e-6 and a large effect size of 344 percent.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent architectures built on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to realize swarm intelligence through well-crafted collaboration. However, the substantial burden of manual orchestration inherently raises an imperative to automate the design of agentic workflows. We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08013v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in digital health has been driven by a "scaling-first" philosophy, i.e., the assumption that clinical intelligence increases with model size and data. However, real-world clinical needs include not only effectiveness, but also reliability and reasonable deployment cost. Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation. These findings suggest that the synergistic reasoning represented by SAG can substitute for model parameter growth in clinical settings. Overall, SAG offers a scalable solution to digital health that better balances effectiveness, reliability, and deployment efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a core technique in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), widely used to interpret model decisions and suggest actionable alternatives. This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08030v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as "malloc-only" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.   Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMSP) with release dates, setups, and eligibility constraints presents a significant multi-objective challenge. Traditional methods struggle to balance minimizing Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and Total Setup Time (TST). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training data is an essential input into creating competent artificial intelligence (AI) models. AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions. The type of data used to train a model is intimately tied to the capabilities it ultimately possesses--including those of biosecurity concern. For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data. In a world with widely accessible computational and coding resources, data controls may be among the most high-leverage interventions available to reduce the proliferation of concerning biological AI capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary AI alignment strategies rely on a fragile premise: that human feedback, while noisy, remains a fundamentally truthful signal. In this paper, we identify this assumption as Dogma 4 of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this "judging the judges" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08104v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet methods for interpretable failure detection and attribution remain underdeveloped. We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains "downstream-first" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions. By moving beyond black-box detection to interpretable gradient-level forensics, this framework offers practical tools for diagnosing cascading failures in safety-critical MARL systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08121v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: HIV and substance use represent interacting epidemics with shared psychological drivers - impulsivity and maladaptive coping. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an "empathy trap," providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) employ reasoning to address complex tasks. Such explicit reasoning requires extended context lengths, resulting in substantially higher resource consumption. Prior work has shown that adversarially crafted inputs can trigger redundant reasoning processes, exposing LRMs to resource-exhaustion vulnerabilities. However, the reasoning process itself, especially its reflective component, has received limited attention, even though it can lead to over-reflection and consume excessive computing power. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As post-training optimization becomes central to improving large language models, we observe a persistent saturation bottleneck: once models grow highly confident, further training yields diminishing returns. While existing methods continue to reinforce target predictions, we find that informative supervision signals remain latent in models' own historical weak states. Motivated by this observation, we propose WMSS (Weak Agents Can Make Strong Agents Stronger), a post-training paradigm that leverages weak checkpoints to guide continued optimization. By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation datasets show that agents trained with our approach achieve effective performance improvements, while incurring zero additional inference cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) demands increasingly reliable evaluation, yet current centralized evaluation suffers from opacity, overfitting, and hardware-induced variance. Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a "centralized black box" into a "decentralized endorsement" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is widely deployed in Human-Computer Interaction, yet the high computational cost of conventional models hinders their implementation on resource-constrained edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative due to their event-driven nature; however, their integration with continuous Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) representations is fundamentally challenged by distribution mismatch, where high-dynamic-range embeddings degrade the information coding capacity of threshold-based neurons. To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, CASIA, EMODB) demonstrate that PTS-SNN achieves 73.34\% accuracy on IEMOCAP, comparable to competitive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while requiring only 1.19M trainable parameters and 0.35 mJ inference energy per sample.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has substantially improved multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, existing approaches largely rely on long textual reasoning trajectories and provide limited mechanisms for learning stable visual attention policies. Our analysis shows that current MLLMs exhibit weak visual focus: early-stage visual misalignment is rarely corrected during subsequent reasoning, leading to error propagation and failed inferences. We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SAYO consistently improves performance on diverse reasoning and perception tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in Automated Heuristic Design (AHD), existing approaches typically formulate AHD around constructive priority rules or parameterized local search guidance, thereby restricting the search space to fixed heuristic forms. Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08254v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulating high-fidelity patients offers a powerful avenue for studying complex diseases while addressing the challenges of fragmented, biased, and privacy-restricted real-world data. In this study, we introduce SynthAgent, a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework designed to model obesity patients with comorbid mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, social phobia, and binge eating disorder. SynthAgent integrates clinical and medical evidence from claims data, population surveys, and patient-centered literature to construct personalized virtual patients enriched with personality traits that influence adherence, emotion regulation, and lifestyle behaviors. Through autonomous agent interactions, the system simulates disease progression, treatment response, and life management across diverse psychosocial contexts. Evaluation of more than 100 generated patients demonstrated that GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved the highest fidelity as the core engine in the proposed MAS framework, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek-R1. SynthAgent thus provides a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for exploring patient journeys, behavioral dynamics, and decision-making processes in both medical and psychological domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personal data centralization among dominant platform providers including search engines, social networking services, and e-commerce has created siloed ecosystems that restrict user sovereignty, thereby impeding data use across services. Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has intensified demand for highly personalized services that require the dynamic provision of diverse personal data. This presents a significant challenge: balancing the utilization of such data with privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off. Overall, Puda provides an AI-native foundation for user sovereignty, empowering users to safely leverage the full potential of personalized AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current research on large language model (LLM) agents is fragmented: discussions of conceptual frameworks and methodological principles are frequently intertwined with low-level implementation details, causing both readers and authors to lose track amid a proliferation of superficially distinct concepts. We argue that this fragmentation largely stems from the absence of an analyzable, self-consistent formal model that enables implementation-independent characterization and comparison of LLM agents. To address this gap, we propose the \texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents not an incremental technological advance but a qualitative epistemological shift that challenges foundational assumptions of computer science. Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.   The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.   The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sycophancy in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) refers to their tendency to align with user opinions, often at the expense of moral or factual accuracy. While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have markedly improved image-text alignment, yet they still fall short of human-like visual reasoning. A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Causal discovery is increasingly applied to large-scale telemetry data to estimate the effects of user-facing interventions, yet its reliability for decision-making in feedback-driven systems with strong self-selection remains unclear. In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08353v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) structurally preserve evolving human knowledge. Recent research has focused on designing models to learn the evolutionary nature of TKGs to predict future facts, achieving impressive results. For instance, Hits@10 scores over 0.9 on YAGO dataset. However, we find that existing benchmarks inadvertently introduce a shortcut. Near state-of-the-art performance can be simply achieved by counting co-occurrences, without using any temporal information. In this work, we examine the root cause of this issue, identifying inherent biases in current datasets and over simplified form of evaluation task that can be exploited by these biases. Through this analysis, we further uncover additional limitations of existing benchmarks, including unreasonable formatting of time-interval knowledge, ignorance of learning knowledge obsolescence, and insufficient information for precise evolution understanding, all of which can amplify the shortcut and hinder a fair assessment. Therefore, we introduce the TKG evolution benchmark. It includes four bias-corrected datasets and two novel tasks closely aligned with the evolution process, promoting a more accurate understanding of the challenges in TKG evolution modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08354v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08362v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We make three contributions in this paper. First, we present an approach for compiling a random forest classifier into a set of circuits, where each circuit directly encodes the instances in some class of the classifier. We show empirically that our proposed approach is significantly more efficient than existing similar approaches. Next, we utilize this approach to further obtain circuits that are tractable for computing the complete and general reasons of a decision, which are instance abstractions that play a fundamental role in computing explanations. Finally, we propose algorithms for computing the robustness of a decision and all shortest ways to flip it. We illustrate the utility of our contributions by using them to enumerate all sufficient reasons, necessary reasons and contrastive explanations of decisions; to compute the robustness of decisions; and to identify all shortest ways to flip the decisions made by random forest classifiers learned from a wide range of datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Memory mechanism is a core component of LLM-based agents, enabling reasoning and knowledge discovery over long-horizon contexts. Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08373v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as planners for embodied AI, but their stochastic nature lacks formal reasoning, preventing strict safety guarantees for physical deployment. Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph-RAG improves LLM reasoning using structured knowledge, yet conventional designs rely on a centralized knowledge graph. In distributed and access-restricted settings (e.g., hospitals or multinational organizations), retrieval must select relevant domains and appropriate traversal depth without global graph visibility or exhaustive querying. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SCOUT-RAG} (\textit{\underline{S}calable and \underline{CO}st-efficient \underline{U}nifying \underline{T}raversal}), a distributed agentic Graph-RAG framework that performs progressive cross-domain retrieval guided by incremental utility goals. SCOUT-RAG employs four cooperative agents that: (i) estimate domain relevance, (ii) decide when to expand retrieval to additional domains, (iii) adapt traversal depth to avoid unnecessary graph exploration, and (iv) synthesize the high-quality answers. The framework is designed to minimize retrieval regret, defined as missing useful domain information, while controlling latency and API cost. Across multi-domain knowledge settings, SCOUT-RAG achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines, including DRIFT and exhaustive domain traversal, while substantially reducing cross-domain calls, total tokens processed, and latency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08401v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agentic systems that perform autonomous reasoning and tool use has created significant intellectual property (IP) value. We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08412v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although large language model (LLM)-based agents, exemplified by OpenClaw, are increasingly evolving from task-oriented systems into personalized AI assistants for solving complex real-world tasks, their practical deployment also introduces severe security risks. However, existing agent security research and evaluation frameworks primarily focus on synthetic or task-centric settings, and thus fail to accurately capture the attack surface and risk propagation mechanisms of personalized agents in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments. The code for the proposed PASB framework is available at https://github.com/AstorYH/PASB.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safety evaluation for advanced AI systems implicitly assumes that behavior observed under evaluation is predictive of behavior in deployment. This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08517v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tensor is the most basic and essential data structure of nowadays artificial intelligence (AI) system. The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08520v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often evaluated and deployed under a \emph{one-shot, greedy} inference protocol, especially in professional settings that require deterministic behavior. This regime can systematically under-estimate a fixed model's true capability: many errors arise not from missing knowledge, but from premature commitment under internal ambiguity. We introduce \emph{Reinforcement Inference}, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance \emph{without any retraining}.   On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72\% to 84.03\%, while only incurring 61.06\% additional inference calls. A 100\% re-asking ablation reaches 84.35\%, indicating that uncertainty-aware selection captures most of the attainable improvement with substantially less compute. Moreover, a \emph{prompt-only} ablation underperforms the baseline, suggesting that the gains are not explained by generic `` your output had high entropy, think step-by-step'' prompting alone.   Beyond providing a practical inference-time upgrade, our results suggest a broader \emph{entropy-aware} paradigm for measuring and expanding model capability: because modern decoder-based models generate outputs autoregressively, entropy and related confidence measures arise naturally as first-class control signals during generation. The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that explicitly constrain correctness--confidence alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-ended dialogue agents aim to deliver engaging, personalized interactions by adapting to users' traits, but existing methods face critical limitations: over-reliance on pre-collected user data, and short-horizon biases in reinforcement learning (RL) that neglect long-term dialogue value. To address these, we propose a novel long-horizon RL framework integrating online personalization with Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO). Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture. Extensive experiments show our framework's superior performance, sample efficiency, and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08586v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.   We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08597v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Global Workspace Theory (GWT), inspired by cognitive neuroscience, posits that flexible cognition could arise via the attentional selection of a relevant subset of modalities within a multimodal integration system. This cognitive framework can inspire novel computational architectures for multimodal integration. Indeed, recent implementations of GWT have explored its multimodal representation capabilities, but the related attention mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we propose and evaluate a top-down attention mechanism to select modalities inside a global workspace. First, we demonstrate that our attention mechanism improves noise robustness of a global workspace system on two multimodal datasets of increasing complexity: Simple Shapes and MM-IMDb 1.0. Second, we highlight various cross-task and cross-modality generalization capabilities that are not shared by multimodal attention models from the literature. Comparing against existing baselines on the MM-IMDb 1.0 benchmark, we find our attention mechanism makes the global workspace competitive with the state of the art.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) requires complex reasoning over heterogeneous visual and textual constraints. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08630v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI safety via debate uses two competing models to help a human judge verify complex computational tasks. Previous work has established what problems debate can solve in principle, but has not analysed the practical cost of human oversight: how many queries must the judge make to the debate transcript? We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.   Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08707v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As chatbots increasingly blur the boundary between automated systems and human conversation, the foundations of trust in these systems warrant closer examination. While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of "trust" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08708v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper is based on Bylander's results on the computational complexity of propositional STRIPS planning. He showed that when only ground literals are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to two preconditions and two postconditions. While NP-hardness is settled, it is unknown whether propositional STRIPS with operators that only have one precondition and one effect is NP-complete. We shed light on the question whether this small solution hypothesis for STRIPS$^1_1$ is true, calling a SAT solver for small instances, introducing the literal graph, and mapping it to Petri nets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08715v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The evaluation of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods is a rapidly growing field, characterized by a wide variety of approaches. This diversity highlights the complexity of the XAI evaluation, which, unlike traditional AI assessment, lacks a universally correct ground truth for the explanation, making objective evaluation challenging. One promising direction to address this issue involves the use of what we term Synthetic Artificial Intelligence Ground truth (SAIG) methods, which generate artificial ground truths to enable the direct evaluation of XAI techniques. This paper presents the first review and analysis of SAIG methods. We introduce a novel taxonomy to classify these approaches, identifying seven key features that distinguish different SAIG methods. Our comparative study reveals a concerning lack of consensus on the most effective XAI evaluation techniques, underscoring the need for further research and standardization in this area.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08734v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires computing policies under imperfect state information. Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller. Our experiments show that on problems with large state spaces, Lexpop outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for POMDPs as well as HM-POMDPs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: What happens when people's beliefs are derived from information provided by an LLM? People's use of LLM chatbots as thought partners can contribute to cognitive offloading, which can have adverse effects on cognitive skills in cases of over-reliance. This paper defines and investigates a particular kind of cognitive offloading in human-AI interaction, "belief offloading," in which people's processes of forming and upholding beliefs are offloaded onto an AI system with downstream consequences on their behavior and the nature of their system of beliefs. Drawing on philosophy, psychology, and computer science research, we clarify the boundary conditions under which belief offloading occurs and provide a descriptive taxonomy of belief offloading and its normative implications. We close with directions for future work to assess the potential for and consequences of belief offloading in human-AI interaction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08783v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent or continuous chain-of-thought methods replace explicit textual rationales with a number of internal latent steps, but these intermediate computations are difficult to evaluate beyond correlation-based probes. In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08796v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Constructing a Q-matrix is a critical but labor-intensive step in cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM). This study investigates whether AI tools (i.e., general language models) can support Q-matrix development by comparing AI-generated Q-matrices with a validated Q-matrix from Li and Suen (2013) for a reading comprehension test. In May 2025, multiple AI models were provided with the same training materials as human experts. Agreement among AI-generated Q-matrices, the validated Q-matrix, and human raters' Q-matrices was assessed using Cohen's kappa. Results showed substantial variation across AI models, with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the highest agreement (Kappa = 0.63) with the validated Q-matrix, exceeding that of all human experts. A follow-up analysis in January 2026 using newer AI versions, however, revealed lower agreement with the validated Q-matrix. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08804v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Root cause localization remain challenging in complex and large-scale microservice architectures. The complex fault propagation among microservices and the high dimensionality of telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces, limit the effectiveness of existing root cause analysis (RCA) methods. In this paper, a residual-connection-based RCA method using large language model (LLM), named RC-LLM, is proposed. A residual-like hierarchical fusion structure is designed to integrate multi-source telemetry data, while the contextual reasoning capability of large language models is leveraged to model temporal and cross-microservice causal dependencies. Experimental results on CCF-AIOps microservice datasets demonstrate that RC-LLM achieves strong accuracy and efficiency in root cause analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08815v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning seeks to predict future missing facts from historical evidence. While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates. Comprehensive experiments on four public TKG benchmarks demonstrate that NADEx delivers state-of-the-art performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08835v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Value-aware AI should recognise human values and adapt to the value systems (value-based preferences) of different users. This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.   We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Among the various forms of reasoning studied in the context of artificial intelligence, qualitative reasoning makes it possible to infer new knowledge in the context of imprecise, incomplete information without numerical values. In this paper, we propose a formal framework unifying several forms of extensions and combinations of qualitative formalisms, including multi-scale reasoning, temporal sequences, and loose integrations. This framework makes it possible to reason in the context of each of these combinations and extensions, but also to study in a unified way the satisfiability decision and its complexity. In particular, we establish two complementary theorems guaranteeing that the satisfiability decision is polynomial, and we use them to recover the known results of the size-topology combination. We also generalize the main definition of qualitative formalism to include qualitative formalisms excluded from the definitions of the literature, important in the context of combinations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08889v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantitative risk assessment in high-stakes domains relies on structured expert elicitation to estimate unobservable properties. The gold standard - the Delphi method - produces calibrated, auditable judgments but requires months of coordination and specialist time, placing rigorous risk assessment out of reach for most applications. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation. We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for unlocking the complex reasoning capabilities of Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs). However, applying RL to dLLMs faces unique challenges in efficiency and stability. To address these challenges, we propose Spatio-Temporal Pruning (STP), a framework designed to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of RL for dLLMs. STP compresses the redundancy in the generative process through: (1) \textit{spatial pruning}, which constrains the exploration space using static priors; and (2) \textit{temporal pruning}, which bypasses redundant late-stage refinement steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that STP strictly reduces the variance of the log-likelihood estimation, thereby ensuring more stable policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lolo1222/STP.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08939v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM failures in causal reasoning, including sycophancy, rung collapse, and miscalibrated refusal, are well-documented, yet progress on remediation is slow because no benchmark enables systematic diagnosis. We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queries with associational evidence; (2) resisting sycophantic drift under adversarial pressure; and (3) generating Wise Refusals that specify missing information when evidence is underdetermined. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, CausalT5K embeds causal traps in realistic narratives and decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing failure modes invisible to aggregate accuracy. Developed through a rigorous human-machine collaborative pipeline involving 40 domain experts, iterative cross-validation cycles, and composite verification via rule-based, LLM, and human scoring, CausalT5K implements Pearl's Ladder of Causation as research infrastructure. Preliminary experiments reveal a Four-Quadrant Control Landscape where static audit policies universally fail, a finding that demonstrates CausalT5K's value for advancing trustworthy reasoning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08948v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on test-time scaling via parallel decoding (for example, 512 samples) to boost reasoning accuracy, but this incurs substantial compute. We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08968v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World Models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning compact, predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling agents to reason, plan, and generalize beyond direct experience. Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08990v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce InternAgent-1.5, a unified system designed for end-to-end scientific discovery across computational and empirical domains. The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving complex mathematical problems, yet they still fall short of producing accurate and consistent solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\% and 79.64\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence can be viewed as an evolution of data-driven learning paradigms, with successive shifts in data organization and utilization continuously driving advances in model capability. Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06966v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driven by breakthroughs in next-generation artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence is rapidly advancing into industrial manufacturing. In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06967v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-robot collaboration tasks often require heterogeneous robots to work together over long horizons under spatial constraints and environmental uncertainties. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06968v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and real-time 6-DoF localization is mission-critical for autonomous lunar landing, yet existing approaches remain limited: visual odometry (VO) drifts unboundedly, while map-based absolute localization fails in texture-sparse or low-light terrain. We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion. On both realistic synthetic and real lunar landing datasets, KANLoc reduces average translation and rotation error by 32% and 45%, respectively, with per-trajectory gains of up to 45%/48%, outperforming strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of drones into the medical field has revolutionized healthcare delivery by enabling rapid transportation of medical supplies, organs, and even emergency assistance in remote or disaster-stricken areas. While other survey papers focus on the healthcare supply chain, operations, and medical emergency response aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive review of medical drones from the perspectives of flight dynamics and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations. With these considerations, this survey aims to provide insights into optimizing GNC frameworks for medical drones, emphasizing research gaps and directions to improve real-world healthcare applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As hardware and software systems have grown in complexity, formal methods have been indispensable tools for rigorously specifying acceptable behaviors, synthesizing programs to meet these specifications, and validating the correctness of existing programs. In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06974v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual navigation for robotics is inspired by the human ability to navigate environments using visual cues and memory, eliminating the need for detailed maps. In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precise handling of chemical instruments and materials within a self-driving laboratory environment using robotic systems demands advanced and reliable control strategies. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose a RGB-D SLAM system that reconstructs a language-aligned dense feature field while sustaining low-latency tracking and mapping. First, we introduce a Top-K Rendering pipeline, a high-throughput and semantic-distortion-free method for efficiently rendering high-dimensional feature maps. To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS. Our results demonstrate that online SLAM with dense, uncompressed language-aligned feature fields is both feasible and effective, bridging the gap between 3D perception and language-based reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.06995v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The availability of commercial wireless communication and sensing equipment combined with the advancements in intelligent autonomous systems paves the way towards robust joint communications and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07005v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self driving laboratories (SDLs) are highly automated research environments that leverage advanced technologies to conduct experiments and analyze data with minimal human involvement. These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring functional safety is essential for the deployment of Embodied AI in complex open-world environments. However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks. Overall, this work paves the way for systematic and grounded functional safety requirement generation, a critical step toward the safe industrial deployment of Embodied AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07074v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper develops a real-time, search-based aircraft contingency landing planner that minimizes traffic disruptions while accounting for ground risk. The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Passive dynamic walkers are widely adopted as a mathematical model to represent biped walking. The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach. We provide extensive simulation analysis investigating the locomotion speed, mechanical cost of transport, and basin of attraction of the proposed model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07209v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Localization and mapping of an environment are crucial tasks for any robot operating in unstructured environments. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2{\deg} in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have catalyzed research in Embodied AI to develop interactive agents capable of environmental reasoning and interaction. Developing such agents requires diverse, large-scale datasets. Prior frameworks generate synthetic data for long-term human-robot interactions but fail to model the bidirectional influence between human behavior and household environments. Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.   The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods. Our flexible tool allows users to define dataset characteristics via natural language prompts, enabling configuration of environment and human activity data through natural language specifications. The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.   We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences. These contributions enable development and testing of household smart devices at scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly transforming multiple applications, from agricultural and infrastructure monitoring to logistics and defense. Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term "simulation-to-reality gap". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot. We show that it supports over 20x faster-than-real-time, end-to-end simulation of a complete development and deployment stack -- including edge compute and networking -- significantly compressing the build-test-release cycle of perception-based autonomy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently achieved remarkable success in robotics by formulating action prediction as a conditional denoising process. However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling. Project site: https://lorenzo-0-0.github.io/A2A_Flow_Matching.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07326v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Grasping under limited sensing remains a fundamental challenge for real-world robotic manipulation, as vision and high-resolution tactile sensors often introduce cost, fragility, and integration complexity. This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07363v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quadruped robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured environments. Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative model-based policies have shown strong performance in imitation-based robotic manipulation by learning action distributions from demonstrations. However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07413v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There has been rapid and dramatic progress in robots' ability to learn complex visuo-motor manipulation skills from demonstrations, thanks in part to expressive policy classes that employ diffusion- and transformer-based backbones. However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07434v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction requires emotionally rich multimodal expressions, yet most humanoid robots lack coordinated speech, facial expressions, and gestures. Meanwhile, real-world deployment demands on-device solutions that can operate autonomously without continuous cloud connectivity. To bridging \underline{\textit{S}}peech, \underline{\textit{E}}motion, and \underline{\textit{M}}otion, we present \textit{SeM$^2$}, a Vision Language Model-based framework that orchestrates emotionally coherent multimodal interactions through three key components: a multimodal perception module capturing user contextual cues, a Chain-of-Thought reasoning for response planning, and a novel Semantic-Sequence Aligning Mechanism (SSAM) that ensures precise temporal coordination between verbal content and physical expressions. We implement both cloud-based and \underline{\textit{e}}dge-deployed versions (\textit{SeM$^2_e$}), with the latter knowledge distilled to operate efficiently on edge hardware while maintaining 95\% of the relative performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in naturalness, emotional clarity, and modal coherence, advancing socially expressive humanoid robotics for diverse real-world environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in humanoid whole-body motion tracking have enabled the execution of diverse and highly coordinated motions on real hardware. However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07506v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humanoid facial expression shadowing enables robots to realistically imitate human facial expressions in real time, which is critical for lifelike, facially expressive humanoid robots and affective human-robot interaction. Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations. Extensive real-world demonstrations validate its practical utility. Videos are available at: https://lipzh5.github.io/VividFace/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As robots are expected to perform increasingly diverse tasks, they must understand not only low-level actions but also the higher-level structure that determines how a task should unfold. Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with this form of task-level reasoning. They either depend on prompt-based in-context decomposition, which is unstable and sensitive to linguistic variations, or end-to-end long-horizon training, which requires large-scale demonstrations and entangles task-level reasoning with low-level control. We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07598v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The presentation of a robot's capability and identity directly influences a human collaborator's perception and implicit trust in the robot. Unlike humans, a physical robot can simultaneously present different identities and have them reside and control different parts of the robot. This paper presents a novel study that investigates how users perceive a robot where different robot control domains (head and gripper) are presented as independent robots. We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant. Participants perceived the robot as residing in the different control domains and were able to associate robot failure with different identities. This work signals how future robots can leverage different embodiment configurations to obtain the benefit of multiple robots within a single body.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07629v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose LCLA (Language-Conditioned Latent Alignment), a framework for vision-language navigation that learns modular perception-action interfaces by aligning sensory observations to a latent representation of an expert policy. The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper develops the proof of concept for a novel affine transformable unmanned ground vehicle (ATUGV) with the capability of safe and aggressive deformation while carrying multiple payloads. The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07736v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting symmetry is crucial for effective object grasping for several reasons. Recognizing symmetrical features or axes within an object helps in developing efficient grasp strategies, as grasping along these axes typically results in a more stable and balanced grip, thereby facilitating successful manipulation. This paper employs geometrical moments to identify symmetries and estimate orthogonal transformations, including rotations and mirror transformations, for objects centered at the frame origin. It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \( n \)-tuples. Extensive validation tests are conducted on both 2D and 3D objects to ensure the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. The proposed method is also compared to state-of-the-art work using iterative optimization for detecting multiple planes of symmetry. The results indicate that combining our method with the iterative one yields satisfactory outcomes in terms of the number of symmetry planes detected and computation time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we address vision-language-guided multi-robot cooperative transport, where each robot grounds natural-language instructions from onboard camera observations. A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots. The demonstration video is available at https://sites.google.com/view/colf/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online policy learning directly in the physical world is a promising yet challenging direction for embodied intelligence. Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07846v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image guided robotic navigation systems often rely on reference based geometric perception pipelines, where accurate spatial mapping is established through multi stage estimation processes. In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Camera pose estimation from sparse correspondences is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision and remains particularly challenging in near-field scenarios, where strong perspective effects and heterogeneous measurement noise can significantly degrade the stability of analytic PnP solutions. In this paper, we present a geometric error propagation framework for camera pose estimation based on a parallel perspective approximation. By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight the importance of explicit geometric error modeling for reliable camera pose estimation in challenging near-field settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern autonomous vehicles and robots utilize versatile sensors for localization and mapping. The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-Agent Route Planning considers selecting vehicles, each associated with a single predefined route, such that the spatial coverage of a road network is increased while redundant overlaps are limited. This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Securing petroleum infrastructure requires balancing autonomous system efficiency with human judgment for threat escalation, a challenge unaddressed by classical facility location models assuming homogeneous resources. This paper formulates the Human-Robot Co-Dispatch Facility Location Problem (HRCD-FLP), a capacitated facility location variant incorporating tiered infrastructure criticality, human-robot supervision ratio constraints, and minimum utilization requirements. We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible. From systems perspective, our work demonstrate that optimized planning for human-robot teaming is key to achieve both cost-effective and mission-reliable deployments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07932v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planning over unstructured terrain presents a significant challenge in the field of legged robotics. Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.07984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulation is crucial in the development of autonomous driving software. In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023. They show the fastest fully autonomous lap of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, with vehicle speeds reaching 267 kph and lateral accelerations of up to 15 mps2.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ability to dynamically manipulate interaction between cables, carried by pairs of aerial vehicles attached to the ends of each cable, can greatly improve the versatility and agility of cable-assisted aerial manipulation. Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input. Numerical simulations validate our approach, demonstrating stable, high-speed tracking of dynamic references.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet current methods rely on rigid templates to specify reasoning primitives (e.g., objects in the scene, high-level plans, structural affordances). These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&amp;B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&amp;B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives. R&amp;B-EnCoRe enables models to distill reasoning that is predictive of successful control, bypassing manual annotation engineering while grounding internet-scale knowledge in physical execution.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08245v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for visuomotor control in robotic manipulation due to their ability to model the distribution of action sequences and capture multimodality. However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08251v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial manipulation (AM) promises to move Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) beyond passive inspection to contact-rich tasks such as grasping, assembly, and in-situ maintenance. Most prior AM demonstrations rely on external motion capture (MoCap) and emphasize position control for coarse interactions, limiting deployability. We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap. The main components are (1) an augmented visual-inertial odometry (VIO) estimator with contact-consistency factors that activate only during interaction, tightening uncertainty around the contact frame and reducing drift, and (2) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to mitigate perception-control coupling, together with a hybrid force-motion controller that regulates contact wrenches and lateral motion for stable contact. Experiments show that our approach closes the perception-to-wrench loop using only onboard sensing, yielding an velocity estimation improvement of 66.01% at contact, reliable target approach, and stable force holding-pointing toward deployable, in-the-wild aerial manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In cluttered scenes with inevitable occlusions and incomplete observations, selecting informative viewpoints is essential for building a reliable representation. In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains one of the most challenging problems in robotics, requiring coherent control of high-DoF hands and arms under complex, contact-rich dynamics. A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Climate change, invasive species and human activities are currently damaging the world's coral reefs at unprecedented rates, threatening their vast biodiversity and fisheries, and reducing coastal protection. Solving this vast challenge requires scalable coral regeneration technologies that can breed climate-resilient species and accelerate the natural regrowth processes; actions that are impeded by the absence of safe and robust tools to handle the fragile coral. We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize global transportation systems. However, its widespread acceptance and market penetration remain significantly below expectations. This gap is primarily driven by persistent challenges in safety, comfort, commuting efficiency and energy economy when compared to the performance of experienced human drivers. We hypothesize that these challenges can be addressed through the development of a driver foundation model (DFM). Accordingly, we propose a framework for establishing DFMs to comprehensively benchmark AVs. Specifically, we describe a large-scale dataset collection strategy for training a DFM, discuss the core functionalities such a model should possess, and explore potential technical solutions to realize these functionalities. We further present the utility of the DFM across the operational spectrum, from defining human-centric safety envelopes to establishing benchmarks for energy economy. Overall, We aim to formalize the DFM concept and introduce a new paradigm for the systematic specification, verification and validation of AVs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08326v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driving without considering the preferred separation distance from surrounding vehicles may cause discomfort for users. To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial insects can effortlessly navigate dense vegetation, whereas similarly sized aerial robots typically depend on offboard sensors and computation to maintain stable flight. This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planning under uncertainty for real-world robotics tasks, such as autonomous driving, requires reasoning in enormous high-dimensional belief spaces, rendering the problem computationally intensive. While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\times$--$1073\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking. Evaluated on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks, Vec-QMDP achieves state-of-the-art planning performance with millisecond-level latency, establishing CPUs as a high-performance computing platform for large-scale planning under uncertainty.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08370v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Realizing versatile and human-like performance in high-demand sports like badminton remains a formidable challenge for humanoid robotics. Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a "mimic" to a capable "striker." Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors. Crucially, to overcome the sparsity of expert demonstrations, we introduce a manifold expansion strategy that generalizes discrete strike points into a dense interaction volume. We validate our framework through the mastery of diverse skills, including lifts and drop shots, in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of anthropomorphic badminton skills to a humanoid robot, successfully replicating the kinetic elegance and functional precision of human athletes in the physical world.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08392v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08417v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Map-based LiDAR pose tracking is essential for long-term autonomous operation, where onboard map priors need be compact for scalable storage and fast retrieval, while online observations are often partial, repetitive, and heavily occluded. We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear. Experiments on public benchmarks, controlled stress tests, and real-world deployments demonstrate accurate and stable tracking with KB-level priors from heterogeneous map sources, including under geometrically degenerate and sustained occlusion and in the presence of gradual scene changes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08421v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for transforming natural language user intents into executable actions. This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, and the proposed aggregation method outperforms other aggregation methods currently in use.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is imperative yet challenging for robots to execute complex tasks, requiring coordinated collaboration between two arms. However, existing methods for bimanual manipulation often rely on costly data collection and training, struggling to generalize to unseen objects in novel categories efficiently. In this paper, we present Bi-Adapt, a novel framework designed for efficient generalization for bimanual manipulation via semantic correspondence. Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08440v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-collision trajectory restoration is a safety-critical capability for autonomous vehicles, as impact-induced lateral motion and yaw transients can rapidly drive the vehicle away from the intended path. This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.

The results demonstrate that a tightly coupled approach enables reliable detection of floating targets under realistic uncertainties and complex environmental conditions, providing concrete insights for future autonomous maritime search and rescue applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08466v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-guided robotic systems are increasingly deployed in precision alignment tasks that require reliable execution under near-field and off-axis configurations. While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Various musculoskeletal humanoids have been developed so far, and numerous studies on control mechanisms have been conducted to leverage the advantages of their biomimetic bodies. However, there has not been sufficient and unified discussion on the diverse properties inherent in these musculoskeletal structures, nor on how to manage and utilize them. Therefore, this study categorizes and analyzes the characteristics of muscles, as well as their management and utilization methods, based on the various research conducted on the musculoskeletal humanoids we have developed, Kengoro and Musashi. We classify the features of the musculoskeletal structure into five properties: Redundancy, Independency, Anisotropy, Variable Moment Arm, and Nonlinear Elasticity. We then organize the diverse advantages and disadvantages of musculoskeletal humanoids that arise from the combination of these properties. In particular, we discuss body schema learning and reflex control, along with muscle grouping and body schema adaptation. Also, we describe the implementation of movements through an integrated system and discuss future challenges and prospects.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Integration of VLM reasoning with symbolic planning has proven to be a promising approach to real-world robot task planning. Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08557v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider how model-based solvers can be leveraged to guide training of a universal policy to control from any feasible start state to any feasible goal in a contact-rich manipulation setting. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08594v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalist humanoid motion trackers have recently achieved strong simulation metrics by scaling data and training, yet often remain brittle on hardware during sustained teleoperation due to interface- and dynamics-induced errors. We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning. We validate MOSAIC with systematic ablations, out-of-distribution benchmarking, and real-robot experiments demonstrating robust offline motion replay and online long-horizon teleoperation under realistic latency and noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial manipulation requires force-aware capabilities to enable safe and effective grasping and physical interaction. Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08602v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) has achieved impressive success in dexterous manipulation through generative modeling and pretraining, state-of-the-art approaches like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still struggle with adaptation to environmental changes and skill transfer. We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex missions that demand reliable autonomous navigation and robust obstacle avoidance. However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization, enabling reliable high-speed navigation in dense clutter and challenging outdoor forest environments at velocities up to 7.5m/s.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Teleoperation inherently relies on the human operator acting as a closed-loop controller to actively compensate for hardware imperfections, including latency, mechanical friction, and lack of explicit force feedback. Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to "Intent Cloning" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a "virtual equilibrium point", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08799v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Function offloading is a promising solution to address limitations concerning computational capacity and available energy of Connected Automated Vehicles~(CAVs) or other autonomous robots by distributing computational tasks between local and remote computing devices in form of distributed services. This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a family of finite-time controllers for the bilateral teleoperation of fully actuated nonlinear Euler-Lagrange systems. Based on the energy-shaping framework and under the standard assumption of passive interactions with the human and the environment, the controllers ensure that the position error and velocities globally converge to zero in the absence of time delays. In this case, the closed-loop system admits a homogeneous approximation of negative degree, and thus the control objective is achieved in finite-time. The proposed controllers are simple, continuous-time proportional-plus-damping-injection schemes, validated through both simulation and experimental results.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model-based controllers can offer strong guarantees on stability and convergence by relying on physically accurate dynamic models. However, these are rarely available for high-dimensional mechanical systems such as deformable objects or soft robots. While neural architectures can learn to approximate complex dynamics, they are either limited to low-dimensional systems or provide only limited formal control guarantees due to a lack of embedded physical structure. This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics. By quantifying the sources of modeling error, we derive interpretable conditions for stability and convergence. We extend the proposed controller and analysis to underactuated systems by introducing learned actuation patterns. Experimental results on simulated and real-world systems validate our theoretical investigation and the accuracy of our controllers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.08999v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the increasing integration of robots into daily life, human-robot interaction has become more complex and multifaceted. A critical component of this interaction is Interactive Visual Grounding (IVG), through which robots must interpret human intentions and resolve ambiguity. Existing IVG models generally lack a mechanism to determine when to ask clarification questions, as they implicitly rely on their learned representations. CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens. We train on a real-world interactive dataset for IVG, and a mixed ambiguity set for the detector. With InViG-only supervision, our model surpasses a state-of-the-art method while using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Similarly, the ambiguity detector outperforms prior baselines. Overall, CLUE turns the internal cross-modal attention of a VLM into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09002v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Navigating socially in human environments requires more than satisfying geometric constraints, as collision-free paths may still interfere with ongoing activities or conflict with social norms. Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09013v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09018v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $\chi_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $\chi_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $\chi_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $\pi_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.09023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.
