- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25797v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements, partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5 achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively, highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25897v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing, we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO, achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training. We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25921v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges. Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models. Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed STM systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space, generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT), allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image. BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25990v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored: (i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii) foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1 b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations, and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300 epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26001v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively, capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies, failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies. In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description, explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations, their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators, although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly 20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the growing impacts of climate change.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge. Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are available at: https://alirasekh.github.io/STAVEQ2/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26049v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL) framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks, especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content. Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of PReMA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26125v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks. Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes. However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications. Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space, each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution, enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26149v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However, acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need for actual radiology reports.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26154v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation, rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto (pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of 1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26160v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26186v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models. ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures, backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions. ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The product classification and edge classification are performed using the SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4 product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37% is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet, while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code, models, and dataset will be publicly released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially, under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks, which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics, compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50 consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains, especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26292v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However, prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly, CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and was honored with the Innovation Award.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26294v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images, and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from 9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of 1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on the UFPR dataset to date.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and $16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to $300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling. Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each component.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer (ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them (\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability for feature fusion and decision-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion (PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters, overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result, scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen. Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR) while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26412v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation (LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos, LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc. Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26441v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability, trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably, our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\% occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs 82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26464v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images. However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance, which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26466v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores. Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26509v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant improvements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI), plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly, the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions, which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network (SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at https://github.com/taetiseo09/SA2Net.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26569v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26580v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings. This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios. The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors. Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However, their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26583v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution, intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained, large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26614v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches, specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the properties of event cameras.

In the backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module to enhance feature extraction for small objects. Additionally,we design the Median-Frequency Feature Fusion (MFFF) module,which effectively improves the model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information. Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features, thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the VisDrone2019 dataset with lower computational complexity and fewer parameters, demonstrating its robustness and feasibility for small-object detection tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26641v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation, climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images, has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion, which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations, offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

In this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction, selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition, our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future directions for research and practical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26684v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources. By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional, 4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for 3D vision and graphics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26769v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points. Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through activation engineering.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26778v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images, a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques, encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in this paper is made freely available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26786v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26794v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset covering a large part of Europe.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26796v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26799v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception, generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26802v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs, establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices, including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions, Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.

This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25793v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases, leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile? We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit, validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25796v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL) approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018) from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4% versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators. Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1% compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25798v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Recently, a widely adopted approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models. Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior performance of FreLE. Code is available at https://github.com/Chenxing-Xuan/FreLE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25801v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25803v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40% reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts. However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and (3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget, resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33 instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/PRESTO

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25867v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable, high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema; a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA, outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25889v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.   We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration.   We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6% to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to 85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks, demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.   Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online RL for flow-based VLAs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines, replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low label rates.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25926v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy, uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However, state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed, unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or pretrained representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25934v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free, black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss (KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25952v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub (https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25954v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage, necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13 of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average 5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63), new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64, 0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25962v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless application of neural network architectures in optimization by re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional, graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key (possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN) settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25983v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation, despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but from the learning of structured density ratios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them - even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives - eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a broad ecosystem of solvers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC) framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation. However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling efficient online learning at the edge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods (e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms, provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold. Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements over existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26025v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to 85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240 expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops 10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring genuine human-AI collaboration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing'' capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale. Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better debiasing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of $\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of SR models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology, thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data, while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of "data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26076v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications. By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72 studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation. We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data solutions for the financial domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26083v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26086v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.   In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3) progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than 38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based bisection method.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections (hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26099v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints: territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26109v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently. However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26146v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal, delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model, termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52% to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26148v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments. This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture, adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time, privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and pervasive computing environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information. However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks, highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26159v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features, clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26184v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources, including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of individual resources independently, without considering their capacity constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26185v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups, and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform those cleaned with SGD-IE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers, providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the patients.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards. AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26230v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence. This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model). Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability, scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the performance of the output in a more practical setting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance, underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically, we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models and datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions. This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations. Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity. In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques, highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation across multi-bandits.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26301v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover, real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences. For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm, A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential, language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text, proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially, token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26303v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation. Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$ close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while Signum remains invariant.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1) generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2) inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI), inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and compatibility across multiple CL settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26323v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem, enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training as quantum devices scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26324v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior $p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general.   To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an $L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure, since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign, task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26342v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables, interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset (Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3 exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs, ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be costly to identify.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward. This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning, and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26350v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology. However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs), still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time, undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures, have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains, current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26353v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites. Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status. However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical. Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS, a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26376v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation, initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts. While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20 days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers, distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of atmosphere-climate dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football (GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

While deep learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor, and effectiveness with small datasets.   This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.   Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26433v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM, while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning, establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine. However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to 74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes. Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity. Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy degradation.   To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations, evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

We introduce in this work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models. Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware, where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26491v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based, lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop \textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy \text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy. Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection. However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models, Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most 512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21 percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer, more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26510v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets. ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR paradigm for LRMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26527v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper, we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework, underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from $3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across diverse learning settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large, high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework, the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization, potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26557v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously, requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26560v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks (Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and architecture-specific approaches instead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26566v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs, which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration. First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing multiclass calibration techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure, while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability. Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating surfaces and more complex structures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and (iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning, serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/Flnny/Delay-data

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26633v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However, BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains. Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly, we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow or complex algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26643v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26645v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data. We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$ and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas prior private algorithms failed to do so.   In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including planted problems in graphs.   We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular, we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26690v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA. Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26704v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a stable and interpretable way.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26706v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems. However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses. Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

However, existing gradient compressors face notable limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper, we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions. Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance of Top-$K$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically. Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training. We therefore recommend that empirical comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26715v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A vast majority of mass spectrometry data remains uncharacterized, leaving much of its biological and chemical information untapped. Recent advances in machine learning have begun to address this gap, particularly for tasks such as spectral identification in tandem mass spectrometry data. Here, we present the latest generation of LSM-MS2, a large-scale deep learning foundation model trained on millions of spectra to learn a semantic chemical space. LSM-MS2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral identification, improving on existing methods by 30% in accuracy of identifying challenging isomeric compounds, yielding 42% more correct identifications in complex biological samples, and maintaining robustness under low-concentration conditions. Furthermore, LSM-MS2 produces rich spectral embeddings that enable direct biological interpretation from minimal downstream data, successfully differentiating disease states and predicting clinical outcomes across diverse translational applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26717v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of \cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves optimal error in spectral norm.   For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$, improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private} and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of \cite{dong2022differentially}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26745v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.   From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.   Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization, by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose \textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence} dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data. By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures, demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization methods including recent feature transformations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models? Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26777v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26782v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven labor automation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26788v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16 uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens. Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq 2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters, revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns. In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience. We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern: scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC) gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25860v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks: (1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM raters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands. The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression mechanically selects for generative, causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain: from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement, efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems, addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25884v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge, as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications, such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25908v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness, scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel, open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs, including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific contexts.

FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights, and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp). When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model (Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources are tabulated in Appendix E.   Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance (epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance ($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100; non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.   TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within $\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains (Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases, and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries, where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35 natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation, iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework, autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future research on automated scholarly writing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention (which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers, then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26094v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes *LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*, a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4 repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench* and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26098v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface (GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26136v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity. We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0, we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26143v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic, requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&amp;D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics, SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup, respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26242v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26270v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks, GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated. IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore, we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26374v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training. Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates \emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and \emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26380v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves, rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++, where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26396v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a "Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools -- such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns" that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26402v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student thinking or learning needs.   Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities: automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.   In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks, the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on 1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling, allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.   By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26411v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP, a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features. Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26418v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench, CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively - far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to facilitate replication.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26481v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2 (GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity. Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26486v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans, leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an important safety problem that is already challenging for humans: fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone. Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation, confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets: (a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k (general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance, except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C, GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings, cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain, allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26658v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26721v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).   We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics, Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The 19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3 30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across architectural diversity.   The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26752v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic "filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections, presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25850v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising new paradigm for automated robot design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation--specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.25965v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However, most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load, achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling dependable performance across real-world applications.

However, methods rooted in this approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor. These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of stabilization time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26004v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26018v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art. This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent trained just to race.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26080v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency. Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot discontinuation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse, extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot), or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley, elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26132v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology, material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper, we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning, enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states. Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% - 1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26142v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages while maintaining rapid planning performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets. Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating, penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases, PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at https://davian-robotics.github.io/PHUMA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However, enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack (130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26358v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring robust multimodal perception.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26362v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work, represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while giving pointers towards potential future applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26363v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed. To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability, scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26551v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across diverse tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26588v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity, configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators: maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across diverse platforms and scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction for future research in this area.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26638v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC) created the Space Resources Challenge to invite researchers and companies to propose innovative solutions for Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) space prospection. This paper proposes the Resilient Exploration And Lunar Mapping System 2 (REALMS2), a MRS framework for planetary prospection and mapping. Based on Robot Operating System version 2 (ROS 2) and enhanced with Visual Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (vSLAM) for map generation, REALMS2 uses a mesh network for a robust ad hoc network. A single graphical user interface (GUI) controls all the rovers, providing a simple overview of the robotic mission. This system is designed for heterogeneous multi-robot exploratory missions, tackling the challenges presented by extraterrestrial environments. REALMS2 was used during the second field test of the ESA-ESRIC Challenge and allowed to map around 60% of the area, using three homogeneous rovers while handling communication delays and blackouts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26646v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance, action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics, including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines (DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26656v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26670v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However, approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.26742v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLA. Code is available at https://github.com/Dexmal/realtime-vla.
