- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant promise for revolutionizing traditional education and reducing teachers' workload. However, accurately interpreting unconstrained STEM student handwritten solutions with intertwined mathematical formulas, diagrams, and textual reasoning poses a significant challenge due to the lack of authentic and domain-specific benchmarks. Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00096v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The scalability of embodied intelligence is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of real-world interaction data. While simulation platforms provide a promising alternative, existing approaches often suffer from a substantial visual and physical gap to real environments and rely on expensive sensors, precise robot calibration, or depth measurements, limiting their practicality at scale. We present Simulate Anything, a graphics-driven world modeling and simulation framework that enables efficient generation of high-fidelity embodied training data using only multi-view environment videos and off-the-shelf assets. Our approach reconstructs real-world environments into a photorealistic scene representation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), seamlessly capturing fine-grained geometry and appearance from video. We then leverage generative models to recover a physically realistic representation and integrate it into a simulation environment via a precision calibration target, enabling accurate scale alignment between the reconstructed scene and the real world. Together, these components provide a unified, editable, and physically grounded world model. Vision Language Action (VLA) models trained on our simulated data achieve strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, matching or even surpassing results obtained with real-world data, highlighting the potential of reconstruction-driven world modeling for scalable and practical embodied intelligence training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00104v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-centric retrieval for VQA requires retrieving images to supply missing visual cues and integrating them into the reasoning process. However, selecting the right images and integrating them effectively into the model's reasoning remains challenging.To address this challenge, we propose R3G, a modular Reasoning-Retrieval-Reranking framework.It first produces a brief reasoning plan that specifies the required visual cues, then adopts a two-stage strategy, with coarse retrieval followed by fine-grained reranking, to select evidence images.On MRAG-Bench, R3G improves accuracy across six MLLM backbones and nine sub-scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art overall performance. Ablations show that sufficiency-aware reranking and reasoning steps are complementary, helping the model both choose the right images and use them well. We release code and data at https://github.com/czh24/R3G.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Public demos of image editing models are typically best-case samples; real workflows pay for retries and review time. We introduce HYPE-EDIT-1, a 100-task benchmark of reference-based marketing/design edits with binary pass/fail judging. For each task we generate 10 independent outputs to estimate per-attempt pass rate, pass@10, expected attempts under a retry cap, and an effective cost per successful edit that combines model price with human review time. We release 50 public tasks and maintain a 50-task held-out private split for server-side evaluation, plus a standardized JSON schema and tooling for VLM and human-based judging. Across the evaluated models, per-attempt pass rates span 34-83 percent and effective cost per success spans USD 0.66-1.42. Models that have low per-image pricing are more expensive when you consider the total effective cost of retries and human reviews.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To meet the requirements for managing unauthorized UAVs in the low-altitude economy, a multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction method based on the fusion of LiDAR and millimeter-wave radar information is proposed. A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present SITUATE, a novel dataset designed for training and evaluating Vision Language Models on counting tasks with spatial constraints. The dataset bridges the gap between simple 2D datasets like VLMCountBench and often ambiguous real-life datasets like TallyQA, which lack control over occlusions and spatial composition. Experiments show that our dataset helps to improve generalization for out-of-distribution images, since a finetune of Qwen VL 2.5 7B on SITUATE improves accuracy on the Pixmo count test data, but not vice versa. We cross validate this by comparing the model performance across established other counting benchmarks and against an equally sized fine-tuning set derived from Pixmo count.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00109v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Presentation attack detection (PAD) subsystems are an important part of effective and user-friendly remote identity validation (RIV) systems. However, ensuring robust performance across diverse environmental and procedural conditions remains a critical challenge. This paper investigates the impact of low-light conditions and automated image acquisition on the robustness of commercial PAD systems using a scenario test of RIV. Our results show that PAD systems experience a significant decline in performance when utilized in low-light or auto-capture scenarios, with a model-predicted increase in error rates by a factor of about four under low-light conditions and a doubling of those odds under auto-capture workflows. Specifically, only one of the tested systems was robust to these perturbations, maintaining a maximum bona fide presentation classification error rate below 3% across all scenarios. Our findings emphasize the importance of testing across diverse environments to ensure robust and reliable PAD performance in real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual transformers have driven major progress in remote sensing image analysis, particularly in object detection and segmentation. Recent vision-language and multimodal models further extend these capabilities by incorporating auxiliary information, including captions, question and answer pairs, and metadata, which broadens applications beyond conventional computer vision tasks. However, these models are typically optimized for semantic alignment between visual and textual content rather than geospatial understanding, and therefore are not suited for representing or reasoning with structured geospatial layers. In this study, we propose a novel model that enhances remote sensing imagery processing with guidance from auxiliary geospatial information. Our approach introduces a geospatial embedding mechanism that transforms diverse geospatial data into embedding patches that are spatially aligned with image patches. To facilitate cross-modal interaction, we design a guided attention module that dynamically integrates multimodal information by computing attention weights based on correlations with auxiliary data, thereby directing the model toward the most relevant regions. In addition, the module assigns distinct roles to individual attention heads, allowing the model to capture complementary aspects of the guidance information and improving the interpretability of its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing pretrained geospatial foundation models in predicting disease prevalence, highlighting its effectiveness in multimodal geospatial understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00111v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Play behaviour serves as a positive welfare indicator in dairy calves, yet the influence of space allowance under commercial conditions remains poorly characterized, particularly at intermediate-to-high allowances (6-20 m2 per calf). This study investigated the relationship between space allowance and play behaviour in 60 group-housed dairy calves across 14 commercial farms in the Netherlands (space range: 2.66-17.98 m2 per calf), and developed an automated computer vision pipeline for scalable monitoring. Video observations were analyzed using a detailed ethogram, with play expressed as percentage of observation period (%OP). Statistical analysis employed linear mixed models with farm as a random effect. A computer vision pipeline was trained on manual annotations from 108 hours on 6 farms and validated on held-out test data. The computer vision classifier achieved 97.6% accuracy with 99.4% recall for active play detection. Calves spent on average 1.0% of OP playing reflecting around 10 minutes per 17-hour period. The space-play relationship was non-linear, with highest play levels at 8-10 m2 per calf (1.6% OP) and lowest at 6-8 m2 and 12-14 m2 (<0.6% OP). Space remained significant after controlling for age, health, and group size. In summary, these findings suggest that 8-10 m2 per calf represents a practical target balancing welfare benefits with economic feasibility, and demonstrate that automated monitoring can scale small annotation projects to continuous welfare assessment systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate, reproducible burn assessment is critical for treatment planning, healing monitoring, and medico-legal documentation, yet conventional visual inspection and 2D photography are subjective and limited for longitudinal comparison. This paper presents an AI-enabled burn assessment and management platform that integrates multi-view photogrammetry, 3D surface reconstruction, and deep learning-based segmentation within a structured clinical workflow. Using standard multi-angle images from consumer-grade cameras, the system reconstructs patient-specific 3D burn surfaces and maps burn regions onto anatomy to compute objective metrics in real-world units, including surface area, TBSA, depth-related geometric proxies, and volumetric change. Successive reconstructions are spatially aligned to quantify healing progression over time, enabling objective tracking of wound contraction and depth reduction. The platform also supports structured patient intake, guided image capture, 3D analysis and visualization, treatment recommendations, and automated report generation. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates stable reconstructions, consistent metric computation, and clinically plausible longitudinal trends, supporting a scalable, non-invasive approach to objective, geometry-aware burn assessment and decision support in acute and outpatient care.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) challenges model generalization to novel classes based on just a few shots of labeled examples, a testbed where traditional test-time augmentations fail to be effective. We introduce 1S-DAug, a one-shot generative augmentation operator that synthesizes diverse yet faithful variants from just one example image at test time. 1S-DAug couples traditional geometric perturbations with controlled noise injection and a denoising diffusion process conditioned on the original image. The generated images are then encoded and aggregated, alongside the original image, into a combined representation for more robust FSL predictions. Integrated as a training-free model-agnostic plugin, 1S-DAug consistently improves FSL across standard benchmarks of 4 different datasets without any model parameter update, including achieving over 10% proportional accuracy improvement on the miniImagenet 5-way-1-shot benchmark. Codes will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00115v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel asynchronous, event-driven algorithm for real-time detection of small event clusters in event camera data. Like other hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms, the algorithm detects the event clusters based on their tempo-spatial distance. However, the algorithm leverages the special asynchronous data structure of event camera, and by a sophisticated, efficient and simple decision-making, enjoys a linear complexity of $O(n)$ where $n$ is the events amount. In addition, the run-time of the algorithm is independent with the dimensions of the pixels array.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite recent advances in computer vision, Earth Observation (EO) analysis remains difficult to perform for the laymen, requiring expert knowledge and technical capabilities. Furthermore, many systems return black-box predictions that are difficult to audit or reproduce. Leveraging recent advances in tool LLMs, this study proposes a conversational, code-generating agent that transforms natural-language queries into executable, auditable Python workflows. The agent operates over a unified easily extendable API for classification, segmentation, detection (oriented bounding boxes), spectral indices, and geospatial operators. With our proposed framework, it is possible to control the results at three levels: (i) tool-level performance on public EO benchmarks; (ii) at the agent-level to understand the capacity to generate valid, hallucination-free code; and (iii) at the task-level on specific use cases. In this work, we select two use-cases of interest: land-composition mapping and post-wildfire damage assessment. The proposed agent outperforms general-purpose LLM/VLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaVA), achieving 64.2% vs. 51.7% accuracy on land-composition and 50% vs. 0% on post-wildfire analysis, while producing results that are transparent and easy to interpret. By outputting verifiable code, the approach turns EO analysis into a transparent, reproducible process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00122v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, multimodal image editing models have achieved substantial progress, enabling users to manipulate visual content through natural language in a flexible and interactive manner. Nevertheless, an important yet insufficiently explored research direction remains visual document image editing, which involves modifying textual content within images while faithfully preserving the original text style and background context. Existing approaches, including AnyText, GlyphControl, and TextCtrl, predominantly focus on English-language scenarios and documents with relatively sparse textual layouts, thereby failing to adequately address dense, structurally complex documents or non-Latin scripts such as Chinese. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{V}isual \textbf{D}oc \textbf{E}dit Bench(VDE Bench), a rigorously human-annotated and evaluated benchmark specifically designed to assess image editing models on multilingual and complex visual document editing tasks. The benchmark comprises a high-quality dataset encompassing densely textual documents in both English and Chinese, including academic papers, posters, presentation slides, examination materials, and newspapers. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled evaluation framework that systematically quantifies editing performance at the OCR parsing level, enabling fine-grained assessment of text modification accuracy. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative state-of-the-art image editing models. Manual verification demonstrates a strong consistency between human judgments and automated evaluation metrics. VDE Bench constitutes the first systematic benchmark for evaluating image editing models on multilingual and densely textual visual documents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The detection of anomalies is crucial to ensuring the safety and security of maritime vessel traffic surveillance. Although autoencoders are popular for anomaly detection, their effectiveness in identifying collective and contextual anomalies is limited, especially in the maritime domain, where anomalies depend on vessel-specific contexts derived from self-reported AIS messages. To address these limitations, we propose a novel solution: the context-aware autoencoder. By integrating context-specific thresholds, our method improves detection accuracy and reduces computational cost. We compare four context-aware autoencoder variants and a conventional autoencoder using a case study focused on fishing status anomalies in maritime surveillance. Results demonstrate the significant impact of context on reconstruction loss and anomaly detection. The context-aware autoencoder outperforms others in detecting anomalies in time series data. By incorporating context-specific thresholds and recognizing the importance of context in anomaly detection, our approach offers a promising solution to improve accuracy in maritime vessel traffic surveillance systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) is a key ingredient of automated visual inspection in modern manufacturing. The reconstruction-based methods appeal because they have basic architectural design and they process data quickly but they produce oversmoothed results for high-frequency details. As a result, subtle defects are partially reconstructed rather than highlighted, which limits segmentation accuracy. We build on this line of work and introduce D3R-Net, a Dual-Domain Denoising Reconstruction framework that couples a self-supervised 'healing' task with frequency-aware regularization. During training, the network receives synthetically corrupted normal images and is asked to reconstruct the clean targets, which prevents trivial identity mapping and pushes the model to learn the manifold of defect-free textures. In addition to the spatial mean squared error, we employ a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude loss that encourages consistency in the frequency domain. The implementation also allows an optional structural similarity (SSIM) term, which we study in an ablation. On the MVTec AD Hazelnut benchmark, D3R-Net with the FFT loss improves localization consistency over a spatial-only baseline: PRO AUC increases from 0.603 to 0.687, while image-level ROC AUC remains robust. Evaluated across fifteen MVTec categories, the FFT variant raises the average pixel ROC AUC from 0.733 to 0.751 and PRO AUC from 0.417 to 0.468 compared to the MSE-only baseline, at roughly 20 FPS on a single GPU. The network is trained from scratch and uses a lightweight convolutional autoencoder backbone, providing a practical alternative to heavy pre-trained feature embedding methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A significant barrier to the long-term deployment of autonomous socially assistive robots is their inability to both perceive and assist with multiple activities of daily living (ADLs). In this paper, we present the first multimodal deep learning architecture, POVNet+, for multi-activity recognition for socially assistive robots to proactively initiate assistive behaviors. Our novel architecture introduces the use of both ADL and motion embedding spaces to uniquely distinguish between a known ADL being performed, a new unseen ADL, or a known ADL being performed atypically in order to assist people in real scenarios. Furthermore, we apply a novel user state estimation method to the motion embedding space to recognize new ADLs while monitoring user performance. This ADL perception information is used to proactively initiate robot assistive interactions. Comparison experiments with state-of-the-art human activity recognition methods show our POVNet+ method has higher ADL classification accuracy. Human-robot interaction experiments in a cluttered living environment with multiple users and the socially assistive robot Leia using POVNet+ demonstrate the ability of our multi-modal ADL architecture in successfully identifying different seen and unseen ADLs, and ADLs being performed atypically, while initiating appropriate assistive human-robot interactions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00132v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hate Video Detection (HVD) is crucial for online ecosystems. Existing methods assume identical distributions between training (source) and inference (target) data. However, hateful content often evolves into irregular and ambiguous forms to evade censorship, resulting in substantial semantic drift and rendering previously trained models ineffective. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a solution by adapting models during inference to narrow the cross-domain gap, while conventional TTA methods target mild distribution shifts and struggle with the severe semantic drift in HVD. To tackle these challenges, we propose SCANNER, the first TTA framework tailored for HVD. Motivated by the insight that, despite the evolving nature of hateful manifestations, their underlying cores remain largely invariant (i.e., targeting is still based on characteristics like gender, race, etc), we leverage these stable cores as a bridge to connect the source and target domains. Specifically, SCANNER initially reveals the stable cores from the ambiguous layout in evolving hateful content via a principled centroid-guided alignment mechanism. To alleviate the impact of outlier-like samples that are weakly correlated with centroids during the alignment process, SCANNER enhances the prior by incorporating a sample-level adaptive centroid alignment strategy, promoting more stable adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate semantic collapse from overly uniform outputs within clusters, SCANNER introduces an intra-cluster diversity regularization that encourages the cluster-wise semantic richness. Experiments show that SCANNER outperforms all baselines, with an average gain of 4.69% in Macro-F1 over the best.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved impressive performance on various vision-language tasks, but their substantial computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing compression methods often decouple low-rank decomposition and quantization, leading to compounded reconstruction errors, especially in multimodal architectures with cross-modal redundancy. To address this issue, we propose LLaVA-FA, a novel efficient LMM that performs joint low-rank plus quantization approximation in the frequency domain. By leveraging the de-correlation and conjugate symmetry properties of Fourier transform, LLaVA-FA achieves more compact and accurate weight representations. Furthermore, we introduce PolarQuant, a polar-coordinate quantization method tailored for complex matrices, and an optional diagonal calibration (ODC) scheme that eliminates the need for large-scale calibration data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LLaVA-FA outperforms existing efficient multimodal models across multiple benchmarks while maintaining minimal activated parameters and low computational costs, validating its effectiveness as a powerful solution for compressing LMMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) with Vision Transformers (ViTs) faces a major computational bottleneck during the classifier reconstruction phase, where most existing methods rely on costly iterative stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We observe that analytic Regularized Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (RGDA) provides a Bayes-optimal alternative with accuracy comparable to SGD-based classifiers; however, its quadratic inference complexity limits its use in large-scale CIL scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Low-Rank Factorized RGDA (LR-RGDA), a scalable classifier that combines RGDA's expressivity with the efficiency of linear classifiers. By exploiting the low-rank structure of the covariance via the Woodbury matrix identity, LR-RGDA decomposes the discriminant function into a global affine term refined by a low-rank quadratic perturbation, reducing the inference complexity from $\mathcal{O}(Cd^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(d^2 + Crd^2)$, where $C$ is the class number, $d$ the feature dimension, and $r \ll d$ the subspace rank. To mitigate representation drift caused by backbone updates, we further introduce Hopfield-based Distribution Compensator (HopDC), a training-free mechanism that uses modern continuous Hopfield Networks to recalibrate historical class statistics through associative memory dynamics on unlabeled anchors, accompanied by a theoretical bound on the estimation error. Extensive experiments on diverse CIL benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a scalable solution for large-scale class-incremental learning with ViTs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Breast tissue density is a key biomarker of breast cancer risk and a major factor affecting mammographic sensitivity. However, density assessment currently relies almost exclusively on X-ray mammography, an ionizing imaging modality. This study investigates the feasibility of estimating breast density using artificial intelligence over infrared thermal images, offering a non-ionizing imaging approach. The underlying hypothesis is that fibroglandular and adipose tissues exhibit distinct thermophysical and physiological properties, leading to subtle but spatially coherent temperature variations on the breast surface. In this paper, we propose DensiThAI, a multi-view deep learning framework for breast density classification from thermal images. The framework was evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 3,500 women using mammography-derived density labels as reference. Using five standard thermal views, DensiThAI achieved a mean AUROC of 0.73 across 10 random splits, with statistically significant separation between density classes across all splits (p << 0.05). Consistent performance across age cohorts supports the potential of thermal imaging as a non-ionizing approach for breast density assessment with implications for improved patient experience and workflow optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00148v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting physical dynamics from raw visual data remains a major challenge in AI. While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00149v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3-D object detection based on 4-D radar-vision is an important part in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, there are two challenges which need to be faced. First, the 4-D radar point clouds are sparse, leading to poor 3-D representation. Second, vision datas exhibit representation degradation under low-light, long distance detection and dense occlusion scenes, which provides unreliable texture information during fusion stage. To address these issues, a framework named SDCM is proposed, which contains Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for radar-vision 3-D object detection in IoV. Firstly, considering point generation based on Gaussian simulation of key points obtained from 3-D Kernel Density Estimation (3-D KDE), and outline generation based on curvature simulation, Simulated Densifying (SimDen) module is designed to generate dense radar point clouds. Secondly, considering that radar data could provide more real time information than vision data, due to the all-weather property of 4-D radar. Radar Compensatory Mapping (RCM) module is designed to reduce the affects of vision datas' representation degradation. Thirdly, considering that feature tensor difference values contain the effective information of every modality, which could be extracted and modeled for heterogeneity reduction and modalities interaction, Mamba Modeling Interactive Fusion (MMIF) module is designed for reducing heterogeneous and achieving interactive Fusion. Experiment results on the VoD, TJ4DRadSet and Astyx HiRes 2019 dataset show that SDCM achieves best performance with lower parameter quantity and faster inference speed. Our code will be available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale histopathology data have found great success in various fields of computational pathology, but their impact on regressive biomarker prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different sampling strategies and instance bagsizes by ablation studies. Our results highlight the benefits of large-scale histopathological pretraining for more precise and transferable regressive biomarker prediction, showcasing its potential to advance AI-driven precision oncology.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00152v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The demand for accurate on-device pattern recognition in edge applications is intensifying, yet existing approaches struggle to reconcile accuracy with computational constraints. To address this challenge, a resource-aware hierarchical network based on multi-spectral fusion and interpretable modules, namely the Hierarchical Parallel Pseudo-image Enhancement Fusion Network (HPPI-Net), is proposed for real-time, on-device Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Deployed on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller for low-power real-time inference, HPPI-Net achieves 96.70% accuracy while utilizing only 22.3 KiB of RAM and 439.5 KiB of ROM after optimization. HPPI-Net employs a two-layer architecture. The first layer extracts preliminary features using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrograms, while the second layer selectively activates either a dedicated module for stationary activity recognition or a parallel LSTM-MobileNet network (PLMN) for dynamic states. PLMN fuses FFT, Wavelet, and Gabor spectrograms through three parallel LSTM encoders and refines the concatenated features using Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC), thereby offering channel-level interpretability while substantially reducing multiply-accumulate operations. Compared with MobileNetV3, HPPI-Net improves accuracy by 1.22% and reduces RAM usage by 71.2% and ROM usage by 42.1%. These results demonstrate that HPPI-Net achieves a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off and provides explainable predictions, establishing a practical solution for wearable, industrial, and smart home HAR on memory-constrained edge platforms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a lightweight compressed-domain tracking model that operates directly on video streams, without requiring full RGB video decoding. Using motion vectors and transform coefficients from compressed data, our deep model propagates object bounding boxes across frames, achieving a computational speed-up of order up to 3.7 with only a slight 4% mAP@0.5 drop vs RGB baseline on MOTS15/17/20 datasets. These results highlight codec-domain motion modeling efficiency for real-time analytics in large monitoring systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMDs) such as dystonia, tremor, chorea, myoclonus, and tics are disabling motor manifestations across childhood and adulthood. Their fluctuating, intermittent, and frequently co-occurring expressions hinder clinical recognition and longitudinal monitoring, which remain largely subjective and vulnerable to inter-rater variability. Objective and scalable methods to distinguish overlapping HMD phenotypes from routine clinical videos are still lacking. Here, we developed a pose-based machine-learning framework that converts standard outpatient videos into anatomically meaningful keypoint time series and computes kinematic descriptors spanning statistical, temporal, spectral, and higher-order irregularity-complexity features.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents YOLOE-26, a unified framework that integrates the deployment-optimized YOLO26(or YOLOv26) architecture with the open-vocabulary learning paradigm of YOLOE for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation. Building on the NMS-free, end-to-end design of YOLOv26, the proposed approach preserves the hallmark efficiency and determinism of the YOLO family while extending its capabilities beyond closed-set recognition. YOLOE-26 employs a convolutional backbone with PAN/FPN-style multi-scale feature aggregation, followed by end-to-end regression and instance segmentation heads. A key architectural contribution is the replacement of fixed class logits with an object embedding head, which formulates classification as similarity matching against prompt embeddings derived from text descriptions, visual examples, or a built-in vocabulary. To enable efficient open-vocabulary reasoning, the framework incorporates Re-Parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) for zero-overhead text prompting, a Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE) for example-guided segmentation, and Lazy Region Prompt Contrast for prompt-free inference. All prompting modalities operate within a unified object embedding space, allowing seamless switching between text-prompted, visual-prompted, and fully autonomous segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent scaling behavior and favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across model sizes in both prompted and prompt-free settings. The training strategy leverages large-scale detection and grounding datasets with multi-task optimization and remains fully compatible with the Ultralytics ecosystem for training, validation, and deployment. Overall, YOLOE-26 provides a practical and scalable solution for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation in dynamic, real-world environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00174v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose an intra-class subdivision pixel contrastive learning (SPCL) framework for cardiac image segmentation to address representation contamination at boundaries. The novel concept ``Unconcerned sample'' is proposed to distinguish pixel representations at the inner and boundary regions within the same class, facilitating a clearer characterization of intra-class variations. A novel boundary contrastive loss for boundary representations is proposed to enhance representation discrimination across boundaries. The advantages of the unconcerned sample and boundary contrastive loss are analyzed theoretically. Experimental results in public cardiac datasets demonstrate that SPCL significantly improves segmentation performance, outperforming existing methods with respect to segmentation quality and boundary precision. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jrstud203/SPCL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion posterior sampling solves inverse problems by combining a pretrained diffusion prior with measurement-consistency guidance, but it often fails to recover fine details because measurement terms are applied in a manner that is weakly coupled to the diffusion noise level. At high noise, data-consistency gradients computed from inaccurate estimates can be geometrically incongruent with the posterior geometry, inducing early-step drift, spurious high-frequency artifacts, plus sensitivity to schedules and ill-conditioned operators. To address these concerns, we propose a noise--frequency Continuation framework that constructs a continuous family of intermediate posteriors whose likelihood enforces measurement consistency only within a noise-dependent frequency band. This principle is instantiated with a stabilized posterior sampler that combines a diffusion predictor, band-limited likelihood guidance, and a multi-resolution consistency strategy that aggressively commits reliable coarse corrections while conservatively adopting high-frequency details only when they become identifiable. Across super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves motion deblurring PSNR by up to 5 dB over strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00181v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding camera dynamics is a fundamental pillar of video spatial intelligence. However, existing multimodal models predominantly treat this task as a black-box classification, often confusing physically distinct motions by relying on superficial visual patterns rather than geometric cues. We present CamReasoner, a framework that reformulates camera movement understanding as a structured inference process to bridge the gap between perception and cinematic logic. Our approach centers on the Observation-Thinking-Answer (O-T-A) paradigm, which compels the model to decode spatio-temporal cues such as trajectories and view frustums within an explicit reasoning block. To instill this capability, we construct a Large-scale Inference Trajectory Suite comprising 18k SFT reasoning chains and 38k RL feedback samples. Notably, we are the first to employ RL for logical alignment in this domain, ensuring motion inferences are grounded in physical geometry rather than contextual guesswork. By applying Reinforcement Learning to the Observation-Think-Answer (O-T-A) reasoning paradigm, CamReasoner effectively suppresses hallucinations and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern deep learning-based inpainting enables realistic local image manipulation, raising critical challenges for reliable detection. However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\% to 55\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) can learn rich visual knowledge from low-cost unlabeled images. However, traditional S4 architectures all face the challenge of low-quality pseudo-labels, especially for the teacher-student framework.We propose a novel SemiEarth model that introduces vision-language models (VLMs) to address the S4 issues for the remote sensing (RS) domain. Specifically, we invent a VLM pseudo-label purifying (VLM-PP) structure to purify the teacher network's pseudo-labels, achieving substantial improvements. Especially in multi-class boundary regions of RS images, the VLM-PP module can significantly improve the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the teacher, thereby correctly guiding the student model's learning. Moreover, since VLM-PP equips VLMs with open-world capabilities and is independent of the S4 architecture, it can correct mispredicted categories in low-confidence pseudo-labels whenever a discrepancy arises between its prediction and the pseudo-label. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple RS datasets, which demonstrate that our SemiEarth achieves SOTA performance. More importantly, unlike previous SOTA RS S4 methods, our model not only achieves excellent performance but also offers good interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/wangshanwen001/SemiEarth.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00211v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised deformable image registration requires aligning complex anatomical structures without reference labels, making interpretability and reliability critical. Existing deep learning methods achieve considerable accuracy but often lack transparency, leading to error drift and reduced clinical trust. We propose a novel Multi-Hop Visual Chain of Reasoning (VCoR) framework that reformulates registration as a progressive reasoning process. Inspired by the iterative nature of clinical decision-making, each visual reasoning hop integrates a Localized Spatial Refinement (LSR) module to enrich feature representations and a Cross-Reference Attention (CRA) mechanism that leads the iterative refinement process, preserving anatomical consistency. This multi-hop strategy enables robust handling of large deformations and produces a transparent sequence of intermediate predictions with a theoretical bound. Beyond accuracy, our framework offers built-in interpretability by estimating uncertainty via the stability and convergence of deformation fields across hops. Extensive evaluations on two challenging public datasets, DIR-Lab 4D CT (lung) and IXI T1-weighted MRI (brain), demonstrate that VCoR achieves competitive registration accuracy while offering rich intermediate visualizations and confidence measures. By embedding an implicit visual reasoning paradigm, we present an interpretable, reliable, and clinically viable unsupervised medical image registration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. Bi-parametric MRI (bp-MRI) and clinical variables are crucial for PCa identification and improving treatment decisions. However, this process is subjective to expert interpretations. Furthermore, most existing computer-aided diagnosis methods focus on imaging-based models, overlooking the clinical context and suffering from data scarcity, limiting their ability to learn robust representations. We propose a geometric multimodal Foundation Model (FM), named MFM-Geom, that learns representations from bp-MRI and clinical reports, encoding visual findings and information from the context of clinical variables. In the representations classification head, the approach leverages symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and Riemannian deep learning to integrate imaging-text representations from a biomedical multimodal FM. Using 10% of the training data, MFM-Geom outperformed baseline class token embedding-based classification (+8.3%, AUC-PR of 90.67). Generalization on external dataset confirmed the robustness of fine-tuning biomedical FM, achieving an AUC-PR of 90.6.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00216v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Smallholder cacao producers often rely on outdated farming techniques and face significant challenges from pests and diseases, unlike larger plantations with more resources and expertise. In the Philippines, cacao farmers have limited access to data, information, and good agricultural practices. This study addresses these issues by developing a mobile application for cacao disease identification and management that functions offline, enabling use in remote areas where farms are mostly located. The core of the system is a deep learning model trained to identify cacao diseases accurately. The trained model is integrated into the mobile app to support farmers in field diagnosis. The disease identification model achieved a validation accuracy of 96.93% while the model for detecting cacao black pod infection levels achieved 79.49% validation accuracy. Field testing of the application showed an agreement rate of 84.2% compared with expert cacao technician assessments. This approach empowers smallholder farmers by providing accessible, technology-enabled tools to improve cacao crop health and productivity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00247v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient inference in Large Vision-Language Models is constrained by the high cost of processing thousands of visual tokens, yet it remains unclear which tokens and computations can be safely removed. While attention scores are commonly used to estimate visual token importance, they are an imperfect proxy for actual contribution. We show that Attention Contribution, which weights attention probabilities by value vector magnitude, provides a more accurate criterion for visual token selection. Our empirical analysis reveals that visual attention sinks are functionally heterogeneous, comprising Probability Dumps with low contribution that can be safely pruned, and Structural Anchors with high contribution essential for maintaining model performance. Further, we identify substantial redundancy in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) associated with visual tokens, particularly in intermediate layers where image tokens exhibit linear behavior. Based on our findings, we introduce CAPA (Contribution-Aware Pruning and FFN Approximation), a dual-strategy framework that prunes visual tokens using attention contribution at critical functional transitions and reduces FFN computation through efficient linear approximations. Experiments on various benchmarks across baselines show that CAPA achieves competent efficiency--performance trade-offs with improved robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid progress of text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked unprecedented creative potential, yet their ability to faithfully render complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships remains a significant bottleneck. Progress is hampered by a lack of adequate evaluation methods; current benchmarks are often restricted to closed-set vocabularies, lack fine-grained diagnostic capabilities, and fail to provide the interpretable feedback necessary to diagnose and remedy specific compositional failures. We solve these challenges by introducing SANEval (Spatial, Attribute, and Numeracy Evaluation), a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a scalable new pipeline for open-vocabulary compositional evaluation. SANEval combines a large language model (LLM) for deep prompt understanding with an LLM-enhanced, open-vocabulary object detector to robustly evaluate compositional adherence, unconstrained by a fixed vocabulary. Through extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art T2I models, we demonstrate that SANEval's automated evaluations provide a more faithful proxy for human assessment; our metric achieves a Spearman's rank correlation with statistically different results than those of existing benchmarks across tasks of attribute binding, spatial relations, and numeracy. To facilitate future research in compositional T2I generation and evaluation, we will release the SANEval dataset and our open-source evaluation pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00262v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Subspace clustering aims to group data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces and finds wide application in computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, and recommendation systems. However, most existing methods assume fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with missing entries. In this paper, we propose a contrastive self-supervised framework, Contrastive Subspace Clustering (CSC), designed for clustering incomplete data. CSC generates masked views of partially observed inputs and trains a deep neural network using a SimCLR-style contrastive loss to learn invariant embeddings. These embeddings are then clustered using sparse subspace clustering. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that CSC consistently outperforms both classical and deep learning baselines, demonstrating strong robustness to missing data and scalability to large datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00265v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Being able to edit panoramic images is crucial for creating realistic 360{\deg} visual experiences. However, existing perspective-based image editing methods fail to model the spatial structure of panoramas. Conventional cube-map decompositions attempt to overcome this problem but inevitably break global consistency due to their mismatch with spherical geometry. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate panoramic editing directly in the equirectangular projection (ERP) domain and present World-Shaper, a unified geometry-aware framework that bridges panoramic generation and editing within a single editing-centric design. To overcome the scarcity of paired data, we adopt a generate-then-edit paradigm, where controllable panoramic generation serves as an auxiliary stage to synthesize diverse paired examples for supervised editing learning. To address geometric distortion, we introduce a geometry-aware learning strategy that explicitly enforces position-aware shape supervision and implicitly internalizes panoramic priors through progressive training. Extensive experiments on our new benchmark, PEBench, demonstrate that our method achieves superior geometric consistency, editing fidelity, and text controllability compared to SOTA methods, enabling coherent and flexible 360{\deg} visual world creation with unified editing control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved photorealistic image synthesis, yet they fall short for studio-level multi-object compositing. This task demands simultaneous (i) near-perfect preservation of each item's identity, (ii) precise background and color fidelity, (iii) layout and design elements control, and (iv) complete, appealing displays showcasing all objects. However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image. Extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that PLACID surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-object compositing, achieving superior identity, background, and color preservation, with less omitted objects and visually appealing results.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Auto-regressive video generation enables long video synthesis by iteratively conditioning each new batch of frames on previously generated content. However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00288v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00289v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This document presents an introduction to computer vision, and its relationship to Cognitive Science, from the perspective of Bayes Decision Theory (Berger 1985). Computer vision is a vast and complex field, so this overview has a narrow scope and provides a theoretical lens which captures many key concepts. BDT is rich enough to include two different approaches: (i) the Bayesian viewpoint, which gives a conceptually attractive framework for vision with concepts that resonate with Cognitive Science (Griffiths et al., 2024), and (ii) the Deep Neural Network approach whose successes in the real world have made Computer Vision into a trillion-dollar industry and which is motivated by the hierarchical structure of the visual ventral stream. The BDT framework relates and captures the strengths and weakness of these two approaches and, by discussing the limitations of BDT, points the way to how they can be combined in a richer framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00292v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While sequential reasoning enhances the capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to execute complex multimodal tasks, their reliability in grounding these reasoning chains within actual visual evidence remains insufficiently explored. We introduce LogicGaze, a novel benchmark framework designed to rigorously interrogate whether VLMs can validate sequential causal chains against visual inputs, specifically targeting the pervasive issue of hallucination. Curated from 40,000 video segments from ShareGPT4Video and a subset of Flickr30k imagery, LogicGaze integrates causal sequences with visually contradictory yet linguistically plausible perturbations, compelling models to verify the authenticity of each reasoning step. Our tripartite evaluation protocol - Causal Validation, Grounded Narrative Synthesis, and Perturbation Rejection - exposes significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. LogicGaze advocates for robust, trustworthy multimodal reasoning, with all resources publicly available in an anonymized repository.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The development of machine learning models for CT imaging depends on the availability of large, high-quality, and diverse annotated datasets. Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings. These results suggest that large-scale mining of historical GSPS annotations represents a promising and scalable approach for generating 3D CT segmentation datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The viability of automated driving is heavily dependent on the performance of perception systems to provide real-time accurate and reliable information for robust decision-making and maneuvers. These systems must perform reliably not only under ideal conditions, but also when challenged by natural and adversarial driving factors. Both of these types of interference can lead to perception errors and delays in detection and classification. Hence, it is essential to assess the robustness of the perception systems of automated vehicles (AVs) and explore strategies for making perception more reliable. We approach this problem by evaluating perception performance using predictive sensitivity quantification based on an ensemble of models, capturing model disagreement and inference variability across multiple models, under adverse driving scenarios in both simulated environments and real-world conditions. A notional architecture for assessing perception performance is proposed. A perception assessment criterion is developed based on an AV's stopping distance at a stop sign on varying road surfaces, such as dry and wet asphalt, and vehicle speed. Five state-of-the-art computer vision models are used, including YOLO (v8-v9), DEtection TRansformer (DETR50, DETR101), Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR)in our experiments. Diminished lighting conditions, e.g., resulting from the presence of fog and low sun altitude, have the greatest impact on the performance of the perception models. Additionally, adversarial road conditions such as occlusions of roadway objects increase perception sensitivity and model performance drops when faced with a combination of adversarial road conditions and inclement weather conditions. Also, it is demonstrated that the greater the distance to a roadway object, the greater the impact on perception performance, hence diminished perception robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This manuscript presents a pioneering Synergistic Neural Agents Network (SynerNet) framework designed to mitigate the phenomenon of cross-modal alignment degeneration in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) concepts. Specifically, four specialized computational units - visual perception, linguistic context, nominal embedding, and global coordination - collaboratively rectify modality disparities via a structured message-propagation protocol. The principal contributions encompass a multi-agent latent space nomenclature acquisition framework, a semantic context-interchange algorithm for enhanced few-shot adaptation, and an adaptive dynamic equilibrium mechanism. Empirical evaluations conducted on the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that SynerNet yields substantial performance augmentations in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, exhibiting precision improvements ranging from 1.2% to 5.4% across a diverse array of domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on knowledge-based VQA tasks, recent work attributes RAG failures to insufficient attention towards the retrieved context, proposing to reduce the attention allocated to image tokens. In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline. Notably, MAD-RAG rectifies up to 74.68% of failure cases with negligible computational overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal fusion has emerged as a promising paradigm for disease diagnosis and prognosis, integrating complementary information from heterogeneous data sources such as medical images, clinical records, and radiology reports. However, existing fusion methods process all available modalities through the network, either treating them equally or learning to assign different contribution weights, leaving a fundamental question unaddressed: for a given patient, should certain modalities be used at all? We present AdaFuse, an adaptive multimodal fusion framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn patient-specific modality selection and fusion strategies for lung cancer risk prediction. AdaFuse formulates multimodal fusion as a sequential decision process, where the policy network iteratively decides whether to incorporate an additional modality or proceed to prediction based on the information already acquired. This sequential formulation enables the model to condition each selection on previously observed modalities and terminate early when sufficient information is available, rather than committing to a fixed subset upfront. We evaluate AdaFuse on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaFuse achieves the highest AUC (0.762) compared to the best single-modality baseline (0.732), the best fixed fusion strategy (0.759), and adaptive baselines including DynMM (0.754) and MoE (0.742), while using fewer FLOPs than all triple-modality methods. Our work demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning for personalized multimodal fusion in medical imaging, representing a shift from uniform fusion strategies toward adaptive diagnostic pipelines that learn when to consult additional modalities and when existing information suffices for accurate prediction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00348v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Metal implants in MRI cause severe artifacts that degrade image quality and hinder clinical diagnosis. Traditional approaches address metal artifact reduction (MAR) and accelerated MRI acquisition as separate problems. We propose MASC, a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes metal-aware k-space sampling and artifact correction for accelerated MRI. To enable supervised training, we construct a paired MRI dataset using physics-based simulation, generating k-space data and reconstructions for phantoms with and without metal implants. This paired dataset provides simulated 3D MRI scans with and without metal implants, where each metal-corrupted sample has an exactly matched clean reference, enabling direct supervision for both artifact reduction and acquisition policy learning. We formulate active MRI acquisition as a sequential decision-making problem, where an artifact-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent learns to select k-space phase-encoding lines under a limited acquisition budget. The agent operates on undersampled reconstructions processed through a U-Net-based MAR network, learning patterns that maximize reconstruction quality. We further propose an end-to-end training scheme where the acquisition policy learns to select k-space lines that best support artifact removal while the MAR network simultaneously adapts to the resulting undersampling patterns. Experiments demonstrate that MASC's learned policies outperform conventional sampling strategies, and end-to-end training improves performance compared to using a frozen pre-trained MAR network, validating the benefit of joint optimization. Cross-dataset experiments on FastMRI with physics-based artifact simulation further confirm generalization to realistic clinical MRI data. The code and models of MASC have been made publicly available: https://github.com/hrlblab/masc

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00350v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning is a key defense mechanism for removing unauthorized concepts from text-to-image diffusion models, yet recent evidence shows that latent visual information often persists after unlearning. Existing adversarial approaches for exploiting this leakage are constrained by fundamental limitations: optimization-based methods are computationally expensive due to per-instance iterative search. At the same time, reasoning-based and heuristic techniques lack direct feedback from the target model's latent visual representations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReLAPSe, a policy-based adversarial framework that reformulates concept restoration as a reinforcement learning problem. ReLAPSe trains an agent using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), leveraging the diffusion model's noise prediction loss as a model-intrinsic and verifiable feedback signal. This closed-loop design directly aligns textual prompt manipulation with latent visual residuals, enabling the agent to learn transferable restoration strategies rather than optimizing isolated prompts. By pioneering the shift from per-instance optimization to global policy learning, ReLAPSe achieves efficient, near-real-time recovery of fine-grained identities and styles across multiple state-of-the-art unlearning methods, providing a scalable tool for rigorous red-teaming of unlearned diffusion models. Some experimental evaluations involve sensitive visual concepts, such as nudity. Code is available at https://github.com/gmum/ReLaPSe

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rating the accuracy of captions in describing images is time-consuming and subjective for humans. In contrast, it is often easier for people to compare two captions and decide which one better matches a given image. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework that models such comparative judgments instead of direct ratings. The model can then be applied to rank unseen image-caption pairs in the same way as a regression model trained on direct ratings. Using the VICR dataset, we extract visual features with ResNet-50 and text features with MiniLM, then train both a regression model and a comparative learning model. While the regression model achieves better performance (Pearson's $\rho$: 0.7609 and Spearman's $r_s$: 0.7089), the comparative learning model steadily improves with more data and approaches the regression baseline. In addition, a small-scale human evaluation study comparing absolute rating, pairwise comparison, and same-image comparison shows that comparative annotation yields faster results and has greater agreement among human annotators. These results suggest that comparative learning can effectively model human preferences while significantly reducing the cost of human annotations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object detection is a crucial component in autonomous vehicle systems. It enables the vehicle to perceive and understand its environment by identifying and locating various objects around it. By utilizing advanced imaging and deep learning techniques, autonomous vehicle systems can rapidly and accurately identify objects based on their features. Different deep learning methods vary in their ability to accurately detect and classify objects in autonomous vehicle systems. Selecting the appropriate method significantly impacts system performance, robustness, and efficiency in real-world driving scenarios. While several generic deep learning architectures like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN have been proposed, guidance on their suitability for specific autonomous driving applications is often limited. The choice of method affects detection accuracy, processing speed, environmental robustness, sensor integration, scalability, and edge case handling. This study provides a comprehensive experimental analysis comparing two prominent object detection models: YOLOv5 (a one-stage detector) and Faster R-CNN (a two-stage detector). Their performance is evaluated on a diverse dataset combining real and synthetic images, considering various metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP), recall, and inference speed. The findings reveal that YOLOv5 demonstrates superior performance in terms of mAP, recall, and training efficiency, particularly as dataset size and image resolution increase. However, Faster R-CNN shows advantages in detecting small, distant objects and performs well in challenging lighting conditions. The models' behavior is also analyzed under different confidence thresholds and in various real-world scenarios, providing insights into their applicability for autonomous driving systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel methodology for annotating the brain vasculature using dynamic 4D-CTA head scans. By using multiple time points from dynamic CTA acquisitions, we subtract bone and soft tissue to enhance the visualization of arteries and veins, reducing the effort required to obtain manual annotations of brain vessels. We then train deep learning models on our ground truth annotations by using the same segmentation for multiple phases from the dynamic 4D-CTA collection, effectively enlarging our dataset by 4 to 5 times and inducing robustness to contrast phases. In total, our dataset comprises 110 training images from 25 patients and 165 test images from 14 patients. In comparison with two similarly-sized datasets for CTA-based brain vessel segmentation, a nnUNet model trained on our dataset can achieve significantly better segmentations across all vascular regions, with an average mDC of 0.846 for arteries and 0.957 for veins in the TopBrain dataset. Furthermore, metrics such as average directed Hausdorff distance (adHD) and topology sensitivity (tSens) reflected similar trends: using our dataset resulted in low error margins (aDHD of 0.304 mm for arteries and 0.078 for veins) and high sensitivity (tSens of 0.877 for arteries and 0.974 for veins), indicating excellent accuracy in capturing vessel morphology.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image captioning (IC) refers to the automatic generation of natural language descriptions for images, with applications ranging from social media content generation to assisting individuals with visual impairments. While most research has been focused on English-based models, low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese face significant challenges due to the lack of specialized datasets and models. Several studies create datasets by automatically translating existing ones to mitigate resource scarcity. This work addresses this gap by proposing a cross-native-translated evaluation of Transformer-based vision and language models for Brazilian Portuguese IC. We use a version of Flickr30K comprised of captions manually created by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers and compare it to a version with captions automatically translated from English to Portuguese. The experiments include a cross-context approach, where models trained on one dataset are tested on the other to assess the translation impact. Additionally, we incorporate attention maps for model inference interpretation and use the CLIP-Score metric to evaluate the image-description alignment. Our findings show that Swin-DistilBERTimbau consistently outperforms other models, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets. ViTucano, a Brazilian Portuguese pre-trained VLM, surpasses larger multilingual models (GPT-4o, LLaMa 3.2 Vision) in traditional text-based evaluation metrics, while GPT-4 models achieve the highest CLIP-Score, highlighting improved image-text alignment. Attention analysis reveals systematic biases, including gender misclassification, object enumeration errors, and spatial inconsistencies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00394v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling human aesthetic judgments in visual art presents significant challenges due to individual preference variability and the high cost of obtaining labeled data. To reduce cost of acquiring such labels, we propose to apply a comparative learning framework based on pairwise preference assessments rather than direct ratings. This approach leverages the Law of Comparative Judgment, which posits that relative choices exhibit less cognitive burden and greater cognitive consistency than direct scoring. We extract deep convolutional features from painting images using ResNet-50 and develop both a deep neural network regression model and a dual-branch pairwise comparison model. We explored four research questions: (RQ1) How does the proposed deep neural network regression model with CNN features compare to the baseline linear regression model using hand-crafted features? (RQ2) How does pairwise comparative learning compare to regression-based prediction when lacking access to direct rating values? (RQ3) Can we predict individual rater preferences through within-rater and cross-rater analysis? (RQ4) What is the annotation cost trade-off between direct ratings and comparative judgments in terms of human time and effort? Our results show that the deep regression model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving up to $328\%$ improvement in $R^2$. The comparative model approaches regression performance despite having no access to direct rating values, validating the practical utility of pairwise comparisons. However, predicting individual preferences remains challenging, with both within-rater and cross-rater performance significantly lower than average rating prediction. Human subject experiments reveal that comparative judgments require $60\%$ less annotation time per item, demonstrating superior annotation efficiency for large-scale preference modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00395v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose 3DGS$^2$-TR,a second-order optimizer for accelerating the scene training problem in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing second-order approaches that rely on explicit or dense curvature representations, such as 3DGS-LM (H\"ollein et al., 2025) or 3DGS2 (Lan et al., 2025), our method approximates curvature using only the diagonal of the Hessian matrix, efficiently via Hutchinson's method. Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00414v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Laboratories are prone to severe injuries from minor unsafe actions, yet continuous safety monitoring -- beyond mandatory pre-lab safety training -- is limited by human availability. Vision language models (VLMs) offer promise for autonomous laboratory safety monitoring, but their effectiveness in realistic settings is unclear due to the lack of visual evaluation data, as most safety incidents are documented primarily as unstructured text. To address this gap, we first introduce a structured data generation pipeline that converts textual laboratory scenarios into aligned triples of (image, scene graph, ground truth), using large language models as scene graph architects and image generation models as renderers. Our experiments on the synthetic dataset of 1,207 samples across 362 unique scenarios and seven open- and closed-source models show that VLMs perform effectively given textual scene graph, but degrade substantially in visual-only settings indicating difficulty in extracting structured object relationships directly from pixels. To overcome this, we propose a post-training context-engineering approach, scene-graph-guided alignment, to bridge perceptual gaps in VLMs by translating visual inputs into structured scene graphs better aligned with VLM reasoning, improving hazard detection performance in visual only settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00420v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly equipped with robust safety safeguards to prevent responses to harmful or disallowed prompts. However, these defenses often focus on analyzing explicit textual inputs or relevant visual scenes. In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries. Overall, our findings expose a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' OCR capabilities that are not robust to dispersed, multi-image adversarial inputs, highlighting the need for defenses for fragmented multimodal inputs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00440v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present DISK, a training-free adaptive inference method for autoregressive world models. DISK coordinates two coupled diffusion transformers for video and ego-trajectory via dual-branch controllers with cross-modal skip decisions, preserving motion-appearance consistency without retraining. We extend higher-order latent-difference skip testing to the autoregressive chain-of-forward regime and propagate controller statistics through rollout loops for long-horizon stability. When integrated into closed-loop driving rollouts on 1500 NuPlan and NuScenes samples using an NVIDIA L40S GPU, DISK achieves 2x speedup on trajectory diffusion and 1.6x speedup on video diffusion while maintaining L2 planning error, visual quality (FID/FVD), and NAVSIM PDMS scores, demonstrating practical long-horizon video-and-trajectory prediction at substantially reduced cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00450v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Outside-in multi-camera perception is increasingly important in indoor environments, where networks of static cameras must support multi-target tracking under occlusion and heterogeneous viewpoints. We evaluate Sparse4D, a query-based spatiotemporal 3D detection and tracking framework that fuses multi-view features in a shared world frame and propagates sparse object queries via instance memory. We study reduced input frame rates, post-training quantization (INT8 and FP8), transfer to the WILDTRACK benchmark, and Transformer Engine mixed-precision fine-tuning. To better capture identity stability, we report Average Track Duration (AvgTrackDur), which measures identity persistence in seconds. Sparse4D remains stable under moderate FPS reductions, but below 2 FPS, identity association collapses even when detections are stable. Selective quantization of the backbone and neck offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off, while attention-related modules are consistently sensitive to low precision. On WILDTRACK, low-FPS pretraining yields large zero-shot gains over the base checkpoint, while small-scale fine-tuning provides limited additional benefit. Transformer Engine mixed precision reduces latency and improves camera scalability, but can destabilize identity propagation, motivating stability-aware validation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transforming a large language model (LLM) into a Vision-Language Model (VLM) can be achieved by mapping the visual tokens from a vision encoder into the embedding space of an LLM. Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens. With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens. More broadly, our findings contribute new evidence on the alignment between vision and language representations, opening up new directions for analyzing latent representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00463v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating realistic 3D scenes from text is crucial for immersive applications like VR, AR, and gaming. While text-driven approaches promise efficiency, existing methods suffer from limited 3D-text data and inconsistent multi-view stitching, resulting in overly simplistic scenes. To address this, we propose PSGS, a two-stage framework for high-fidelity panoramic scene generation. First, a novel two-layer optimization architecture generates semantically coherent panoramas: a layout reasoning layer parses text into structured spatial relationships, while a self-optimization layer refines visual details via iterative MLLM feedback. Second, our panorama sliding mechanism initializes globally consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting point clouds by strategically sampling overlapping perspectives. By incorporating depth and semantic coherence losses during training, we greatly improve the quality and detail fidelity of rendered scenes. Our experiments demonstrate that PSGS outperforms existing methods in panorama generation and produces more appealing 3D scenes, offering a robust solution for scalable immersive content creation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00470v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Individual tree crown segmentation is an important task in remote sensing for forest biomass estimation and ecological monitoring. However, accurate delineation in dense, overlapping canopies remains a bottleneck. While supervised deep learning methods suffer from high annotation costs and limited generalization, emerging foundation models (e.g., Segment Anything Model) often lack domain knowledge, leading to under-segmentation in dense clusters. To bridge this gap, we propose ZS-TreeSeg, a Zero-Shot framework that adapts from two mature tasks: 1) Canopy Semantic segmentation; and 2) Cells instance segmentation. By modeling tree crowns as star-convex objects within a topological flow field using Cellpose-SAM, the ZS-TreeSeg framework forces the mathematical separation of touching tree crown instances based on vector convergence. Experiments on the NEON and BAMFOREST datasets and visual inspection demonstrate that our framework generalizes robustly across diverse sensor types and canopy densities, which can offer a training-free solution for tree crown instance segmentation and labels generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00484v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in sports is highly challenging due to irregular player motion, uniform appearances, and frequent occlusions. These difficulties are further exacerbated by the geometric distortion and extreme scale variation introduced by static fisheye cameras. In this work, we present GTATrack, a hierarchical tracking framework that win first place in the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. GTATrack integrates two core components: Deep Expansion IoU (Deep-EIoU) for motion-agnostic online association and Global Tracklet Association (GTA) for trajectory-level refinement. This two-stage design enables both robust short-term matching and long-term identity consistency. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is used to boost detector recall on small and distorted targets. The synergy between local association and global reasoning effectively addresses identity switches, occlusions, and tracking fragmentation. Our method achieved a winning HOTA score of 0.60 and significantly reduced false positives to 982, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy in fisheye-based soccer tracking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00489v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sketch edit at stroke-level aims to transplant source strokes onto a target sketch via stroke expansion or replacement, while preserving semantic consistency and visual fidelity with the target sketch. Recent studies addressed it by relocating source strokes at appropriate canvas positions. However, as source strokes could exhibit significant variations in both size and orientation, we may fail to produce plausible sketch editing results by merely repositioning them without further adjustments. For example, anchoring an oversized source stroke onto the target without proper scaling would fail to produce a semantically coherent outcome. In this paper, we propose SketchMod to refine the source stroke through transformation so as to align it with the target sketch's patterns, further realize flexible sketch edit at stroke-level. As the source stroke refinement is governed by the patterns of the target sketch, we learn three key offset attributes (scale, orientation and position) from the source stroke to another, and align it with the target by: 1) resizing to match spatial proportions by scale, 2) rotating to align with local geometry by orientation, and 3) displacing to meet with semantic layout by position. Besides, a stroke's profiles can be precisely controlled during sketch edit via the exposed captured stroke attributes. Experimental results indicate that SketchMod achieves precise and flexible performances on stroke-level sketch edit.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00490v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion aims to reconstruct a high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI) by combining the rich spectral information of a low-resolution HSI (LR-HSI) with the fine spatial details of a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI). Although recent deep learning methods have achieved notable progress, they still suffer from limited receptive fields, redundant spectral bands, and the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which restrict both efficiency and robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Dense Correlation Network (HSSDCT). The framework introduces two key modules: (i) a Hierarchical Dense-Residue Transformer Block (HDRTB) that progressively enlarges windows and employs dense-residue connections for multi-scale feature aggregation, and (ii) a Spatial-Spectral Correlation Layer (SSCL) that explicitly factorizes spatial and spectral dependencies, reducing self-attention to linear complexity while mitigating spectral redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSSDCT delivers superior reconstruction quality with significantly lower computational costs, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in HSI fusion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) are primarily pre-trained on the RGB modality, thereby limiting their performance on other modalities, such as infrared, depth, and event data, which are crucial for complex scenarios. To address this, we propose RGBX-R1, a framework to enhance MLLM's perception and reasoning capacities across various X visual modalities. Specifically, we employ an Understand-Associate-Validate (UAV) prompting strategy to construct the Visual Modality Chain-of-Thought (VM-CoT), which aims to expand the MLLMs' RGB understanding capability into X modalities. To progressively enhance reasoning capabilities, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm: Cold-Start Supervised Fine-Tuning (CS-SFT) and Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (ST-RFT). CS-SFT supervises the reasoning process with the guidance of VM-CoT, equipping the MLLM with fundamental modality cognition. Building upon GRPO, ST-RFT employs a Modality-understanding Spatio-Temporal (MuST) reward to reinforce modality reasoning. Notably, we construct the first RGBX-Grounding benchmark, and extensive experiments verify our superiority in multimodal understanding and spatial perception, outperforming baselines by 22.71% on three RGBX grounding tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00505v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and generation, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in their ability to process data across multiple modalities. While most existing efforts focus on scaling up language models or constructing higher-quality training data, limited attention has been paid to effectively integrating cross-modal knowledge into the language space. In vision-language models, for instance, aligning modalities using only high-level visual features often discards the rich semantic information present in mid- and low-level features, limiting the model's ability of cross-modality understanding. To address this issue, we propose SparseCut, a general cross-modal fusion architecture for MLLMs, introducing sparse shortcut connections between the cross-modal encoder and the LLM. These shortcut connections enable the efficient and hierarchical integration of visual features at multiple levels, facilitating richer semantic fusion without increasing computational overhead. We further introduce an efficient multi-grained feature fusion module, which performs the fusion of visual features before routing them through the shortcuts. This preserves the original language context and does not increase the overall input length, thereby avoiding an increase in computational complexity for the LLM. Experiments demonstrate that SparseCut significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs across various multimodal benchmarks with generality and scalability for different base LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00508v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interleaved multimodal generation enables capabilities beyond unimodal generation models, such as step-by-step instructional guides, visual planning, and generating visual drafts for reasoning. However, the quality of existing interleaved generation models under general instructions remains limited by insufficient training data and base model capacity. We present DuoGen, a general-purpose interleaved generation framework that systematically addresses data curation, architecture design, and evaluation. On the data side, we build a large-scale, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset by combining multimodal conversations rewritten from curated raw websites, and diverse synthetic examples covering everyday scenarios. Architecturally, DuoGen leverages the strong visual understanding of a pretrained multimodal LLM and the visual generation capabilities of a diffusion transformer (DiT) pretrained on video generation, avoiding costly unimodal pretraining and enabling flexible base model selection. A two-stage decoupled strategy first instruction-tunes the MLLM, then aligns DiT with it using curated interleaved image-text sequences. Across public and newly proposed benchmarks, DuoGen outperforms prior open-source models in text quality, image fidelity, and image-context alignment, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-to-image and image editing among unified generation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00516v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We argue that existing training-free segmentation methods rely on an implicit and limiting assumption, that segmentation is a spectral graph partitioning problem over diffusion-derived affinities. Such approaches, based on global graph partitioning and eigenvector-based formulations of affinity matrices, suffer from several fundamental drawbacks, they require pre-selecting the number of clusters, induce boundary oversmoothing due to spectral relaxation, and remain highly sensitive to noisy or multi-modal affinity distributions. Moreover, many prior works neglect the importance of local neighborhood structure, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing affinity propagation and preserving fine-grained contours. To address these limitations, we reformulate training-free segmentation as a stochastic flow equilibrium problem over diffusion-induced affinity graphs, where segmentation emerges from a stochastic propagation process that integrates global diffusion attention with local neighborhoods extracted from stable diffusion, yielding a sparse yet expressive affinity structure. Building on this formulation, we introduce a Markov propagation scheme that performs random-walk-based label diffusion with an adaptive pruning strategy that suppresses unreliable transitions while reinforcing confident affinity paths. Experiments across seven widely used semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, producing sharper boundaries, more coherent regions, and significantly more stable masks compared to prior spectral-clustering-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00522v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) often leverages pretrained vision or vision-language models, but many existing methods use prompt learning or complex modeling to fit the data distribution, resulting in high training or inference cost and limited cross-domain stability. To address these limitations, we propose Memory-Retrieval Anomaly Detection method (MRAD), a unified framework that replaces parametric fitting with a direct memory retrieval. The train-free base model, MRAD-TF, freezes the CLIP image encoder and constructs a two-level memory bank (image-level and pixel-level) from auxiliary data, where feature-label pairs are explicitly stored as keys and values. During inference, anomaly scores are obtained directly by similarity retrieval over the memory bank. Based on the MRAD-TF, we further propose two lightweight variants as enhancements: (i) MRAD-FT fine-tunes the retrieval metric with two linear layers to enhance the discriminability between normal and anomaly; (ii) MRAD-CLIP injects the normal and anomalous region priors from the MRAD-FT as dynamic biases into CLIP's learnable text prompts, strengthening generalization to unseen categories. Across 16 industrial and medical datasets, the MRAD framework consistently demonstrates superior performance in anomaly classification and segmentation, under both train-free and training-based settings. Our work shows that fully leveraging the empirical distribution of raw data, rather than relying only on model fitting, can achieve stronger anomaly detection performance. The code will be publicly released at https://github.com/CROVO1026/MRAD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00523v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate inference in vision-language models (VLMs) by enabling parallel verification of multiple draft tokens. However, existing methods rely on static tree structures that remain fixed throughout the decoding process, failing to adapt to the varying prediction difficulty across generation steps. This leads to suboptimal acceptance lengths and limited speedup. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the speculation tree structure based on real-time prediction uncertainty. Our key insight is that output entropy serves as a natural confidence indicator with strong temporal correlation across decoding steps. SAGE constructs deeper-narrower trees for high-confidence predictions to maximize speculation depth, and shallower-wider trees for uncertain predictions to diversify exploration. SAGE improves acceptance lengths and achieves faster acceleration compared to static tree baselines. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SAGE: without any loss in output quality, it delivers up to $3.36\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and $3.18\times$ for Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional object detection systems are typically constrained to predefined categories, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments. In contrast, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables the identification of objects from novel classes not present in the training set. Recent advances in visual-language modeling have led to significant progress of OVD. However, prior works face challenges in either adapting the single-scale image backbone from CLIP to the detection framework or ensuring robust visual-language alignment. We propose Visual-Language Detection (VLDet), a novel framework that revamps feature pyramid for fine-grained visual-language alignment, leading to improved OVD performance. With the VL-PUB module, VLDet effectively exploits the visual-language knowledge from CLIP and adapts the backbone for object detection through feature pyramid. In addition, we introduce the SigRPN block, which incorporates a sigmoid-based anchor-text contrastive alignment loss to improve detection of novel categories. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves 58.7 AP for novel classes on COCO2017 and 24.8 AP on LVIS, surpassing all state-of-the-art methods and achieving significant improvements of 27.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Furthermore, VLDet also demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on closed-set object detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cloud contamination severely degrades the usability of remote sensing imagery and poses a fundamental challenge for downstream Earth observation tasks. Recently, diffusion-based models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for remote sensing cloud removal due to their strong generative capability and stable optimization. However, existing diffusion-based approaches often suffer from limited sampling efficiency and insufficient exploitation of structural and temporal priors in multi-temporal remote sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose SADER, a structure-aware diffusion framework for multi-temporal remote sensing cloud removal. SADER first develops a scalable Multi-Temporal Conditional Diffusion Network (MTCDN) to fully capture multi-temporal and multimodal correlations via temporal fusion and hybrid attention. Then, a cloud-aware attention loss is introduced to emphasize cloud-dominated regions by accounting for cloud thickness and brightness discrepancies. In addition, a deterministic resampling strategy is designed for continuous diffusion models to iteratively refine samples under fixed sampling steps by replacing outliers through guided correction. Extensive experiments on multiple multi-temporal datasets demonstrate that SADER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cloud removal methods across all evaluation metrics. The code of SADER is publicly available at https://github.com/zyfzs0/SADER.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00542v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present NPNet, a fully non-parametric approach for 3D point-cloud classification and part segmentation. NPNet contains no learned weights; instead, it builds point features using deterministic operators such as farthest point sampling, k-nearest neighbors, and pooling. Our key idea is an adaptive Gaussian-Fourier positional encoding whose bandwidth and Gaussian-cosine mixing are chosen from the input geometry, helping the method remain stable across different scales and sampling densities. For segmentation, we additionally incorporate fixed-frequency Fourier features to provide global context alongside the adaptive encoding. Across ModelNet40/ModelNet-R, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, NPNet achieves strong performance among non-parametric baselines, and it is particularly effective in few-shot settings on ModelNet40. NPNet also offers favorable memory use and inference time compared to prior non-parametric methods

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current research on video hallucination mitigation primarily focuses on isolated error types, leaving compositional hallucinations, arising from incorrect reasoning over multiple interacting spatial and temporal factors largely underexplored. We introduce OmniVCHall, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate both isolated and compositional hallucinations in video multimodal large language models (VLLMs). OmniVCHall spans diverse video domains, introduces a novel camera-based hallucination type, and defines a fine-grained taxonomy, together with adversarial answer options (e.g., "All are correct" and "None of the above") to prevent shortcut reasoning. The evaluations of 39 representative VLLMs reveal that even advanced models (e.g., Qwen3-VL and GPT-5) exhibit substantial performance degradation. We propose TriCD, a contrastive decoding framework with a triple-pathway calibration mechanism. An adaptive perturbation controller dynamically selects distracting operations to construct negative video variants, while a saliency-guided enhancement module adaptively reinforces grounded token-wise visual evidences. These components are optimized via reinforcement learning to encourage precise decision-making under compositional hallucination settings. Experimental results show that TriCD consistently improves performance across two representative backbones, achieving an average accuracy improvement of over 10%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language tracking has gained increasing attention in many scenarios. This task simultaneously deals with visual and linguistic information to localize objects in videos. Despite its growing utility, the development of vision-language tracking methods remains in its early stage. Current vision-language trackers usually employ Transformer architectures for interactive integration of template, search, and text features. However, persistent challenges about low-semantic images including prevalent image blurriness, low resolution and so on, may compromise model performance through degraded cross-modal understanding. To solve this problem, language assistance is usually used to deal with the obstacles posed by low-semantic images. However, due to the existing gap between current textual and visual features, direct concatenation and fusion of these features may have limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering Generative Language-AssisteD tracking model, GLAD, which utilizes diffusion models for the generative multi-modal fusion of text description and template image to bolster compatibility between language and image and enhance template image semantic information. Our approach demonstrates notable improvements over the existing fusion paradigms. Blurry and semantically ambiguous template images can be restored to improve multi-modal features in the generative fusion paradigm. Experiments show that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks and achieves an impressive inference speed.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00579v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Universal image restoration is a critical task in low-level vision, requiring the model to remove various degradations from low-quality images to produce clean images with rich detail. The challenges lie in sampling the distribution of high-quality images and adjusting the outputs on the basis of the degradation. This paper presents a novel approach, Bridging Degradation discrimination and Generation (BDG), which aims to address these challenges concurrently. First, we propose the Multi-Angle and multi-Scale Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (MAS-GLCM) and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing fine-grained discrimination of degradation types and levels. Subsequently, we divide the diffusion training process into three distinct stages: generation, bridging, and restoration. The objective is to preserve the diffusion model's capability of restoring rich textures while simultaneously integrating the discriminative information from the MAS-GLCM into the restoration process. This enhances its proficiency in addressing multi-task and multi-degraded scenarios. Without changing the architecture, BDG achieves significant performance gains in all-in-one restoration and real-world super-resolution tasks, primarily evidenced by substantial improvements in fidelity without compromising perceptual quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00583v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The lack of large-scale, demographically diverse face images with precise Action Unit (AU) occurrence and intensity annotations has long been recognized as a fundamental bottleneck in developing generalizable AU recognition systems. In this paper, we propose MAUGen, a diffusion-based multi-modal framework that jointly generates a large collection of photorealistic facial expressions and anatomically consistent AU labels, including both occurrence and intensity, conditioned on a single descriptive text prompt. Our MAUGen involves two key modules: (1) a Multi-modal Representation Learning (MRL) module that captures the relationships among the paired textual description, facial identity, expression image, and AU activations within a unified latent space; and (2) a Diffusion-based Image label Generator (DIG) that decodes the joint representation into aligned facial image-label pairs across diverse identities. Under this framework, we introduce Multi-Identity Facial Action (MIFA), a large-scale multimodal synthetic dataset featuring comprehensive AU annotations and identity variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAUGen outperforms existing methods in synthesizing photorealistic, demographically diverse facial images along with semantically aligned AU labels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00593v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite progress on general tasks, VLMs struggle with challenges demanding both detailed visual grounding and deliberate knowledge-based reasoning, a synergy not captured by existing benchmarks that evaluate these skills separately. To close this gap, we introduce Pix2Fact, a new visual question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level perception and knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning. Pix2Fact contains 1,000 high-resolution (4K+) images spanning 8 daily-life scenarios and situations, with questions and answers meticulously crafted by annotators holding PhDs from top global universities working in partnership with a professional data annotation firm. Each question requires detailed visual grounding, multi-hop reasoning, and the integration of external knowledge to answer. Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs, including proprietary models like Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5, reveals the substantial challenge posed by Pix2Fact: the most advanced model achieves only 24.0% average accuracy, in stark contrast to human performance of 56%. This significant gap underscores the limitations of current models in replicating human-level visual comprehension. We believe Pix2Fact will serve as a critical benchmark to drive the development of next-generation multimodal agents that combine fine-grained perception with robust, knowledge-based reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D style transfer refers to the artistic stylization of 3D assets based on reference style images. Recently, 3DGS-based stylization methods have drawn considerable attention, primarily due to their markedly enhanced training and rendering speeds. However, a vital challenge for 3D style transfer is to strike a balance between the content and the patterns and colors of the style. Although the existing methods strive to achieve relatively balanced outcomes, the fixed-output paradigm struggles to adapt to the diverse content-style balance requirements from different users. In this work, we introduce a creative intensity-tunable 3D style transfer paradigm, dubbed \textbf{Tune-Your-Style}, which allows users to flexibly adjust the style intensity injected into the scene to match their desired content-style balance, thus enhancing the customizability of 3D style transfer. To achieve this goal, we first introduce Gaussian neurons to explicitly model the style intensity and parameterize a learnable style tuner to achieve intensity-tunable style injection. To facilitate the learning of tunable stylization, we further propose the tunable stylization guidance, which obtains multi-view consistent stylized views from diffusion models through cross-view style alignment, and then employs a two-stage optimization strategy to provide stable and efficient guidance by modulating the balance between full-style guidance from the stylized views and zero-style guidance from the initial rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only delivers visually appealing results, but also exhibits flexible customizability for 3D style transfer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00621v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LVLMs achieve remarkable multimodal understanding and generation but remain susceptible to hallucinations. Existing mitigation methods predominantly focus on output-level adjustments, leaving the internal mechanisms that give rise to these hallucinations largely unexplored. To gain a deeper understanding, we adopt a representation-level perspective by introducing sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose dense visual embeddings into sparse, interpretable neurons. Through neuron-level analysis, we identify distinct neuron types, including always-on neurons and image-specific neurons. Our findings reveal that hallucinations often result from disruptions or spurious activations of image-specific neurons, while always-on neurons remain largely stable. Moreover, selectively enhancing or suppressing image-specific neurons enables controllable intervention in LVLM outputs, improving visual grounding and reducing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Neuron Steering (CNS), which identifies image-specific neurons via contrastive analysis between clean and noisy inputs. CNS selectively amplifies informative neurons while suppressing perturbation-induced activations, producing more robust and semantically grounded visual representations. This not only enhances visual understanding but also effectively mitigates hallucinations. By operating at the prefilling stage, CNS is fully compatible with existing decoding-stage methods. Extensive experiments on both hallucination-focused and general multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CNS consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving overall multimodal understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00627v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Benefiting from the significant advancements in text-to-image diffusion models, research in personalized image generation, particularly customized portrait generation, has also made great strides recently. However, existing methods either require time-consuming fine-tuning and lack generalizability or fail to achieve high fidelity in facial details. To address these issues, we propose FaceSnap, a novel method based on Stable Diffusion (SD) that requires only a single reference image and produces extremely consistent results in a single inference stage. This method is plug-and-play and can be easily extended to different SD models. Specifically, we design a new Facial Attribute Mixer that can extract comprehensive fused information from both low-level specific features and high-level abstract features, providing better guidance for image generation. We also introduce a Landmark Predictor that maintains reference identity across landmarks with different poses, providing diverse yet detailed spatial control conditions for image generation. Then we use an ID-preserving module to inject these into the UNet. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs remarkably in personalized and customized portrait generation, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods in this domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00635v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing face parsing methods usually misclassify occlusions as facial components. This is because occlusion is a high-level concept, it does not refer to a concrete category of object. Thus, constructing a real-world face dataset covering all categories of occlusion object is almost impossible and accurate mask annotation is labor-intensive. To deal with the problems, we present S$^3$POT, a contrast-driven framework synergizing face generation with self-supervised spatial prompting, to achieve occlusion segmentation. The framework is inspired by the insights: 1) Modern face generators' ability to realistically reconstruct occluded regions, creating an image that preserve facial geometry while eliminating occlusion, and 2) Foundation segmentation models' (e.g., SAM) capacity to extract precise mask when provided with appropriate prompts. In particular, S$^3$POT consists of three modules: Reference Generation (RF), Feature enhancement (FE), and Prompt Selection (PS). First, a reference image is produced by RF using structural guidance from parsed mask. Second, FE performs contrast of tokens between raw and reference images to obtain an initial prompt, then modifies image features with the prompt by cross-attention. Third, based on the enhanced features, PS constructs a set of positive and negative prompts and screens them with a self-attention network for a mask decoder. The network is learned under the guidance of three novel and complementary objective functions without occlusion ground truth mask involved. Extensive experiments on a dedicatedly collected dataset demonstrate S$^3$POT's superior performance and the effectiveness of each module.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scene understanding and reasoning has been a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision, requiring models to identify objects, their properties, and spatial or comparative relationships among the objects. Existing approaches enable this by creating scene graphs using multiple inputs such as 2D images, depth maps, object labels, and annotated relationships from specific reference view. However, these methods often struggle with generalization and produce inaccurate spatial relationships like "left/right", which become inconsistent across different viewpoints. To address these limitations, we propose Viewpoint-Invariant Zero-shot scene graph generation for 3D scene Reasoning (VIZOR). VIZOR is a training-free, end-to-end framework that constructs dense, viewpoint-invariant 3D scene graphs directly from raw 3D scenes. The generated scene graph is unambiguous, as spatial relationships are defined relative to each object's front-facing direction, making them consistent regardless of the reference view. Furthermore, it infers open-vocabulary relationships that describe spatial and proximity relationships among scene objects without requiring annotated training data. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations to assess the effectiveness of VIZOR in scene graph generation and downstream tasks, such as query-based object grounding. VIZOR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing clear improvements in scene graph generation and achieving 22% and 4.81% gains in zero-shot grounding accuracy on the Replica and Nr3D datasets, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00639v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Portrait customization (PC) has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential applications. However, existing PC methods lack precise identity (ID) preservation and face control. To address these tissues, we propose Diff-PC, a diffusion-based framework for zero-shot PC, which generates realistic portraits with high ID fidelity, specified facial attributes, and diverse backgrounds. Specifically, our approach employs the 3D face predictor to reconstruct the 3D-aware facial priors encompassing the reference ID, target expressions, and poses. To capture fine-grained face details, we design ID-Encoder that fuses local and global facial features. Subsequently, we devise ID-Ctrl using the 3D face to guide the alignment of ID features. We further introduce ID-Injector to enhance ID fidelity and facial controllability. Finally, training on our collected ID-centric dataset improves face similarity and text-to-image (T2I) alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-PC surpasses state-of-the-art methods in ID preservation, facial control, and T2I consistency. Furthermore, our method is compatible with multi-style foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00650v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images such as MRI and CT is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide powerful general-purpose representations but struggle in medical imaging due to domain shift, their inherently 2D design, and the high computational cost of fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-SAM, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that combines a frozen SAM encoder with the linear-time efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities of Mamba-based State Space Models (SSMs). We investigate two parameter-efficient adaptation strategies. The first is a dual-branch architecture that explicitly fuses general features from a frozen SAM encoder with domain-specific representations learned by a trainable VMamba encoder using cross-attention. The second is an adapter-based approach that injects lightweight, 3D-aware Tri-Plane Mamba (TPMamba) modules into the frozen SAM ViT encoder to implicitly model volumetric context. Within this framework, we introduce Multi-Frequency Gated Convolution (MFGC), which enhances feature representation by jointly analyzing spatial and frequency-domain information via 3D discrete cosine transforms and adaptive gating. Extensive experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The dual-branch Mamba-SAM-Base model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.906, comparable to UNet++ (0.907), while outperforming all baselines on Myocardium (0.910) and Left Ventricle (0.971) segmentation. The adapter-based TP MFGC variant offers superior inference speed (4.77 FPS) with strong accuracy (0.880 Dice). These results show that hybridizing foundation models with efficient SSM-based architectures provides a practical and effective solution for 3D medical image segmentation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models have transformed multimodal representation learning, yet dominant contrastive approaches like CLIP require large batch sizes, careful negative sampling, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce NOVA, a NOn-contrastive Vision-language Alignment framework based on joint embedding prediction with distributional regularization. NOVA aligns visual representations to a frozen, domain-specific text encoder by predicting text embeddings from augmented image views, while enforcing an isotropic Gaussian structure via Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg). This eliminates the need for negative sampling, momentum encoders, or stop-gradients, reducing the training objective to a single hyperparameter. We evaluate NOVA on zeroshot chest X-ray classification using ClinicalBERT as the text encoder and Vision Transformers trained from scratch on MIMIC-CXR. On zero-shot classification across three benchmark datasets, NOVA outperforms multiple standard baselines while exhibiting substantially more consistent training runs. Our results demonstrate that non-contrastive vision-language pretraining offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to contrastive methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting of complex three-dimensional phenomena (4D: 3D + time) is fundamental to applications in medical imaging, fluid and material dynamics, and geophysics. In contrast to unconstrained neural forecasting models, we propose a Schr\"odinger-inspired, physics-guided neural architecture that embeds an explicit time-evolution operator within a deep convolutional framework for 4D prediction. From observed volumetric sequences, the model learns voxelwise amplitude, phase, and potential fields that define a complex-valued wavefunction $\psi = A e^{i\phi}$, which is evolved forward in time using a differentiable, unrolled Schr\"odinger time stepper. This physics-guided formulation yields several key advantages: (i) temporal stability arising from the structured evolution operator, which mitigates drift and error accumulation in long-horizon forecasting; (ii) an interpretable latent representation, where phase encodes transport dynamics, amplitude captures structural intensity, and the learned potential governs spatiotemporal interactions; and (iii) natural compatibility with deformation-based synthesis, which is critical for preserving anatomical fidelity in medical imaging applications. By integrating physical priors directly into the learning process, the proposed approach combines the expressivity of deep networks with the robustness and interpretability of physics-based modeling. We demonstrate accurate and stable prediction of future 4D states, including volumetric intensities and deformation fields, on synthetic benchmarks that emulate realistic shape deformations and topological changes. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end 4D neural forecasting framework to incorporate a Schr\"odinger-type evolution operator, offering a principled pathway toward interpretable, stable, and anatomically consistent spatiotemporal prediction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00669v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neuropathological analyses benefit from spatially precise volumetric reconstructions that enhance anatomical delineation and improve morphometric accuracy. Our prior work has shown the feasibility of reconstructing 3D brain volumes from 2D dissection photographs. However these outputs sometimes exhibit coarse, overly smooth reconstructions of structures, especially under high anisotropy (i.e., reconstructions from thick slabs). Here, we introduce a computationally efficient super-resolution step that imputes slices to generate anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, we ensure that our method generalizes across dissection protocols and remains robust to large slab thicknesses. The imputed volumes yield improved automated segmentations, achieving higher Dice scores, particularly in cortical and white matter regions. Validation on surface reconstruction and atlas registration tasks demonstrates more accurate cortical surfaces and MRI registration. By enhancing the resolution and anatomical fidelity of photograph-based reconstructions, our approach strengthens the bridge between neuropathology and neuroimaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While dynamic Gaussian Splatting has driven significant advances in free-viewpoint video, maintaining its rendering quality with a small memory footprint for efficient streaming transmission still presents an ongoing challenge. Existing streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression methods typically leverage a latent representation to drive the neural network for predicting Gaussian residuals between frames. Their core latent representations can be categorized into structured grid-based and unstructured point-based paradigms. However, the former incurs significant parameter redundancy by inevitably modeling unoccupied space, while the latter suffers from limited compactness as it fails to exploit local correlations. To relieve these limitations, we propose HPC, a novel streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression framework. It employs a hierarchical point-based latent representation that operates on a per-Gaussian basis to avoid parameter redundancy in unoccupied space. Guided by a tailored aggregation scheme, these latent points achieve high compactness with low spatial redundancy. To improve compression efficiency, we further undertake the first investigation to compress neural networks for streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting through mining and exploiting the inter-frame correlation of parameters. Combined with latent compression, this forms a fully end-to-end compression framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HPC substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It achieves a storage reduction of 67% against its baseline while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00683v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This thesis explores the central question of how to leverage temporal relations among video elements to advance video understanding. Addressing the limitations of existing methods, the work presents a five-fold contribution: (1) an automatic annotation framework that utilizes large vision-language models and a noise-robust contrastive learning objective with a subtractive angular margin; (2) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy using "recurrent adapters" to capture temporal dynamics in low-data regimes; (3) the integration of State Space Layers (SSL) for efficient long-form video modeling, supported by the introduction of two new long-term benchmarks for egocentric and feature-length content; (4) a novel contrastive learning framework designed to explicitly model fine-grained relations between motions and video moments; and (5) a comprehensive empirical study on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that identifies the visual-language interface as a bottleneck for temporal reasoning, leading to a new "temporal-oriented recipe" for upscaled video understanding. Collectively, these contributions demonstrate that explicit temporal modeling significantly enhances a model's ability to represent and reason about the fluid nature of video content.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00687v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collaborative perception improves 3D understanding by fusing multi-agent observations, yet intermediate-feature sharing faces strict bandwidth constraints as dense BEV features saturate V2X links. We observe that collaborators view the same physical world, making their features strongly correlated; thus receivers only need innovation beyond their local context. Revisiting this from a distributed source coding perspective, we propose V2X-DSC, a framework with a Conditional Codec (DCC) for bandwidth-constrained fusion. The sender compresses BEV features into compact codes, while the receiver performs conditional reconstruction using its local features as side information, allocating bits to complementary cues rather than redundant content. This conditional structure regularizes learning, encouraging incremental representation and yielding lower-noise features. Experiments on DAIR-V2X, OPV2V, and V2X-Real demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-bandwidth trade-offs under KB-level communication, and generalizes as a plug-and-play communication layer across multiple fusion backbones.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing video avatar models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in scenarios such as talking, public speaking, and singing. However, the majority of these methods exhibit limited alignment with respect to text instructions, particularly when the prompts involve complex elements including large full-body movement, dynamic camera trajectory, background transitions, or human-object interactions. To break out this limitation, we present JoyAvatar, a framework capable of generating long duration avatar videos, featuring two key technical innovations. Firstly, we introduce a twin-teacher enhanced training algorithm that enables the model to transfer inherent text-controllability from the foundation model while simultaneously learning audio-visual synchronization. Secondly, during training, we dynamically modulate the strength of multi-modal conditions (e.g., audio and text) based on the distinct denoising timestep, aiming to mitigate conflicts between the heterogeneous conditioning signals. These two key designs serve to substantially expand the avatar model's capacity to generate natural, temporally coherent full-body motions and dynamic camera movements as well as preserve the basic avatar capabilities, such as accurate lip-sync and identity consistency. GSB evaluation results demonstrate that our JoyAvatar model outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as Omnihuman-1.5 and KlingAvatar 2.0. Moreover, our approach enables complex applications including multi-person dialogues and non-human subjects role-playing. Some video samples are provided on https://joyavatar.github.io/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00703v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sorghum is a globally important cereal grown widely in water-limited and stress-prone regions. Its strong drought tolerance makes it a priority crop for climate-resilient agriculture. Improving water-use efficiency in sorghum requires precise characterisation of stomatal traits, as stomata control of gas exchange, transpiration and photosynthesis have a major influence on crop performance. Automated analysis of sorghum stomata is difficult because the stomata are small (often less than 40 $\mu$m in length in grasses such as sorghum) and vary in shape across genotypes and leaf surfaces. Automated segmentation contributes to high-throughput stomatal phenotyping, yet current methods still face challenges related to nested small structures and annotation bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised instance segmentation framework tailored for analysis of sorghum stomatal components. We collect and annotate a sorghum leaf imagery dataset containing 11,060 human-annotated patches, covering the three stomatal components (pore, guard cell and complex area) across multiple genotypes and leaf surfaces. To improve the detection of tiny structures, we split high-resolution microscopy images into overlapping small patches. We then apply a pseudo-labelling strategy to unannotated images, producing an additional 56,428 pseudo-labelled patches. Benchmarking across semantic and instance segmentation models shows substantial performance gains: for semantic models the top mIoU increases from 65.93% to 70.35%, whereas for instance models the top AP rises from 28.30% to 46.10%. These results demonstrate that combining patch-based preprocessing with semi-supervised learning significantly improves the segmentation of fine stomatal structures. The proposed framework supports scalable extraction of stomatal traits and facilitates broader adoption of AI-driven phenotyping in crop science.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong progress in generative tasks, offering a more stable alternative to GAN-based approaches for makeup transfer. Existing methods often suffer from limited datasets, poor disentanglement between identity and makeup features, and weak controllability. To address these issues, we make three contributions. First, we construct a curated high-quality dataset using a train-generate-filter-retrain strategy that combines synthetic, realistic, and filtered samples to improve diversity and fidelity. Second, we design a diffusion-based framework that disentangles identity and makeup features, ensuring facial structure and skin tone are preserved while applying accurate and diverse cosmetic styles. Third, we propose a text-guided mechanism that allows fine-grained and region-specific control, enabling users to modify eyes, lips, or face makeup with natural language prompts. Experiments on benchmarks and real-world scenarios demonstrate improvements in fidelity, identity preservation, and flexibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00739v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based algorithm for separating the inter and outer layer surfaces from double-layered point clouds, particularly those exhibiting the "double surface artifact" caused by truncation in Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) fusion during indoor or medical 3D reconstruction. This artifact arises from asymmetric truncation thresholds, leading to erroneous inter and outer shells in the fused volume, which our method addresses by extracting the true inter layer to mitigate challenges like overlapping surfaces and disordered normals. We focus on point clouds with \emph{open boundaries} (i.e., sampled surfaces with topological openings/holes through which particles may escape), rather than point clouds with \emph{missing surface regions} where no samples exist. Our approach enables robust processing of both watertight and open-boundary models, achieving extraction of the inter layer from 20,000 inter and 20,000 outer points in approximately 10 seconds. This solution is particularly effective for applications requiring accurate surface representations, such as indoor scene modeling and medical imaging, where double-layered point clouds are prevalent, and it accommodates both closed (watertight) and open-boundary surface geometries. Our goal is \emph{post-hoc} inter/outer shell separation as a lightweight module after TSDF fusion; we do not aim to replace full variational or learning-based reconstruction pipelines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) capture richer spatial-spectral information beyond RGB, yet real-world HSIs often suffer from a composite mix of degradations, such as noise, blur, and missing bands. Existing generative approaches for HSI restoration like diffusion models require hundreds of iterative steps, making them computationally impractical for high-dimensional HSIs. While regression models tend to produce oversmoothed results, failing to preserve critical structural details. We break this impasse by introducing HSI-VAR, rethinking HSI restoration as an autoregressive generation problem, where spectral and spatial dependencies can be progressively modeled rather than globally reconstructed. HSI-VAR incorporates three key innovations: (1) Latent-condition alignment, which couples semantic consistency between latent priors and conditional embeddings for precise reconstruction; (2) Degradation-aware guidance, which uniquely encodes mixed degradations as linear combinations in the embedding space for automatic control, remarkably achieving a nearly $50\%$ reduction in computational cost at inference; (3) A spatial-spectral adaptation module that refines details across both domains in the decoding phase. Extensive experiments on nine all-in-one HSI restoration benchmarks confirm HSI-VAR's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 3.77 dB PSNR improvement on \textbf{\textit{ICVL}} and offering superior structure preservation with an inference speed-up of up to $95.5 \times$ compared with diffusion-based methods, making it a highly practical solution for real-world HSI restoration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate nerve localization is critical for the success of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, yet manual identification remains challenging due to low image contrast, speckle noise, and inter-patient anatomical variability. This study evaluates deep learning-based nerve segmentation in ultrasound images of the brachial plexus using a U-Net architecture, with a focus on how dataset composition and annotation strategy influence segmentation performance. We find that training on combined data from multiple ultrasound machines (SIEMENS ACUSON NX3 Elite and Philips EPIQ5) provides regularization benefits for lower-performing acquisition sources, though it does not surpass single-source training when matched to the target domain. Extending the task from binary nerve segmentation to multi-class supervision (artery, vein, nerve, muscle) results in decreased nerve-specific Dice scores, with performance drops ranging from 9% to 61% depending on dataset, likely due to class imbalance and boundary ambiguity. Additionally, we observe a moderate positive correlation between nerve size and segmentation accuracy (Pearson r=0.587, p<0.001), indicating that smaller nerves remain a primary challenge. These findings provide methodological guidance for developing robust ultrasound nerve segmentation systems under realistic clinical data constraints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to generalize to novel categories with only a few samples. Recent approaches incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual representations with semantic embeddings derived from class names. However, they overlook progressive and adaptive alignment between vision and language from low-level to high-level semantics, resulting in limited semantic gains. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning gating (DVLA-RL), which consists of Dual-level Semantic Construction (DSC) and RL-gated Attention (RLA). Specifically, DSC conditions LLMs on both class names and support samples to generate discriminative attributes, progressively selects the most relevant ones, and then synthesizes them into coherent class descriptions. This process provides complementary low-level attributes and high-level descriptions, enabling both fine-grained grounding and holistic class understanding. To dynamically integrate dual-level semantics along with the visual network layers, RLA formulates cross-modal fusion as a sequential decision process. A lightweight policy trained with episodic REINFORCE adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and cross-attention to integrate textual and visual tokens. As a result, shallow layers refine local attributes and deep layers emphasize global semantics, enabling more precise cross-modal alignment. This achieves class-specific discrimination and generalized representations with merely a few support samples. DVLA-RL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks in three diverse FSL scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically take 2D images as visual input, which limits their spatial understanding in complex scenes. How can we incorporate 3D information to enhance VLA capabilities? We conduct a pilot study across different observation spaces and visual representations. The results show that explicitly lifting visual input into point clouds yields representations that better complement their corresponding 2D representations. To address the challenges of (1) scarce 3D data and (2) the domain gap induced by cross-environment differences and depth-scale biases, we propose Any3D-VLA. It unifies the simulator, sensor, and model-estimated point clouds within a training pipeline, constructs diverse inputs, and learns domain-agnostic 3D representations that are fused with the corresponding 2D representations. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate Any3D-VLA's advantages in improving performance and mitigating the domain gap.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00810v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Localization is a critical technology in autonomous driving, encompassing both topological localization, which identifies the most similar map keyframe to the current observation, and metric localization, which provides precise spatial coordinates. Conventional methods typically address these tasks independently, rely on single-camera setups, and often require additional 3D semantic or pose priors, while lacking mechanisms to quantify the confidence of localization results, making them less feasible for real industrial applications. In this paper, we propose VVLoc, a unified pipeline that employs a single neural network to concurrently achieve topological and metric vehicle localization using multi-camera system. VVLoc first evaluates the geo-proximity between visual observations, then estimates their relative metric poses using a matching strategy, while also providing a confidence measure. Additionally, the training process for VVLoc is highly efficient, requiring only pairs of visual data and corresponding ground-truth poses, eliminating the need for complex supplementary data. We evaluate VVLoc not only on the publicly available datasets, but also on a more challenging self-collected dataset, demonstrating its ability to deliver state-of-the-art localization accuracy across a wide range of localization tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from a database using a multimodal query, which consists of a reference image and a modification text. The text specifies how to alter the reference image to form a ``mental image'', based on which CIR should find the target image in the database. The fundamental challenge of CIR is that this ``mental image'' is not physically available and is only implicitly defined by the query. The contemporary literature pursues zero-shot methods and uses a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to generate a textual description for a given multimodal query, and then employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for textual-visual matching to search the target image. In contrast, we address CIR from first principles by directly generating the ``mental image'' for more accurate matching. Particularly, we prompt an LMM to generate a ``mental image'' for a given multimodal query and propose to use this ``mental image'' to search for the target image. As the ``mental image'' has a synthetic-to-real domain gap with real images, we also generate a synthetic counterpart for each real image in the database to facilitate matching. In this sense, our method uses LMM to construct a ``paracosm'', where it matches the multimodal query and database images. Hence, we call this method Paracosm. Notably, Paracosm is a training-free zero-shot CIR method. It significantly outperforms existing zero-shot methods on four challenging benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot CIR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of Federated Learning (FL) for clinical dermatology is hindered by the competing requirements of protecting patient privacy and preserving diagnostic features. Traditional de-identification methods often degrade pathological fidelity, while standard generative editing techniques rely on computationally intensive inversion processes unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. We propose a framework for identity-agnostic pathology preservation that serves as a client-side privacy-preserving utility. By leveraging inversion-free Rectified Flow Transformers (FlowEdit), the system performs high-fidelity identity transformation in near real-time (less than 20s), facilitating local deployment on clinical nodes. We introduce a "Segment-by-Synthesis" mechanism that generates counterfactual healthy and pathological twin pairs locally. This enables the extraction of differential erythema masks that are decoupled from biometric markers and semantic artifacts (e.g. jewelry). Pilot validation on high-resolution clinical samples demonstrates an Intersection over Union (IoU) stability greater than 0.67 across synthetic identities. By generating privacy-compliant synthetic surrogates at the edge, this framework mitigates the risk of gradient leakage at the source, providing a secure pathway for high-precision skin image analysis in federated environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00839v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular normal estimation for transparent objects is critical for laboratory automation, yet it remains challenging due to complex light refraction and reflection. These optical properties often lead to catastrophic failures in conventional depth and normal sensors, hindering the deployment of embodied AI in scientific environments. We propose TransNormal, a novel framework that adapts pre-trained diffusion priors for single-step normal regression. To handle the lack of texture in transparent surfaces, TransNormal integrates dense visual semantics from DINOv3 via a cross-attention mechanism, providing strong geometric cues. Furthermore, we employ a multi-task learning objective and wavelet-based regularization to ensure the preservation of fine-grained structural details. To support this task, we introduce TransNormal-Synthetic, a physics-based dataset with high-fidelity normal maps for transparent labware. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransNormal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods: on the ClearGrasp benchmark, it reduces mean error by 24.4% and improves 11.25{\deg} accuracy by 22.8%; on ClearPose, it achieves a 15.2% reduction in mean error. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TransNormal.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) demands representations robust to drastic environmental and viewpoint shifts. Current aggregation paradigms, however, either rely on data-hungry supervision or simplistic first-order statistics, often neglecting intrinsic structural correlations. In this work, we propose a Second-Order Geometric Statistics framework that inherently captures geometric stability without training. We conceptualize scenes as covariance descriptors on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, where perturbations manifest as tractable congruence transformations. By leveraging geometry-aware Riemannian mappings, we project these descriptors into a linearized Euclidean embedding, effectively decoupling signal structure from noise. Our approach introduces a training-free framework built upon fixed, pre-trained backbones, achieving strong zero-shot generalization without parameter updates. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, particularly excelling in challenging zero-shot scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00865v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While multi-view 3D reconstruction has shifted toward large-scale foundation models capable of inferring globally consistent geometry, their reliance on massive computational clusters for training has created a significant barrier to entry for most academic laboratories. To bridge this compute divide, we introduce Distill3R, a framework designed to distill the geometric reasoning of 3D foundation models into compact students fully trainable on a single workstation. Our methodology centers on two primary innovations: (1) an offline caching pipeline that decouples heavy teacher inference from the training loop through compressed supervision signals, and (2) a confidence-aware distillation loss that leverages teacher uncertainty to enable training on commodity hardware. We propose a 72M-parameter student model which achieves a 9x reduction in parameters and a 5x inference speedup compared to its 650M-parameter teacher. The student is fully trainable in under 3 days on a single workstation, whereas its teacher requires massive GPU clusters for up to a week. We demonstrate that the student preserves the structural consistency and qualitative geometric understanding required for functional 3D awareness. By providing a reproducible, single-workstation training recipe, Distill3R serves as an exploratory entry point for democratized 3D vision research and efficient edge deployment. This work is not intended to compete with state-of-the-art foundation models, but to provide an accessible research baseline for laboratories without access to large-scale compute to train and specialize models on their own domain-specific data at minimal cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite impressive results from recent text-to-image models like FLUX, visual and anatomical artifacts remain a significant hurdle for practical and professional use. Existing methods for artifact reduction, typically work in a post-hoc manner, consequently failing to intervene effectively during the core image formation process. Notably, current techniques require problematic and invasive modifications to the model weights, or depend on a computationally expensive and time-consuming process of regional refinement. To address these limitations, we propose DIAMOND, a training-free method that applies trajectory correction to mitigate artifacts during inference. By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00904v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to transformers due to their unique ability of modeling global relationships in text with linear complexity. However, their success in vision tasks has been limited due to their causal formulation, which is suitable for sequential text but detrimental in the spatial domain where causality breaks the inherent spatial relationships among pixels or patches. As a result, standard SSMs fail to capture local spatial coherence, often linking non-adjacent patches while ignoring neighboring ones that are visually correlated. To address these limitations, we introduce OCTOPUS , a novel architecture that preserves both global context and local spatial structure within images, while maintaining the linear complexity of SSMs. OCTOPUS performs discrete reoccurrence along eight principal orientations, going forward or backward in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, allowing effective information exchange across all spatially connected regions while maintaining independence among unrelated patches. This design enables multi-directional recurrence, capturing both global context and local spatial structure with SSM-level efficiency. In our classification and segmentation benchmarks, OCTOPUS demonstrates notable improvements in boundary preservation and region consistency, as evident from the segmentation results, while maintaining relatively better classification accuracy compared to existing V-SSM based models. These results suggest that OCTOPUS appears as a foundation method for multi-directional recurrence as a scalable and effective mechanism for building spatially aware and computationally efficient vision architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00946v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are expensive because the LLM processes hundreds of largely redundant visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods typically exploit \textit{either} vision-encoder saliency (broad but query-agnostic) \textit{or} LLM cross-attention (query-aware but sparse and costly). We show that neither signal alone is sufficient: fusing them consistently improves performance compared to unimodal visual token selection (ranking). However, making such fusion practical is non-trivial: cross-modal saliency is usually only available \emph{inside} the LLM (too late for efficient pre-LLM pruning), and the two signals are inherently asymmetric, so naive fusion underutilizes their complementary strengths. We propose \textbf{ConsensusDrop}, a training-free framework that derives a \emph{consensus} ranking by reconciling vision encoder saliency with query-aware cross-attention, retaining the most informative tokens while compressing the remainder via encoder-guided token merging. Across LLaVA-1.5/NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and other open-source VLMs, ConsensusDrop consistently outperforms prior pruning methods under identical token budgets and delivers a stronger accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier -- preserving near-baseline accuracy even at aggressive token reductions while reducing TTFT and KV cache footprint. Our code will be open-sourced.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and NK cell immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment, and recent studies suggest that the quality of the CAR-T/NK cell immunological synapse (IS) may serve as a functional biomarker for predicting therapeutic efficacy. Accurate detection and segmentation of CAR-T/NK IS structures using artificial neural networks (ANNs) can greatly increase the speed and reliability of IS quantification. However, a persistent challenge is the limited size of annotated microscopy datasets, which restricts the ability of ANNs to generalize. To address this challenge, we integrate two complementary data-augmentation frameworks. First, we employ Instance Aware Automatic Augmentation (IAAA), an automated, instance-preserving augmentation method that generates synthetic CAR-T/NK IS images and corresponding segmentation masks by applying optimized augmentation policies to original IS data. IAAA supports multiple imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence and brightfield) and can be applied directly to CAR-T/NK IS images derived from patient samples. In parallel, we introduce a Semantic-Aware AI Augmentation (SAAA) pipeline that combines a diffusion-based mask generator with a Pix2Pix conditional image synthesizer. This second method enables the creation of diverse, anatomically realistic segmentation masks and produces high-fidelity CAR-T/NK IS images aligned with those masks, further expanding the training corpus beyond what IAAA alone can provide. Together, these augmentation strategies generate synthetic images whose visual and structural properties closely match real IS data, significantly improving CAR-T/NK IS detection and segmentation performance. By enhancing the robustness and accuracy of IS quantification, this work supports the development of more reliable imaging-based biomarkers for predicting patient response to CAR-T/NK immunotherapy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00956v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging-based clinical decision support systems. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with a DenseNet121 backbone for four-class Alzheimer's disease classification using structural MRI data from the OASIS dataset. TDA is employed to capture complementary topological characteristics of brain structures that are often overlooked by conventional neural networks, while DenseNet121 efficiently learns hierarchical spatial features from MRI slices. The extracted deep and topological features are fused to enhance class separability across the four AD stages.   Extensive experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 Kaggle MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed TDA+DenseNet121 model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. The model achieves an accuracy of 99.93% and an AUC of 100%, surpassing recently published CNN-based, transfer learning, ensemble, and multi-scale architectures. These results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating topological insights into deep learning pipelines and highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a robust and highly accurate tool for automated Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their capability for deep emotional understanding remains limited. We argue that genuine affective intelligence requires explicit modeling of Theory of Mind (ToM), the cognitive substrate from which emotions arise. To this end, we introduce HitEmotion, a ToM-grounded hierarchical benchmark that diagnoses capability breakpoints across increasing levels of cognitive depth. Second, we propose a ToM-guided reasoning chain that tracks mental states and calibrates cross-modal evidence to achieve faithful emotional reasoning. We further introduce TMPO, a reinforcement learning method that uses intermediate mental states as process-level supervision to guide and strengthen model reasoning. Extensive experiments show that HitEmotion exposes deep emotional reasoning deficits in state-of-the-art models, especially on cognitively demanding tasks. In evaluation, the ToM-guided reasoning chain and TMPO improve end-task accuracy and yield more faithful, more coherent rationales. In conclusion, our work provides the research community with a practical toolkit for evaluating and enhancing the cognition-based emotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs. Our dataset and code are available at: https://HitEmotion.github.io/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00982v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual robustness and neural alignment remain critical challenges in developing artificial agents that can match biological vision systems. We present the winning approaches from Team HCMUS_TheFangs for both tracks of the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI: Robust Visual Foraging Competition. For Track 1 (Visual Robustness), we demonstrate that architectural simplicity combined with targeted components yields superior generalization, achieving 95.4% final score with a lightweight two-layer CNN enhanced by Gated Linear Units and observation normalization. For Track 2 (Neural Alignment), we develop a deep ResNet-like architecture with 16 convolutional layers and GLU-based gating that achieves top-1 neural prediction performance with 17.8 million parameters. Our systematic analysis of ten model checkpoints trained between 60K to 1.14M steps reveals that training duration exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with performance, with optimal results achieved around 200K steps. Through comprehensive ablation studies and failure case analysis, we provide insights into why simpler architectures excel at visual robustness while deeper models with increased capacity achieve better neural alignment. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about model complexity in visuomotor learning and offer practical guidance for developing robust, biologically-inspired visual agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00995v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Handheld Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) enables noninvasive retinal imaging in uncooperative or pediatric subjects, but is highly susceptible to motion artifacts that severely degrade volumetric image quality. Sudden motion during 3D acquisition can lead to unsampled retinal regions across entire B-scans (cross-sectional slices), resulting in blank bands in en face projections. We propose VAMOS-OCTA, a deep learning framework for inpainting motion-corrupted B-scans using vessel-aware multi-axis supervision. We employ a 2.5D U-Net architecture that takes a stack of neighboring B-scans as input to reconstruct a corrupted center B-scan, guided by a novel Vessel-Aware Multi-Axis Orthogonal Supervision (VAMOS) loss. This loss combines vessel-weighted intensity reconstruction with axial and lateral projection consistency, encouraging vascular continuity in native B-scans and across orthogonal planes. Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on restoring the en face MIP, VAMOS-OCTA jointly enhances both cross-sectional B-scan sharpness and volumetric projection accuracy, even under severe motion corruptions. We trained our model on both synthetic and real-world corrupted volumes and evaluated its performance using both perceptual quality and pixel-wise accuracy metrics. VAMOS-OCTA consistently outperforms prior methods, producing reconstructions with sharp capillaries, restored vessel continuity, and clean en face projections. These results demonstrate that multi-axis supervision offers a powerful constraint for restoring motion-degraded 3D OCTA data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is the primary diagnostic modality for detecting Gallbladder diseases due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and wide accessibility. However, the low resolution and speckle noise inherent to ultrasound images hinder diagnostic reliability, prompting the use of large convolutional neural networks that are difficult to deploy in routine clinical settings. In this work, we propose CortiNet, a lightweight, cortical-inspired dual-stream neural architecture for gallbladder disease diagnosis that integrates physically interpretable multi-scale signal decomposition with perception-driven feature learning. Inspired by parallel processing pathways in the human visual cortex, CortiNet explicitly separates low-frequency structural information from high-frequency perceptual details and processes them through specialized encoding streams. By operating directly on structured, frequency-selective representations rather than raw pixel intensities, the architecture embeds strong physics-based inductive bias, enabling efficient feature learning with a significantly reduced parameter footprint. A late-stage cortical-style fusion mechanism integrates complementary structural and textural cues while preserving computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose a structure-aware explainability framework wherein gradient-weighted class activation mapping is only applied to the structural branch of the proposed CortiNet architecture. This choice allows the model to only focus on the structural features, making it robust against speckle noise. We evaluate CortiNet on 10,692 expert-annotated images spanning nine clinically relevant gallbladder disease categories. Experimental results demonstrate that CortiNet achieves high diagnostic accuracy (98.74%) with only a fraction of the parameters required by conventional deep convolutional models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01004v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in reasoning capabilities and shown promising effectiveness in video anomaly understanding (VAU) tasks. However, existing MLLM-based approaches remain largely focused on surface-level descriptions of anomalies, lacking deep reasoning over abnormal behaviors like explicit self-reflection and self-correction. To address that, we propose Self-Reflection-Enhanced Reasoning for Video Anomaly Understanding (SRVAU-R1), a reflection-aware learning framework that incorporates reflection in MLLM reasoning. Specifically, SRVAU-R1 introduces the first reflection-oriented Chain-of-Thought dataset tailored for VAU, providing structured supervision with initial reasoning, self-reflection, and revised reasoning. Based on that, it includes a novel reflection-aware learning paradigm with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance multi-modal reasoning for VAU. Extensive experiments on multiple video anomaly benchmarks demonstrate that SRVAU-R1 consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in both temporal anomaly localization accuracy and reasoning quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-set biometrics faces challenges with probe subjects who may not be enrolled in the gallery, as traditional biometric systems struggle to detect these non-mated probes. Despite the growing prevalence of multi-sample galleries in real-world deployments, most existing methods collapse intra-subject variability into a single global representation, leading to suboptimal decision boundaries and poor open-set robustness. To address this issue, we propose LocalScore, a simple yet effective scoring algorithm that explicitly incorporates the local density of the gallery feature distribution using the k-th nearest neighbors. LocalScore is architecture-agnostic, loss-independent, and incurs negligible computational overhead, making it a plug-and-play solution for existing biometric systems. Extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that LocalScore consistently achieves substantial gains in open-set retrieval (FNIR@FPIR reduced from 53% to 40%) and verification (TAR@FAR improved from 51% to 74%). We further provide theoretical analysis and empirical validation explaining when and why the method achieves the most significant gains based on dataset characteristics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01020v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The diagnosis of thyroid nodule cancers commonly utilizes ultrasound images. Several studies showed that deep learning algorithms designed to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules could match radiologists' performance. However, data availability for training deep learning models is often limited due to the significant effort required to curate such datasets. The previous study proposed a method to curate thyroid nodule datasets automatically. It was tested to have a 63% yield rate and 83% accuracy. However, the usefulness of the generated data for training deep learning models remains unknown. In this study, we conducted experiments to determine whether using a automatically-curated dataset improves deep learning algorithms' performance. We trained deep learning models on the manually annotated and automatically-curated datasets. We also trained with a smaller subset of the automatically-curated dataset that has higher accuracy to explore the optimum usage of such dataset. As a result, the deep learning model trained on the manually selected dataset has an AUC of 0.643 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.66). It is significantly lower than the AUC of the 6automatically-curated dataset trained deep learning model, 0.694 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 0.73, P < .001). The AUC of the accurate subset trained deep learning model is 0.689 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.72, P > .43), which is insignificantly worse than the AUC of the full automatically-curated dataset. In conclusion, we showed that using a automatically-curated dataset can substantially increase the performance of deep learning algorithms, and it is suggested to use all the data rather than only using the accurate subset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01033v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic calibration of multi-camera systems, namely the accurate estimation of spatial extrinsic parameters, is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, panoramic perception, and multi-view data fusion. Existing methods typically rely on calibration targets, explicit geometric modeling, or task-specific neural networks. Such approaches often exhibit limited robustness and applicability in complex dynamic environments or online scenarios, making them difficult to deploy in practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes GMAC, a multi-camera extrinsic estimation framework based on the implicit geometric representations learned by multi-view reconstruction networks. GMAC models extrinsics as global variables constrained by the latent multi-view geometric structure and prunes and structurally reconfigures existing networks so that their latent features can directly support extrinsic prediction through a lightweight regression head, without requiring a completely new network design. Furthermore, GMAC jointly optimizes cross-view reprojection consistency and multi-view cycle consistency, ensuring geometric coherence across cameras while improving prediction accuracy and optimization stability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-camera datasets demonstrate that GMAC achieves accurate and stable extrinsic estimation without explicit 3D reconstruction or manual calibration, providing a new solution for efficient deployment and online calibration of multi-camera systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time multi-view point cloud reconstruction is a core problem in 3D vision and immersive perception, with wide applications in VR, AR, robotic navigation, digital twins, and computer interaction. Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01037v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer remarkable performance but incur prohibitive memory and computational costs, making compression essential. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, under the W3A16 configuration, our method achieves significant average accuracy gains of 2.04\% on Kimi-VL and 3.09\% on Qwen3-VL compared to the previous SOTA quantization methods, demonstrating superior robustness across various multimodal tasks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/guangshuoqin/VEQ.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many everyday tasks, ranging from appliance repair and cooking to car maintenance, require expert knowledge, particularly for complex, multi-step procedures. Despite growing interest in AI agents for augmented reality (AR) assistance, progress remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale multimodal conversational datasets grounded in real-world task execution, in part due to the cost and logistical complexity of human-assisted data collection. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically transform single person instructional videos into two-person multimodal task-guidance conversations. Our fully automatic pipeline, based on large language models, provides a scalable and cost efficient alternative to traditional data collection approaches. Using this framework, we introduce HowToDIV, a multimodal dataset comprising 507 conversations, 6,636 question answer pairs, and 24 hours of video spanning multiple domains. Each session consists of a multi-turn expert-novice interaction. Finally, we report baseline results using Gemma 3 and Qwen 2.5 on HowToDIV, providing an initial benchmark for multimodal procedural task assistance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated redesign without manual adjustments marks a key step forward in the design workflow. In this work, we focus on a foundational redesign task termed design layout editing, which seeks to autonomously modify the geometric composition of a design based on user intents. To overcome the ambiguity of user needs expressed in natural language, we introduce four basic and important editing actions and standardize the format of editing operations. The underexplored task presents a unique challenge: satisfying specified editing operations while simultaneously preserving the layout structure of unedited elements. Besides, the scarcity of triplet (original design, editing operation, edited design) samples poses another formidable challenge. To this end, we present ReLayout, a novel framework for versatile and structure-preserving design layout editing that operates without triplet data. Specifically, ReLayout first introduces the relation graph, which contains the position and size relationships among unedited elements, as the constraint for layout structure preservation. Then, relation-aware design reconstruction (RADR) is proposed to bypass the data challenge. By learning to reconstruct a design from its elements, a relation graph, and a synthesized editing operation, RADR effectively emulates the editing process in a self-supervised manner. A multi-modal large language model serves as the backbone for RADR, unifying multiple editing actions within a single model and thus achieving versatile editing after fine-tuning. Qualitative, quantitative results and user studies show that ReLayout significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of editing quality, accuracy, and layout structure preservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively from image-text inputs and perform well in various multimodal tasks. Despite this success, they are affected by language priors and often produce hallucinations. Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging exhibits substantial heterogeneity across anatomical structures and acquisition protocols, posing significant challenges to the development of generalizable analysis models. Most existing methods are task-specific, limiting their suitability as clinically deployable foundation models. To address this limitation, the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis (FM\_UIA~2026) introduces a large-scale multi-task benchmark comprising 27 subtasks across segmentation, classification, detection, and regression. In this paper, we present the official baseline for FM\_UIA~2026 based on a unified Multi-Head Multi-Task Learning (MH-MTL) framework that supports all tasks within a single shared network. The model employs an ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet--B4 backbone for robust feature extraction, combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to capture multi-scale contextual information. A task-specific routing strategy enables global tasks to leverage high-level semantic features, while dense prediction tasks exploit spatially detailed FPN representations. Training incorporates a composite loss with task-adaptive learning rate scaling and a cosine annealing schedule. Validation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of this unified design, establishing a strong and extensible baseline for ultrasound foundation model research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged in computer vision as a promising rendering technique. By adapting the principles of Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA) splatting to a modern differentiable pipeline, 3DGS enables real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis. Building upon this, R2-Gaussian extended the 3DGS paradigm to tomographic reconstruction by rectifying integration bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance in computed tomography (CT). To enable differentiability, R2-Gaussian adopts a local affine approximation: each 3D Gaussian is locally mapped to a 2D Gaussian on the detector and composed via alpha blending to form projections. However, the affine approximation can degrade reconstruction quantitative accuracy and complicate the incorporation of nonlinear geometric corrections. To address these limitations, we propose a tomographic reconstruction framework based on 3D Gaussian ray tracing. Our approach provides two key advantages over splatting-based models: (i) it computes the line integral through 3D Gaussian primitives analytically, avoiding the local affine collapse and thus yielding a more physically consistent forward projection model; and (ii) the ray-tracing formulation gives explicit control over ray origins and directions, which facilitates the precise application of nonlinear geometric corrections, e.g., arc-correction used in positron emission tomography (PET). These properties extend the applicability of Gaussian-based reconstruction to a wider range of realistic tomography systems while improving projection accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Both fine-grained discriminative details and global semantic features can contribute to solving person re-identification challenges, such as occlusion and pose variations. Vision foundation models (\textit{e.g.}, DINO) excel at mining local textures, and vision-language models (\textit{e.g.}, CLIP) capture strong global semantic difference. Existing methods predominantly rely on a single paradigm, neglecting the potential benefits of their integration. In this paper, we analyze the complementary roles of these two architectures and propose a framework to synergize their strengths by a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{R}egularized Bidirectional \textbf{Transformer} (\textbf{DRFormer}). The dual-regularization mechanism ensures diverse feature extraction and achieves a better balance in the contributions of the two models. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our method effectively harmonizes local and global representations, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segmentation of microscopy images constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem due to measurement noise, weak object boundaries, and limited labeled data. Although deep neural networks provide flexible nonparametric estimators, unconstrained empirical risk minimization often leads to unstable solutions and poor generalization. In this work, image segmentation is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that integrates physically motivated priors into deep learning models through variational regularization. The proposed framework minimizes a composite objective function consisting of a data fidelity term and penalty terms derived from reaction-diffusion equations and phase-field interface energies, all implemented as differentiable residual losses. Experiments are conducted on the LIVECell dataset, a high-quality, manually annotated collection of phase-contrast microscopy images. Training is performed on two cell types, while evaluation is carried out on a distinct, unseen cell type to assess generalization. A UNet architecture is used as the unconstrained baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy and boundary fidelity compared to unconstrained deep learning baselines. Moreover, the PDE-regularized models exhibit enhanced stability and improved generalization in low-sample regimes, highlighting the advantages of incorporating structured priors. The proposed approach illustrates how PDE-constrained optimization can strengthen data-driven learning frameworks, providing a principled bridge between variational methods, statistical learning, and scientific machine learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformers are fundamental for video and image generation, but their efficiency is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of attention. While block sparse attention accelerates computation by attending only critical key-value blocks, it suffers from degradation at high sparsity by discarding context. In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, a training-free Piecewise Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces a novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as a faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 times and 2.57 times speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves a 1.2 times acceleration without compromising visual quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01081v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical Anomaly Detection (MedAD) presents a significant opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to interpret and answer questions based on medical images. However, the reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on simplistic and fragmented datasets has hindered the development of models capable of plausible reasoning and robust multimodal generalization. To overcome this, we introduce MedAD-38K, the first large-scale, multi-modal, and multi-center benchmark for MedAD featuring diagnostic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations alongside structured Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs. On this foundation, we propose a two-stage training framework. The first stage, Cognitive Injection, uses SFT to instill foundational medical knowledge and align the model with a structured think-then-answer paradigm. Given that standard policy optimization can produce reasoning that is disconnected from the final answer, the second stage incorporates Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (Con-GRPO). This novel algorithm incorporates a crucial consistency reward to ensure the generated reasoning process is relevant and logically coherent with the final diagnosis. Our proposed model, MedAD-R1, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MedAD-38K benchmark, outperforming strong baselines by more than 10\%. This superior performance stems from its ability to generate transparent and logically consistent reasoning pathways, offering a promising approach to enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI for clinical decision support.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images, yet their tendency to reproduce undesirable concepts, such as NSFW content, copyrighted styles, or specific objects, poses growing concerns for safe and controllable deployment. While existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on DDPM-based diffusion models and rely on costly fine-tuning, the recent emergence of flow matching models introduces a fundamentally different generative paradigm for which prior methods are not directly applicable. In this paper, we propose Differential Vector Erasure (DVE), a training-free concept erasure method specifically designed for flow matching models. Our key insight is that semantic concepts are implicitly encoded in the directional structure of the velocity field governing the generative flow. Leveraging this observation, we construct a differential vector field that characterizes the directional discrepancy between a target concept and a carefully chosen anchor concept. During inference, DVE selectively removes concept-specific components by projecting the velocity field onto the differential direction, enabling precise concept suppression without affecting irrelevant semantics. Extensive experiments on FLUX demonstrate that DVE consistently outperforms existing baselines on a wide range of concept erasure tasks, including NSFW suppression, artistic style removal, and object erasure, while preserving image quality and diversity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D human pose lifting from a single RGB image is a challenging task in 3D vision. Existing methods typically establish a direct joint-to-joint mapping from 2D to 3D poses based on 2D features. This formulation suffers from two fundamental limitations: inevitable error propagation from input predicted 2D pose to 3D predictions and inherent difficulties in handling self-occlusion cases. In this paper, we propose PandaPose, a 3D human pose lifting approach via propagating 2D pose prior to 3D anchor space as the unified intermediate representation. Specifically, our 3D anchor space comprises: (1) Joint-wise 3D anchors in the canonical coordinate system, providing accurate and robust priors to mitigate 2D pose estimation inaccuracies. (2) Depth-aware joint-wise feature lifting that hierarchically integrates depth information to resolve self-occlusion ambiguities. (3) The anchor-feature interaction decoder that incorporates 3D anchors with lifted features to generate unified anchor queries encapsulating joint-wise 3D anchor set, visual cues and geometric depth information. The anchor queries are further employed to facilitate anchor-to-joint ensemble prediction. Experiments on three well-established benchmarks (i.e., Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW) demonstrate the superiority of our proposition. The substantial reduction in error by $14.7\%$ compared to SOTA methods on the challenging conditions of Human3.6M and qualitative comparisons further showcase the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01101v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Internet memes are powerful tools for communication, capable of spreading political, psychological, and sociocultural ideas. However, they can be harmful and can be used to disseminate hate toward targeted individuals or groups. Although previous studies have focused on designing new detection methods, these often rely on modal-complete data, such as text and images. In real-world settings, however, modalities like text may be missing due to issues like poor OCR quality, making existing methods sensitive to missing information and leading to performance deterioration. To address this gap, in this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to comprehensively investigate the behavior of harmful meme detection methods in the presence of modal-incomplete data. Specifically, we propose a new baseline method that learns a shared representation for multiple modalities by projecting them independently. These shared representations can then be leveraged when data is modal-incomplete. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches when text is missing. Moreover, these results suggest that our method allows for better integration of visual features, reducing dependence on text and improving robustness in scenarios where textual information is missing. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of harmful meme detection, particularly in situations where a modality is absent.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01118v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inverse rendering in urban scenes is pivotal for applications like autonomous driving and digital twins. Yet, it faces significant challenges due to complex illumination conditions, including multi-illumination and indirect light and shadow effects. However, the effects of these challenges on intrinsic decomposition and 3D reconstruction have not been explored due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we present LightCity, a novel high-quality synthetic urban dataset featuring diverse illumination conditions with realistic indirect light and shadow effects. LightCity encompasses over 300 sky maps with highly controllable illumination, varying scales with street-level and aerial perspectives over 50K images, and rich properties such as depth, normal, material components, light and indirect light, etc. Besides, we leverage LightCity to benchmark three fundamental tasks in the urban environments and conduct a comprehensive analysis of these benchmarks, laying a robust foundation for advancing related research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual-language models such as CLIP provide powerful general-purpose representations, but their raw embeddings are not optimized for supervised classification, often exhibiting limited class separation and excessive dimensionality. We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations.   Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generalist robotic manipulation, unifying perception and control within a single end-to-end architecture. However, despite their success in controlled environments, reliable real-world deployment is severely hindered by their fragility to visual disturbances. While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $\pi_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\% success rates to as low as 2\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safe UAV emergency landing requires more than just identifying flat terrain; it demands understanding complex semantic risks (e.g., crowds, temporary structures) invisible to traditional geometric sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel framework leveraging Remote Sensing (RS) imagery and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for global context-aware landing site assessment. Unlike local geometric methods, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine pipeline: first, a lightweight semantic segmentation module efficiently pre-screens candidate areas; second, a vision-language reasoning agent fuses visual features with Point-of-Interest (POI) data to detect subtle hazards. To validate this approach, we construct and release the Emergency Landing Site Selection (ELSS) benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms geometric baselines in risk identification accuracy. Furthermore, qualitative results confirm its ability to generate human-like, interpretable justifications, enhancing trust in automated decision-making. The benchmark dataset is publicly accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ELSS-dataset-43D7.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding the multi-dimensional attributes and intensity nuances of image-evoked emotions is pivotal for advancing machine empathy and empowering diverse human-computer interaction applications. However, existing models are still limited to coarse-grained emotion perception or deficient reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce EEmoDB, the largest image-evoked emotion understanding dataset to date. It features $5$ analysis dimensions spanning $5$ distinct task categories, facilitating comprehensive interpretation. Specifically, we compile $1.2M$ question-answering (QA) pairs (EEmoDB-QA) from $125k$ images via automated generation, alongside a $36k$ dataset (EEmoDB-Assess) curated from $25k$ images for fine-grained assessment. Furthermore, we propose EEmo-Logic, an all-in-one multimodal large language model (MLLM) developed via instruction fine-tuning and task-customized group relative preference optimization (GRPO) with novel reward design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EEmo-Logic achieves robust performance in in-domain and cross-domain datasets, excelling in emotion QA and fine-grained assessment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01183v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Biological learning proceeds from easy to difficult tasks, gradually reinforcing perception and robustness. Inspired by this principle, we address Context-Entangled Content Segmentation (CECS), a challenging setting where objects share intrinsic visual patterns with their surroundings, as in camouflaged object detection. Conventional segmentation networks predominantly rely on architectural enhancements but often ignore the learning dynamics that govern robustness under entangled data distributions. We introduce CurriSeg, a dual-phase learning framework that unifies curriculum and anti-curriculum principles to improve representation reliability. In the Curriculum Selection phase, CurriSeg dynamically selects training data based on the temporal statistics of sample losses, distinguishing hard-but-informative samples from noisy or ambiguous ones, thus enabling stable capability enhancement. In the Anti-Curriculum Promotion phase, we design Spectral-Blindness Fine-Tuning, which suppresses high-frequency components to enforce dependence on low-frequency structural and contextual cues and thus strengthens generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CurriSeg achieves consistent improvements across diverse CECS benchmarks without adding parameters or increasing total training time, offering a principled view of how progression and challenge interplay to foster robust and context-aware segmentation. Code will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01194v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term weather forecasting is critical for socioeconomic planning and disaster preparedness. While recent approaches employ finetuning to extend prediction horizons, they remain constrained by the issues of catastrophic forgetting, error accumulation, and high training overhead. To address these limitations, we present a novel pipeline across pretraining, finetuning and forecasting to enhance long-context modeling while reducing computational overhead. First, we introduce an Efficient Multi-scale Transformer (EMFormer) to extract multi-scale features through a single convolution in both training and inference. Based on the new architecture, we further employ an accumulative context finetuning to improve temporal consistency without degrading short-term accuracy. Additionally, we propose a composite loss that dynamically balances different terms via a sinusoidal weighting, thereby adaptively guiding the optimization trajectory throughout pretraining and finetuning. Experiments show that our approach achieves strong performance in weather forecasting and extreme event prediction, substantially improving long-term forecast accuracy. Moreover, EMFormer demonstrates strong generalization on vision benchmarks (ImageNet-1K and ADE20K) while delivering a 5.69x speedup over conventional multi-scale modules.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing 3D vision-language models with robust clinical reasoning remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of volumetric medical imaging, the tendency of models to overfit superficial report patterns, and the lack of interpretability-aware reward designs. In this paper, we propose Med3D-R1, a reinforcement learning framework with a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). During SFT stage, we introduce a residual alignment mechanism to bridge the gap between high-dimensional 3D features and textual embeddings, and an abnormality re-weighting strategy to emphasize clinically informative tokens and reduce structural bias in reports. In RL stage, we redesign the consistency reward to explicitly promote coherent, step-by-step diagnostic reasoning. We evaluate our method on medical multiple-choice visual question answering using two 3D diagnostic benchmarks, CT-RATE and RAD-ChestCT, where our model attains state-of-the-art accuracies of 41.92\% on CT-RATE and 44.99\% on RAD-ChestCT. These results indicate improved abnormality diagnosis and clinical reasoning and outperform prior methods on both benchmarks. Overall, our approach holds promise for enhancing real-world diagnostic workflows by enabling more reliable and transparent 3D medical vision-language systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01257v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, point-supervised temporal action localization has gained significant attention for its effective balance between labeling costs and localization accuracy. However, current methods only consider features from visual inputs, neglecting helpful semantic information from the text side. To address this issue, we propose a Text Refinement and Alignment (TRA) framework that effectively utilizes textual features from visual descriptions to complement the visual features as they are semantically rich. This is achieved by designing two new modules for the original point-supervised framework: a Point-based Text Refinement module (PTR) and a Point-based Multimodal Alignment module (PMA). Specifically, we first generate descriptions for video frames using a pre-trained multimodal model. Next, PTR refines the initial descriptions by leveraging point annotations together with multiple pre-trained models. PMA then projects all features into a unified semantic space and leverages a point-level multimodal feature contrastive learning to reduce the gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Last, the enhanced multi-modal features are fed into the action detector for precise localization. Extensive experimental results on five widely used benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our computational overhead analysis shows that the framework can run on a single 24 GB RTX 3090 GPU, indicating its practicality and scalability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent monocular foundation models excel at zero-shot depth estimation, yet their outputs are inherently relative rather than metric, limiting direct use in robotics and autonomous driving. We leverage the fact that relative depth preserves global layout and boundaries: by calibrating it with sparse range measurements, we transform it into a pseudo metric depth prior. Building on this prior, we design a refinement network that follows the prior where reliable and deviates where necessary, enabling accurate metric predictions from very few labeled samples. The resulting system is particularly effective when curated validation data are unavailable, sustaining stable scale and sharp edges across few-shot regimes. These findings suggest that coupling foundation priors with sparse anchors is a practical route to robust, deployment-ready depth completion under real-world label scarcity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged in Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) to generate high-quality textures, yet their heavy inference burden hinders real-world deployment. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for acceleration, existing methods in super-resolution mostly focus on U-Net architectures, whereas generic DiT quantization is typically designed for text-to-image tasks. Directly applying these methods to DiT-based super-resolution models leads to severe degradation of local textures. Therefore, we propose Q-DiT4SR, the first PTQ framework specifically tailored for DiT-based Real-ISR. We propose H-SVD, a hierarchical SVD that integrates a global low-rank branch with a local block-wise rank-1 branch under a matched parameter budget. We further propose Variance-aware Spatio-Temporal Mixed Precision: VaSMP allocates cross-layer weight bit-widths in a data-free manner based on rate-distortion theory, while VaTMP schedules intra-layer activation precision across diffusion timesteps via dynamic programming (DP) with minimal calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our Q-DiT4SR achieves SOTA performance under both W4A6 and W4A4 settings. Notably, the W4A4 quantization configuration reduces model size by 5.8$\times$ and computational operations by over 60$\times$. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/xunzhang1128/Q-DiT4SR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving systems require robust lane perception capabilities, yet existing vision-based detection methods suffer significant performance degradation when visual sensors provide insufficient cues, such as in occluded or lane-missing scenarios. While some approaches incorporate high-definition maps as supplementary information, these solutions face challenges of high subscription costs and limited real-time performance. To address these limitations, we explore an innovative information source: traffic flow, which offers real-time capabilities without additional costs. This paper proposes a TrafficFlow-aware Lane perception Module (TFM) that effectively extracts real-time traffic flow features and seamlessly integrates them with existing lane perception algorithms. This solution originated from real-world autonomous driving conditions and was subsequently validated on open-source algorithms and datasets. Extensive experiments on four mainstream models and two public datasets (Nuscenes and OpenLaneV2) using standard evaluation metrics show that TFM consistently improves performance, achieving up to +4.1% mAP gain on the Nuscenes dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate extraction of rural roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is essential for infrastructure planning and sustainable development. However, this task presents unique challenges in rural settings due to several factors. These include high intra-class variability and low inter-class separability from diverse surface materials, frequent vegetation occlusions that disrupt spatial continuity, and narrow road widths that exacerbate detection difficulties. Existing methods, primarily optimized for structured urban environments, often underperform in these scenarios as they overlook such distinctive characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose DSFC-Net, a dual-encoder framework that synergistically fuses spatial and frequency-domain information. Specifically, a CNN branch is employed to capture fine-grained local road boundaries and short-range continuity, while a novel Spatial-Frequency Hybrid Transformer (SFT) is introduced to robustly model global topological dependencies against vegetation occlusions. Distinct from standard attention mechanisms that suffer from frequency bias, the SFT incorporates a Cross-Frequency Interaction Attention (CFIA) module that explicitly decouples high- and low-frequency information via a Laplacian Pyramid strategy. This design enables the dynamic interaction between spatial details and frequency-aware global contexts, effectively preserving the connectivity of narrow roads. Furthermore, a Channel Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is proposed to bridge the two branches by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses, seamlessly integrating local textures with global semantics for accurate segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the WHU-RuR+, DeepGlobe, and Massachusetts datasets validate the superiority of DSFC-Net over state-of-the-art approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01283v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multilingual safety remains significantly imbalanced, leaving non-high-resource (NHR) languages vulnerable compared to robust high-resource (HR) ones. Moreover, the neural mechanisms driving safety alignment remain unclear despite observed cross-lingual representation transfer.   In this paper, we find that LLMs contain a set of cross-lingual shared safety neurons (SS-Neurons), a remarkably small yet critical neuronal subset that jointly regulates safety behavior across languages.   We first identify monolingual safety neurons (MS-Neurons) and validate their causal role in safety refusal behavior through targeted activation and suppression.   Our cross-lingual analyses then identify SS-Neurons as the subset of MS-Neurons shared between HR and NHR languages, serving as a bridge to transfer safety capabilities from HR to NHR domains.   We observe that suppressing these neurons causes concurrent safety drops across NHR languages, whereas reinforcing them improves cross-lingual defensive consistency.   Building on these insights, we propose a simple neuron-oriented training strategy that targets SS-Neurons based on language resource distribution and model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning this tiny neuronal subset outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing NHR safety while maintaining the model's general capabilities.   The code and dataset will be available athttps://github.com/1518630367/SS-Neuron-Expansion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D line mapping from multi-view RGB images provides a compact and structured visual representation of scenes. We study the problem from a physical and topological perspective: a 3D line most naturally emerges as the edge of a finite 3D planar patch. We present LiP-Map, a line-plane joint optimization framework that explicitly models learnable line and planar primitives. This coupling enables accurate and detailed 3D line mapping while maintaining strong efficiency (typically completing a reconstruction in 3 to 5 minutes per scene). LiP-Map pioneers the integration of planar topology into 3D line mapping, not by imposing pairwise coplanarity constraints but by explicitly constructing interactions between plane and line primitives, thus offering a principled route toward structured reconstruction in man-made environments. On more than 100 scenes from ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, Hypersim, 7Scenes, and Tanks\&amp;Temple, LiP-Map improves both accuracy and completeness over state-of-the-art methods. Beyond line mapping quality, LiP-Map significantly advances line-assisted visual localization, establishing strong performance on 7Scenes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image-based object removal often erases only the named target, leaving behind interaction evidence that renders the result semantically inconsistent. We formalize this problem as Interaction-Consistent Object Removal (ICOR), which requires removing not only the target object but also associated interaction elements, such as lighting-dependent effects, physically connected objects, targetproduced elements, and contextually linked objects. To address this task, we propose Reasoning-Enhanced Object Removal with MLLM (REORM), a reasoningenhanced object removal framework that leverages multimodal large language models to infer which elements must be jointly removed. REORM features a modular design that integrates MLLM-driven analysis, mask-guided removal, and a self-correction mechanism, along with a local-deployment variant that supports accurate editing under limited resources. To support evaluation, we introduce ICOREval, a benchmark consisting of instruction-driven removals with rich interaction dependencies. On ICOREval, REORM outperforms state-of-the-art image editing systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing interactionconsistent results.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01303v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating coherent visual stories requires maintaining subject identity across multiple images while preserving frame-specific semantics. Recent training-free methods concatenate identity and frame prompts into a unified representation, but this often introduces inter-frame semantic interference that weakens identity preservation in complex stories. We propose ReDiStory, a training-free framework that improves multi-frame story generation via inference-time prompt embedding reorganization. ReDiStory explicitly decomposes text embeddings into identity-related and frame-specific components, then decorrelates frame embeddings by suppressing shared directions across frames. This reduces cross-frame interference without modifying diffusion parameters or requiring additional supervision. Under identical diffusion backbones and inference settings, ReDiStory improves identity consistency while maintaining prompt fidelity. Experiments on the ConsiStory+ benchmark show consistent gains over 1Prompt1Story on multiple identity consistency metrics. Code is available at: https://github.com/YuZhenyuLindy/ReDiStory

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01305v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large multimodal models have enabled one-click storybook generation, where users provide a short description and receive a multi-page illustrated story. However, the underlying story state, such as characters, world settings, and page-level objects, remains implicit, making edits coarse-grained and often breaking visual consistency. We present StoryState, an agent-based orchestration layer that introduces an explicit and editable story state on top of training-free text-to-image generation. StoryState represents each story as a structured object composed of a character sheet, global settings, and per-page scene constraints, and employs a small set of LLM agents to maintain this state and derive 1Prompt1Story-style prompts for generation and editing. Operating purely through prompts, StoryState is model-agnostic and compatible with diverse generation backends. System-level experiments on multi-page editing tasks show that StoryState enables localized page edits, improves cross-page consistency, and reduces unintended changes, interaction turns, and editing time compared to 1Prompt1Story, while approaching the one-shot consistency of Gemini Storybook.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Maintaining visual and semantic consistency across frames is a key challenge in text-to-image storytelling. Existing training-free methods, such as One-Prompt-One-Story, concatenate all prompts into a single sequence, which often induces strong embedding correlation and leads to color leakage, background blending, and identity drift. We propose DeCorStory, a training-free inference-time framework that explicitly reduces inter-frame semantic interference. DeCorStory applies Gram-Schmidt prompt embedding decorrelation to orthogonalize frame-level semantics, followed by singular value reweighting to strengthen prompt-specific information and identity-preserving cross-attention to stabilize character identity during diffusion. The method requires no model modification or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion pipelines. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt-image alignment, identity consistency, and visual diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance among training-free baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a powerful approach for high-quality visual generation. However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $>2.5\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision tool-use reinforcement learning (RL) can equip vision-language models with visual operators such as crop-and-zoom and achieves strong performance gains, yet it remains unclear whether these gains are driven by improvements in tool use or evolving intrinsic capabilities.We introduce MED (Measure-Explain-Diagnose), a coarse-to-fine framework that disentangles intrinsic capability changes from tool-induced effects, decomposes the tool-induced performance difference into gain and harm terms, and probes the mechanisms driving their evolution. Across checkpoint-level analyses on two VLMs with different tool priors and six benchmarks, we find that improvements are dominated by intrinsic learning, while tool-use RL mainly reduces tool-induced harm (e.g., fewer call-induced errors and weaker tool schema interference) and yields limited progress in tool-based correction of intrinsic failures. Overall, current vision tool-use RL learns to coexist safely with tools rather than master them.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A visual metaphor constitutes a high-order form of human creativity, employing cross-domain semantic fusion to transform abstract concepts into impactful visual rhetoric. Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the "creative essence" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar ("G"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in metaphor consistency, analogy appropriateness, and visual creativity, paving the way for automated high-impact creative applications in advertising and media. Source code will be made publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) rely on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to compress videos into compact latent representations. For continuous Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), achieving higher compression rates is desirable; yet, the efficiency notably declines when extra sampling layers are added without expanding the dimensions of hidden channels. In this paper, we present a technique to convert fixed compression rate VAEs into models that support multi-level temporal compression, providing a straightforward and minimal fine-tuning approach to counteract performance decline at elevated compression rates.Moreover, we examine how varying compression levels impact model performance over video segments with diverse characteristics, offering empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also investigate the integration of our multi-level temporal compression VAE with diffusion-based generative models, DiT, highlighting successful concurrent training and compatibility within these frameworks. This investigation illustrates the potential uses of multi-level temporal compression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01345v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) suffers from substantial computational cost due to the massive token count involved. Failing to account for the continuous evolution of modeling dynamics, existing VAR token reduction methods face three key limitations: heuristic stage partition, non-adaptive schedules, and limited acceleration scope, thereby leaving significant acceleration potential untapped. Since entropy variation intrinsically reflects the transition of predictive uncertainty, it offers a principled measure to capture modeling dynamics evolution. Therefore, we propose NOVA, a training-free token reduction acceleration framework for VAR models via entropy analysis. NOVA adaptively determines the acceleration activation scale during inference by online identifying the inflection point of scale entropy growth. Through scale-linkage and layer-linkage ratio adjustment, NOVA dynamically computes distinct token reduction ratios for each scale and layer, pruning low-entropy tokens while reusing the cache derived from the residuals at the prior scale to accelerate inference and maintain generation quality. Extensive experiments and analyses validate NOVA as a simple yet effective training-free acceleration framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which converts motion language descriptions into coherent 3D human motion sequences, has attracted increasing attention in fields, such as avatar animation and humanoid robotic interaction. Though existing models have achieved significant fidelity, they still suffer from two core limitations: (i) They treat motion periodicity and keyframe saliency as independent factors, overlooking their coupling and causing generation drift in long sequences. (ii) They are fragile to semantically equivalent paraphrases, where minor synonym substitutions distort textual embeddings, propagating through the decoder and producing unstable or erroneous motions. In this work, we propose T2M Mamba to address these limitations by (i) proposing Periodicity-Saliency Aware Mamba, which utilizes novel algorithms for keyframe weight estimation via enhanced Density Peaks Clustering and motion periodicity estimation via FFT-accelerated autocorrelation to capture coupled dynamics with minimal computational overhead, and (ii) constructing a Periodic Differential Cross-modal Alignment Module (PDCAM) to enhance robust alignment of textual and motion embeddings. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets have been conducted, confirming the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an FID of 0.068 and consistent gains on all other metrics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated strong performance in video understanding tasks, yet its adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Existing attack methods often treat MoE as a unified architecture, overlooking the independent and collaborative weaknesses of key components such as routers and expert modules. To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles' Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models. It consistently enhances adversarial robustness across diverse datasets and architectures, effectively mitigating both the independent and collaborative weaknesses of MoE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01370v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic data offers a scalable solution for vision-language pre-training, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on scaling up a single generative backbone, which introduces generator-specific spectral biases and limits feature diversity. In this work, we introduce PolyGen, a framework that redefines synthetic data construction by prioritizing manifold coverage and compositional rigor over simple dataset size. PolyGen employs a Polylithic approach to train on the intersection of architecturally distinct generators, effectively marginalizing out model-specific artifacts. Additionally, we introduce a Programmatic Hard Negative curriculum that enforces fine-grained syntactic understanding. By structurally reallocating the same data budget from unique captions to multi-source variations, PolyGen achieves a more robust feature space, outperforming the leading single-source baseline (SynthCLIP) by +19.0% on aggregate multi-task benchmarks and on the SugarCrepe++ compositionality benchmark (+9.1%). These results demonstrate that structural diversity is a more data-efficient scaling law than simply increasing the volume of single-source samples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01382v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow matching models (FMs) have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) generation, with reinforcement learning (RL) serving as a critical post-training strategy for alignment with reward objectives. In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore.   Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training. Our extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that PromptRL consistently achieves higher performance ceilings while requiring over 2$\times$ fewer rollouts compared to naive flow-only RL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image-to-image relighting requires representations that disentangle scene properties from illumination. Recent methods rely on latent intrinsic representations but remain under-constrained and often fail on challenging materials such as metal and glass. A natural hypothesis is that stronger pretrained visual priors should resolve these failures. We find the opposite: features from top-performing semantic encoders often degrade relighting quality, revealing a fundamental trade-off between semantic abstraction and photometric fidelity. We study this trade-off and introduce Augmented Latent Intrinsics (ALI), which balances semantic context and dense photometric structure by fusing features from a pixel-aligned visual encoder into a latent-intrinsic framework, together with a self-supervised refinement strategy to mitigate the scarcity of paired real-world data. Trained only on unlabeled real-world image pairs and paired with a dense, pixel-aligned visual prior, ALI achieves strong improvements in relighting, with the largest gains on complex, specular materials.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01418v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Parabolic Position Encoding (PaPE), a parabola-based position encoding for vision modalities in attention-based architectures. Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding.

Existing forensic models, primarily trained on natural images, often underperform on biomedical data where subtle manipulations can compromise experimental validity. To address this, BioTamperNet introduces an affinity-guided self-attention module to capture intra-image similarities and an affinity-guided cross-attention module to model cross-image correspondences. Our design integrates lightweight SSM-inspired linear attention mechanisms to enable efficient, fine-grained localization. Trained end-to-end, BioTamperNet simultaneously identifies tampered regions and their source counterparts. Extensive experiments on the benchmark bio-forensic datasets demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines in accurately detecting duplicated regions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01452v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding where drivers direct their visual attention during driving, as characterized by gaze behavior, is critical for developing next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems and improving road safety. This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a "part-versus-whole" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01459v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision transformers have shown remarkable performance in vision tasks, but enabling them for accessible and real-time use is still challenging. Quantization reduces memory and inference costs at the risk of performance loss. Strides have been made to mitigate low precision issues mainly by understanding in-distribution (ID) task behaviour, but the attention mechanism may provide insight on quantization attributes by exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. We investigate the behaviour of quantized small-variant popular vision transformers (DeiT, DeiT3, and ViT) on common OOD datasets. ID analyses show the initial instabilities of 4-bit models, particularly of those trained on the larger ImageNet-22k, as the strongest FP32 model, DeiT3, sharply drop 17% from quantization error to be one of the weakest 4-bit models. While ViT shows reasonable quantization robustness for ID calibration, OOD detection reveals more: ViT and DeiT3 pretrained on ImageNet-22k respectively experienced a 15.0% and 19.2% average quantization delta in AUPR-out between full precision to 4-bit while their ImageNet-1k-only counterparts experienced a 9.5% and 12.0% delta. Overall, our results suggest pretraining on large scale datasets may hinder low-bit quantization robustness in OOD detection and that data augmentation may be a more beneficial option.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Logit Lens has been proposed for visualizing tokens that contribute most to LLM answers. Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word "cat"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online handwritten character recognition leverages stroke order and dynamic features, which generally provide higher accuracy and robustness compared with offline recognition. However, in practical applications, rotational deformations can disrupt the spatial layout of strokes, substantially reducing recognition accuracy. Extracting rotation-invariant features therefore remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we employ the Sliding Window Path Signature (SW-PS) to capture local structural features of characters, and introduce the lightweight Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) as the classifier. The LRU combine the fast incremental processing capability of recurrent neural networks (RNN) with the efficient parallel training of state space models (SSM), while reliably modelling dynamic stroke characteristics. We conducted recognition experiments with random rotation angle up to $\pm 180^{\circ}$ on three subsets of the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset: digits, English upper letters, and Chinese radicals. The accuracies achieved after ensemble learning were $99.62\%$, $96.67\%$, and $94.33\%$, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SW-PS+LRU framework consistently surpasses competing models in both convergence speed and test accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01538v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating talking avatars is a fundamental task in video generation. Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars. Project page: https://interactavatar.github.io

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01540v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Crowd counting plays a vital role in public safety, traffic regulation, and smart city management. However, despite the impressive progress achieved by CNN- and Transformer-based models, their performance often deteriorates when applied across diverse environments due to severe domain discrepancies. Direct joint training on multiple datasets, which intuitively should enhance generalization, instead results in negative transfer, as shared and domain-specific representations become entangled. To address this challenge, we propose the Feature Separation and Cross-Attention Network FSCA-Net, a unified framework that explicitly disentangles feature representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. A novel cross-attention fusion module adaptively models interactions between these components, ensuring effective knowledge transfer while preserving dataset-specific discriminability. Furthermore, a mutual information optimization objective is introduced to maximize consistency among domain-invariant features and minimize redundancy among domain-specific ones, promoting complementary shared-private representations. Extensive experiments on multiple crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that FSCA-Net effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-world crowd analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Capturing display screens with mobile devices has become increasingly common, yet the resulting images often suffer from severe degradations caused by the coexistence of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, leading to significant visual quality degradation. Due to the strong coupling of these two artifacts in real imaging processes, existing methods designed for single degradations fail to generalize to such compound scenarios. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on joint removal of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding in screen-captured images, and propose a unified restoration framework, named CLEAR. To support this task, we construct a large-scale dataset containing both moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, and introduce an ISP-based flicker simulation pipeline to stabilize model training and expand the degradation distribution. Furthermore, we design a frequency-domain decomposition and re-composition module together with a trajectory alignment loss to enhance the modeling of compound artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently. outperforms existing image restoration approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01561v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Commonsense reasoning in multimodal contexts remains a foundational challenge in artificial intelligence. We introduce Multimodal UNcommonsense(MUN), a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to handle scenarios that deviate from typical visual or contextual expectations. MUN pairs visual scenes with surprising or unlikely outcomes described in natural language, prompting models to either rationalize seemingly odd images using everyday logic or uncover unexpected interpretations in ordinary scenes. To support this task, we propose a retrieval-based in-context learning (R-ICL) framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from larger models to smaller ones without additional training. Leveraging a novel Multimodal Ensemble Retriever (MER), our method identifies semantically relevant exemplars even when image and text pairs are deliberately discordant. Experiments show an average improvement of 8.3% over baseline ICL methods, highlighting the effectiveness of R-ICL in low-frequency, atypical settings. MUN opens new directions for evaluating and improving visual-language models' robustness and adaptability in real-world, culturally diverse, and non-prototypical scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression methods have achieved notable progress, delivering high perceptual quality at low bitrates. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant inference latency and heavy computational overhead, primarily due to the large number of denoising steps required during decoding. To address this problem, we propose a diffusion-based image compression method that requires only a single-step diffusion process, significantly improving inference speed. To enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructed images, we introduce a discriminator that operates on compact feature representations instead of raw pixels, leveraging the fact that features better capture high-level texture and structural details. Experimental results show that our method delivers comparable compression performance while offering a 46$\times$ faster inference speed compared to recent diffusion-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are vulnerable to transfer-based adversarial perturbations, enabling attackers to optimize on surrogate models and manipulate black-box VLM outputs. Prior targeted transfer attacks often overfit surrogate-specific embedding space by relying on a single reference and emphasizing final-layer alignment, which underutilizes intermediate semantics and degrades transfer across heterogeneous VLMs. To address this, we propose SGHA-Attack, a Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment framework that adopts multiple target references and enforces intermediate-layer consistency. Concretely, we generate a visually grounded reference pool by sampling a frozen text-to-image model conditioned on the target prompt, and then carefully select the Top-K most semantically relevant anchors under the surrogate to form a weighted mixture for stable optimization guidance. Building on these anchors, SGHA-Attack injects target semantics throughout the feature hierarchy by aligning intermediate visual representations at both global and spatial granularities across multiple depths, and by synchronizing intermediate visual and textual features in a shared latent subspace to provide early cross-modal supervision before the final projection. Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial black-box VLMs show that SGHA-Attack achieves stronger targeted transferability than prior methods and remains robust under preprocessing and purification defenses.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01586v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation that involves accurate estimation of 3D human hand keypoint locations is crucial for many human-computer interaction applications such as augmented reality. However, this task poses significant challenges due to self-occlusion of the hands and occlusions caused by interactions with objects. In this paper, we propose HandMCM to address these challenges. Our HandMCM is a novel method based on the powerful state space model (Mamba). By incorporating modules for local information injection/filtering and correspondence modeling, the proposed correspondence Mamba effectively learns the highly dynamic kinematic topology of keypoints across various occlusion scenarios. Moreover, by integrating multi-modal image features, we enhance the robustness and representational capacity of the input, leading to more accurate hand pose estimation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving severe occlusions. These results highlight the potential of our approach to advance the accuracy and reliability of 3D hand pose estimation in practical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01591v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in flow matching models, particularly with reinforcement learning (RL), have significantly enhanced human preference alignment in few step text to image generators. However, existing RL based approaches for flow matching models typically rely on numerous denoising steps, while suffering from sparse and imprecise reward signals that often lead to suboptimal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences. The code and models of this work will be available to facilitate further research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01593v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing salient object detection (SOD) models are generally constrained by the limited receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and quadratic computational complexity of Transformers. Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the "task-specific" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model. Additional results further demonstrate the potential of our Samba framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01594v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) need to understand human driver behavior while perceiving their navigation context, but jointly learning these heterogeneous tasks would cause inter-task negative transfer and impair system performance. Here, we propose a Unified and Versatile Multimodal Multi-Task Learning (UV-M3TL) framework to simultaneously recognize driver behavior, driver emotion, vehicle behavior, and traffic context, while mitigating inter-task negative transfer. Our framework incorporates two core components: dual-branch spatial channel multimodal embedding (DB-SCME) and adaptive feature-decoupled multi-task loss (AFD-Loss). DB-SCME enhances cross-task knowledge transfer while mitigating task conflicts by employing a dual-branch structure to explicitly model salient task-shared and task-specific features. AFD-Loss improves the stability of joint optimization while guiding the model to learn diverse multi-task representations by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism based on learning dynamics and feature decoupling constraints. We evaluate our method on the AIDE dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that UV-M3TL achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four tasks. To further prove the versatility, we evaluate UV-M3TL on additional public multi-task perception benchmarks (BDD100K, CityScapes, NYUD-v2, and PASCAL-Context), where it consistently delivers strong performance across diverse task combinations, attaining state-of-the-art results on most tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-context generation significantly enhances Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by enabling controllable image-to-image generation through reference examples. However, the resulting input concatenation drastically increases sequence length, creating a substantial computational bottleneck. Existing token reduction techniques, primarily tailored for text-to-image synthesis, fall short in this paradigm as they apply uniform reduction strategies, overlooking the inherent role asymmetry between reference contexts and target latents across spatial, temporal, and functional dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToPi, a training-free token pruning framework tailored for in-context generation in DiTs. Specifically, ToPi utilizes offline calibration-driven sensitivity analysis to identify pivotal attention layers, serving as a robust proxy for redundancy estimation. Leveraging these layers, we derive a novel influence metric to quantify the contribution of each context token for selective pruning, coupled with a temporal update strategy that adapts to the evolving diffusion trajectory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ToPi can achieve over 30\% speedup in inference while maintaining structural fidelity and visual consistency across complex image generation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01624v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation aims to synthesize videos with high visual quality and temporal consistency that are semantically aligned with input text. Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01630v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models have emerged as a critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01633v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While deep learning models like Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved significant advances, they typically require large datasets. With data privacy regulations, access to many original datasets is restricted, especially medical images. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange. However, the heterogeneity of the data and the class imbalance that exist in local clients pose challenges for the generalization of the model. This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\% to 41.69\%. Ablation studies on the imbalanced ISIC dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function and aggregation strategy compared to traditional loss functions and other FL approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01639v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images based on a hybrid query comprising a reference image and a modification text. Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01649v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the redundancy of video tokens introduces significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment. Many compression algorithms are proposed to prioritize retaining features with the highest attention scores to minimize perturbations in attention computations. However, the correlation between attention scores and their actual contribution to correct answers remains ambiguous. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontribution-\textbf{a}ware token \textbf{Co}mpression algorithm for \textbf{VID}eo understanding (\textbf{CaCoVID}) that explicitly optimizes the token selection policy based on the contribution of tokens to correct predictions. First, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework that optimizes a policy network to select video token combinations with the greatest contribution to correct predictions. This paradigm shifts the focus from passive token preservation to active discovery of optimal compressed token combinations. Secondly, we propose a combinatorial policy optimization algorithm with online combination space sampling, which dramatically reduces the exploration space for video token combinations and accelerates the convergence speed of policy optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CaCoVID. Codes will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we focus on the challenge of temporally consistent human-centric dense prediction across video sequences. Existing models achieve strong per-frame accuracy but often flicker under motion, occlusion, and lighting changes, and they rarely have paired human video supervision for multiple dense tasks. We address this gap with a scalable synthetic data pipeline that generates photorealistic human frames and motion-aligned sequences with pixel-accurate depth, normals, and masks. Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning. Building on this, we train a unified ViT-based dense predictor that (i) injects an explicit human geometric prior via CSE embeddings and (ii) improves geometry-feature reliability with a lightweight channel reweighting module after feature fusion. Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences. Extensive experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.1 and Hi4D and generalize effectively to in-the-wild videos.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01673v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Loop closure detection (LCD) is a core component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): it identifies revisited places and enables pose-graph constraints that correct accumulated drift. Classic bag-of-words approaches such as DBoW are efficient but often degrade under appearance change and perceptual aliasing. In parallel, deep learning-based visual place recognition (VPR) descriptors (e.g., NetVLAD and Transformer-based models) offer stronger robustness, but their computational cost is often viewed as a barrier to real-time SLAM. In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches. With Faiss-accelerated nearestneighbor search, NetVLAD achieves real-time query speed while improving accuracy and robustness over DBoW, making it a practical drop-in alternative for LCD in SLAM.

The system adopts a parallel pipeline with a VR Frontend and a GA Backend. The VR Frontend uses inverse kinematics to estimate full-body pose and streams the resulting pose along with stereo camera parameters to the backend. The GA Backend stereoscopically renders a 3DGS avatar reconstructed from a single image. To improve stereo rendering efficiency, we introduce Binocular Batching, which jointly processes left and right eye views in a single batched pass to reduce redundant computation and support high-resolution VR displays. We evaluate VRGaussianAvatar with quantitative performance tests and a within-subject user study against image- and video-based mesh avatar baselines. Results show that VRGaussianAvatar sustains interactive VR performance and yields higher perceived appearance similarity, embodiment, and plausibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual tracking aims to automatically estimate the state of a target object in a video sequence, which is challenging especially in dynamic scenarios. Thus, numerous methods are proposed to introduce temporal cues to enhance tracking robustness. However, conventional CNN and Transformer architectures exhibit inherent limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies in visual tracking, often necessitating either complex customized modules or substantial computational costs to integrate temporal cues. Inspired by the success of the state space model, we propose a novel temporal modeling paradigm for visual tracking, termed State-aware Mamba Tracker (SMTrack), providing a neat pipeline for training and tracking without needing customized modules or substantial computational costs to build long-range temporal dependencies. It enjoys several merits. First, we propose a novel selective state-aware space model with state-wise parameters to capture more diverse temporal cues for robust tracking. Second, SMTrack facilitates long-range temporal interactions with linear computational complexity during training. Third, SMTrack enables each frame to interact with previously tracked frames via hidden state propagation and updating, which releases computational costs of handling temporal cues during tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SMTrack achieves promising performance with low computational costs.

However, existing methods lack flexible adaptivity, leading to irreversible detail loss and context fragmentation. To resolve this, we propose FreshMem, a Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory network inspired by the brain's logarithmic perception and memory consolidation. FreshMem reconciles short-term fidelity with long-term coherence through two synergistic modules: Multi-scale Frequency Memory (MFM), which projects overflowing frames into representative frequency coefficients, complemented by residual details to reconstruct a global historical "gist"; and Space Thumbnail Memory (STM), which discretizes the continuous stream into episodic clusters by employing an adaptive compression strategy to distill them into high-density space thumbnails. Extensive experiments show that FreshMem significantly boosts the Qwen2-VL baseline, yielding gains of 5.20%, 4.52%, and 2.34% on StreamingBench, OV-Bench, and OVO-Bench, respectively. As a training-free solution, FreshMem outperforms several fully fine-tuned methods, offering a highly efficient paradigm for long-horizon streaming video understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to 4D physical simulation remains challenging. Based on the Material Point Method (MPM), existing methods either rely on manual parameter tuning or distill dynamics from video diffusion models, limiting the generalization and optimization efficiency. Recent attempts using LLMs/VLMs suffer from a text/image-to-3D perceptual gap, yielding unstable physics behavior. In addition, they often ignore the surface structure of 3DGS, leading to implausible motion. We propose FastPhysGS, a fast and robust framework for physics-based dynamic 3DGS simulation:(1) Instance-aware Particle Filling (IPF) with Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCIS) to efficiently populate interior particles while preserving geometric fidelity; (2) Bidirectional Graph Decoupling Optimization (BGDO), an adaptive strategy that rapidly optimizes material parameters predicted from a VLM. Experiments show FastPhysGS achieves high-fidelity physical simulation in 1 minute using only 7 GB runtime memory, outperforming prior works with broad potential applications.

Specifically, the proposed hybrid architecture is based on DenVisCoM and a Transformer-based attention block that efficiently addresses real-time inference, memory footprint, and accuracy at the same time for joint estimation of motion and 3D dense perception tasks. We extensively analyze the benchmark trade-off of accuracy and real-time processing on a large number of datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-Generated Images (AIGI) achieve near-perfect accuracy on curated benchmarks, they suffer from a dramatic performance collapse in realistic, in-the-wild scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate that simplicity prevails over complex architectural designs. A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01741v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The burgeoning complexity and scale of 3D geometry models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference without retraining, conventional methods, primarily optimized for 2D Vision Transformers, fail to transfer effectively to 3D models due to intricate feature distributions and prohibitive calibration overhead. To address these challenges, we propose TAPTQ, a Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization pipeline specifically engineered for 3D geometric learning. Our contribution is threefold: (1) To overcome the data-scale bottleneck in 3D datasets, we develop a progressive coarse-to-fine calibration construction strategy that constructs a highly compact subset to achieve both statistical purity and geometric representativeness. (2) We reformulate the quantization interval search as an optimization problem and introduce a ternary-search-based solver, reducing the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ for accelerated deployment. (3) To mitigate quantization error accumulation, we propose TRE-Guided Module-wise Compensation, which utilizes a Tail Relative Error (TRE) metric to adaptively identify and rectify distortions in modules sensitive to long-tailed activation outliers. Extensive experiments on the VGGT and Pi3 benchmarks demonstrate that TAPTQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods in accuracy while significantly reducing calibration time. The code will be released soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01753v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is a fundamental challenge and a realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, a novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in a single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Smart parking systems help reduce congestion and minimize users' search time, thereby contributing to smart city adoption and enhancing urban mobility. In previous works, we presented a system developed on a university campus to monitor parking availability by estimating the number of free spaces from vehicle counts within a region of interest. Although this approach achieved good accuracy, it restricted the system's ability to provide spot-level insights and support more advanced applications. To overcome this limitation, we extend the system with a spot-wise monitoring strategy based on a distance-aware matching method with spatial tolerance, enhanced through an Adaptive Bounding Box Partitioning method for challenging spaces. The proposed approach achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.80% while maintaining an inference time of 8 seconds on a resource-constrained edge device, enhancing the capabilities of YOLOv11m, a model that has a size of 40.5 MB. In addition, two new components were introduced: (i) a Digital Shadow that visually represents parking lot entities as a base to evolve to a full Digital Twin, and (ii) an application support server based on a repurposed TV box. The latter not only enables scalable communication among cloud services, the parking totem, and a bot that provides detailed spot occupancy statistics, but also promotes hardware reuse as a step towards greater sustainability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01756v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While text-to-image generation has achieved unprecedented fidelity, the vast majority of existing models function fundamentally as static text-to-pixel decoders. Consequently, they often fail to grasp implicit user intentions. Although emerging unified understanding-generation models have improved intent comprehension, they still struggle to accomplish tasks involving complex knowledge reasoning within a single model. Moreover, constrained by static internal priors, these models remain unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Mind-Brush, a unified agentic framework that transforms generation into a dynamic, knowledge-driven workflow. Simulating a human-like 'think-research-create' paradigm, Mind-Brush actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-of-distribution concepts and employs reasoning tools to resolve implicit visual constraints. To rigorously evaluate these capabilities, we propose Mind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 500 distinct samples spanning real-time news, emerging concepts, and domains such as mathematical and Geo-Reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mind-Brush significantly enhances the capabilities of unified models, realizing a zero-to-one capability leap for the Qwen-Image baseline on Mind-Bench, while achieving superior results on established benchmarks like WISE and RISE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01760v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper focuses on a highly practical scenario: how to continue benefiting from the advantages of multi-modal image fusion under harsh conditions when only visible imaging sensors are available. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel concept of single-image fusion, which extends conventional data-level fusion to the knowledge level. Specifically, we develop MagicFuse, a novel single image fusion framework capable of deriving a comprehensive cross-spectral scene representation from a single low-quality visible image. MagicFuse first introduces an intra-spectral knowledge reinforcement branch and a cross-spectral knowledge generation branch based on the diffusion models. They mine scene information obscured in the visible spectrum and learn thermal radiation distribution patterns transferred to the infrared spectrum, respectively. Building on them, we design a multi-domain knowledge fusion branch that integrates the probabilistic noise from the diffusion streams of these two branches, from which a cross-spectral scene representation can be obtained through successive sampling. Then, we impose both visual and semantic constraints to ensure that this scene representation can satisfy human observation while supporting downstream semantic decision-making. Extensive experiments show that our MagicFuse achieves visual and semantic representation performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art fusion methods with multi-modal inputs, despite relying solely on a single degraded visible image.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01764v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The reliable detection of unauthorized individuals in safety-critical industrial indoor spaces is crucial to avoid plant shutdowns, property damage, and personal hazards. Conventional vision-based methods that use deep-learning approaches for person recognition provide image information but are sensitive to lighting and visibility conditions and often violate privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. Typically, detection systems based on deep learning require annotated data for training. Collecting and annotating such data, however, is highly time-consuming and due to manual treatments not necessarily error free. Therefore, this paper presents a privacy-compliant approach based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems LiDAR (MEMS-LiDAR), which exclusively captures anonymized 3D point clouds and avoids personal identification features. To compensate for the large amount of time required to record real LiDAR data and for post-processing and annotation, real recordings are augmented with synthetically generated scenes from the CARLA simulation framework. The results demonstrate that the hybrid data improves the average precision by 44 percentage points compared to a model trained exclusively with real data while reducing the manual annotation effort by 50 %. Thus, the proposed approach provides a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to purely real-data-based methods and systematically shows how synthetic LiDAR data can combine high performance in person detection with GDPR compliance in an industrial environment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01780v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models are essential for autonomous robotic planning. However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models. Codes will be available at https://github.com/HCPLabSYSU/DDP-WM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01783v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Characterisation of structural discontinuity sets in exposed rock faces of underground mine cavities is essential for assessing rock-mass stability, excavation safety, and operational efficiency. UAV and other mobile laser-scanning techniques provide efficient means of collecting point clouds from rock faces. However, the development of a robust and efficient approach for automatic characterisation of discontinuity sets in real-world scenarios, like fully enclosed rock faces in cavities, remains an open research problem. In this study, a new approach is proposed for automatic discontinuity set characterisation that uses a single-shot filtering strategy, an innovative cyclic orientation transformation scheme and a hierarchical clustering technique. The single-shot filtering step isolates planar regions while robustly suppressing noise and high-curvature artefacts in one pass using a signal-processing technique. To address the limitations of Cartesian clustering on polar orientation data, a cyclic orientation transformation scheme is developed, enabling accurate representation of dip angle and dip direction in Cartesian space. The transformed orientations are then characterised into sets using a hierarchical clustering technique, which handles varying density distributions and identifies clusters without requiring user-defined set numbers. The accuracy of the method is validated on real-world mine stope and against ground truth obtained using manually handpicked discontinuity planes identified with the Virtual Compass tool, as well as widely used automated structure mapping techniques. The proposed approach outperforms the other techniques by exhibiting the lowest mean absolute error in estimating discontinuity set orientations in real-world stope data with errors of 1.95{\deg} and 2.20{\deg} in nominal dip angle and dip direction, respectively, and dispersion errors lying below 3{\deg}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01799v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term satellite image time series (SITS) analysis in heterogeneous landscapes faces significant challenges, particularly in Mediterranean regions where complex spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and multi-decade environmental changes interact across different scales. This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01801v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01805v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training-free image editing has attracted increasing attention for its efficiency and independence from training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01812v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most of the deep learning based medical image registration algorithms focus on brain image registration tasks.Compared with brain registration, the chest CT registration has larger deformation, more complex background and region over-lap. In this paper, we propose a fast unsupervised deep learning method, LDRNet, for large deformation image registration of chest CT images. We first predict a coarse resolution registration field, then refine it from coarse to fine. We propose two innovative technical components: 1) a refine block that is used to refine the registration field in different resolutions, 2) a rigid block that is used to learn transformation matrix from high-level features. We train and evaluate our model on the private dataset and public dataset SegTHOR. We compare our performance with state-of-the-art traditional registration methods as well as deep learning registration models VoxelMorph, RCN, and LapIRN. The results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for large deformation images registration and is much faster.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in video generation; however, the high computational cost of the denoising process remains a major bottleneck. Existing approaches have shown promise in reducing the number of diffusion steps, but they often suffer from significant quality degradation when applied to video generation. We propose Guided Progressive Distillation (GPD), a framework that accelerates the diffusion process for fast and high-quality video generation. GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01816v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency on general-purpose vision-language benchmarks, reaching or even exceeding human-level performance. However, these evaluations typically rely on standard in-distribution data, leaving the robustness of MLLMs largely unexamined when faced with scenarios that defy common-sense priors. To address this gap, we introduce VIA-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to probe model performance on visual illusions and anomalies. It includes six core categories: color illusions, motion illusions, gestalt illusions, geometric and spatial illusions, general visual illusions, and visual anomalies. Through careful human-in-the-loop review, we construct over 1K high-quality question-answer pairs that require nuanced visual reasoning. Extensive evaluation of over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning-enhanced models, uncovers significant vulnerabilities. Notably, we find that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning offers negligible robustness, often yielding ``brittle mirages'' where the model's logic collapses under illusory stimuli. Our findings reveal a fundamental divergence between machine and human perception, suggesting that resolving such perceptual bottlenecks is critical for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. The benchmark data and code will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01836v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying ADAS and ADS across countries remains challenging due to differences in legislation, traffic infrastructure, and visual conventions, which introduce domain shifts that degrade perception performance. Traditional cross-country data collection relies on extensive on-road driving, making it costly and inefficient to identify representative locations. To address this, we propose a street-view-guided data acquisition strategy that leverages publicly available imagery to identify places of interest (POI). Two POI scoring methods are introduced: a KNN-based feature distance approach using a vision foundation model, and a visual-attribution approach using a vision-language model. To enable repeatable evaluation, we adopt a collect-detect protocol and construct a co-located dataset by pairing the Zenseact Open Dataset with Mapillary street-view images. Experiments on traffic sign detection, a task particularly sensitive to cross-country variations in sign appearance, show that our approach achieves performance comparable to random sampling while using only half of the target-domain data. We further provide cost estimations for full-country analysis, demonstrating that large-scale street-view processing remains economically feasible. These results highlight the potential of street-view-guided data acquisition for efficient and cost-effective cross-country model adaptation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is crucial for surveillance and early-warning, with deployments spanning both single-frame analysis and video-mode tracking. A practical solution should leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) to mitigate infrared data scarcity, while adopting a memory-attention-based temporal propagation framework that unifies single- and multi-frame inference. However, infrared small targets exhibit weak radiometric signals and limited semantic cues, which differ markedly from visible-spectrum imagery. This modality gap makes direct use of semantics-oriented VFMs and appearance-driven cross-frame association unreliable for IRSTD: hierarchical feature aggregation can submerge localized target peaks, and appearance-only memory attention becomes ambiguous, leading to spurious clutter associations. To address these challenges, we propose SPIRIT, a unified and VFM-compatible framework that adapts VFMs to IRSTD via lightweight physics-informed plug-ins. Spatially, PIFR refines features by approximating rank-sparsity decomposition to suppress structured background components and enhance sparse target-like signals. Temporally, PGMA injects history-derived soft spatial priors into memory cross-attention to constrain cross-frame association, enabling robust video detection while naturally reverting to single-frame inference when temporal context is absent. Experiments on multiple IRSTD benchmarks show consistent gains over VFM-based baselines and SOTA performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in simulating complex dynamic systems. However, existing methods require known physical properties as supervision or inputs, limiting their applicability under unknown conditions. To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01850v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has enabled a wide range of ubiquitous computing applications, yet its dominant clip classification paradigm cannot capture the rich temporal structure of real-world behaviors. This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01851v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent generative models have achieved remarkable progress in image editing. However, existing systems and benchmarks remain largely text-guided. In contrast, human communication is inherently multimodal, where visual instructions such as sketches efficiently convey spatial and structural intent. To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In multimodal misinformation, deception usually arises not just from pixel-level manipulations in an image, but from the semantic and contextual claim jointly expressed by the image-text pair. Yet most deepfake detectors, engineered to detect pixel-level forgeries, do not account for claim-level meaning, despite their growing integration in automated fact-checking (AFC) pipelines. This raises a central scientific and practical question: Do pixel-level detectors contribute useful signal for verifying image-text claims, or do they instead introduce misleading authenticity priors that undermine evidence-based reasoning? We provide the first systematic analysis of deepfake detectors in the context of multimodal misinformation detection. Using two complementary benchmarks, MMFakeBench and DGM4, we evaluate: (1) state-of-the-art image-only deepfake detectors, (2) an evidence-driven fact-checking system that performs tool-guided retrieval via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and engages in deliberative inference through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), and (3) a hybrid fact-checking system that injects detector outputs as auxiliary evidence. Results across both benchmark datasets show that deepfake detectors offer limited standalone value, achieving F1 scores in the range of 0.26-0.53 on MMFakeBench and 0.33-0.49 on DGM4, and that incorporating their predictions into fact-checking pipelines consistently reduces performance by 0.04-0.08 F1 due to non-causal authenticity assumptions. In contrast, the evidence-centric fact-checking system achieves the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of approximately 0.81 on MMFakeBench and 0.55 on DGM4. Overall, our findings demonstrate that multimodal claim verification is driven primarily by semantic understanding and external evidence, and that pixel-level artifact signals do not reliably enhance reasoning over real-world image-text misinformation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works have explored reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) to mitigate hallucinations in diffusion-based image restoration. A key challenge is that real-world degradations make correspondences between low-quality (LQ) inputs and reference (Ref) images unreliable, requiring adaptive control of reference usage. Existing methods either ignore LQ-Ref correlations or rely on brittle explicit matching, leading to over-reliance on misleading references or under-utilization of valuable cues. To address this, we propose Ada-RefSR, a single-step diffusion framework guided by a "Trust but Verify" principle: reference information is leveraged when reliable and suppressed otherwise. Its core component, Adaptive Implicit Correlation Gating (AICG), employs learnable summary tokens to distill dominant reference patterns and capture implicit correlations with LQ features. Integrated into the attention backbone, AICG provides lightweight, adaptive regulation of reference guidance, serving as a built-in safeguard against erroneous fusion. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that Ada-RefSR achieves a strong balance of fidelity, naturalness, and efficiency, while remaining robust under varying reference alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01881v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prevailing image representation methods, including explicit representations such as raster images and Gaussian primitives, as well as implicit representations such as latent images, either suffer from representation redundancy that leads to heavy manual editing effort, or lack a direct mapping from latent variables to semantic instances or parts, making fine-grained manipulation difficult. These limitations hinder efficient and controllable image and video editing. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical proxy-based parametric image representation that disentangles semantic, geometric, and textural attributes into independent and manipulable parameter spaces. Based on a semantic-aware decomposition of the input image, our representation constructs hierarchical proxy geometries through adaptive Bezier fitting and iterative internal region subdivision and meshing. Multi-scale implicit texture parameters are embedded into the resulting geometry-aware distributed proxy nodes, enabling continuous high-fidelity reconstruction in the pixel domain and instance- or part-independent semantic editing. In addition, we introduce a locality-adaptive feature indexing mechanism to ensure spatial texture coherence, which further supports high-quality background completion without relying on generative models. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing benchmarks, including ImageNet, OIR-Bench, and HumanEdit, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity with significantly fewer parameters, while enabling intuitive, interactive, and physically plausible manipulation. Moreover, by integrating proxy nodes with Position-Based Dynamics, our framework supports real-time physics-driven animation using lightweight implicit rendering, achieving superior temporal consistency and visual realism compared with generative approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are plagued by exorbitant inference costs attributable to the profusion of visual tokens within the vision encoder. The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) faces a fundamental conflict between semantic understanding and image reconstruction. High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy). Our results highlight STELLAR as a versatile sparse representation that bridges the gap between discriminative and generative vision by strategically separating semantic identity from spatial geometry.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01906v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a challenging task due to high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited labeled training samples. Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) is commonly used to undertake computational pathology (CPath) tasks, and the use of multi-scale patches allows diverse features across scales to be learned. Previous studies using multi-scale features in clinical applications rely on multiple inputs across magnifications with late feature fusion, which does not retain the link between features across scales while the inputs are dependent on arbitrary, manufacturer-defined magnifications, being inflexible and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose the Multi-scale Pyramidal Network (MSPN), which is plug-and-play over attention-based MIL that introduces progressive multi-scale analysis on WSI. Our MSPN consists of (1) grid-based remapping that uses high magnification features to derive coarse features and (2) the coarse guidance network (CGN) that learns coarse contexts. We benchmark MSPN as an add-on module to 4 attention-based frameworks using 4 clinically relevant tasks across 3 types of foundation model, as well as the pre-trained MIL framework. We show that MSPN consistently improves MIL across the compared configurations and tasks, while being lightweight and easy-to-use.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01954v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing commonly relies on text-only prompting to specify target categories, implicitly assuming that inference-time category queries can be reliably grounded through pretraining-induced text-visual alignment. In practice, this assumption often breaks down in remote sensing scenarios due to task- and application-specific category semantics, resulting in unstable category specification under open-vocabulary settings. To address this limitation, we propose RS-MPOD, a multimodal open-vocabulary detection framework that reformulates category specification beyond text-only prompting by incorporating instance-grounded visual prompts, textual prompts, and their multimodal integration. RS-MPOD introduces a visual prompt encoder to extract appearance-based category cues from exemplar instances, enabling text-free category specification, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate visual and textual information when both modalities are available. Extensive experiments on standard, cross-dataset, and fine-grained remote sensing benchmarks show that visual prompting yields more reliable category specification under semantic ambiguity and distribution shifts, while multimodal prompting provides a flexible alternative that remains competitive when textual semantics are well aligned.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite being trained on balanced datasets, existing AI-generated image detectors often exhibit systematic bias at test time, frequently misclassifying fake images as real. We hypothesize that this behavior stems from distributional shift in fake samples and implicit priors learned during training. Specifically, models tend to overfit to superficial artifacts that do not generalize well across different generation methods, leading to a misaligned decision threshold when faced with test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded post-hoc calibration framework based on Bayesian decision theory. In particular, we introduce a learnable scalar correction to the model's logits, optimized on a small validation set from the target distribution while keeping the backbone frozen. This parametric adjustment compensates for distributional shift in model output, realigning the decision boundary even without requiring ground-truth labels. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves robustness without retraining, offering a lightweight and principled solution for reliable and adaptive AI-generated image detection in the open world.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models emerged as a leading approach in text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and texture without optimization. Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02002v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models have demonstrated significant promise for data synthesis in autonomous driving. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniDriveDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both video and LiDAR generation, while also yielding measurable improvements in downstream

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02004v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models solve challenging visual problems via explicit long-chain inference: they gather visual clues from images and decode clues into textual tokens. Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\rightarrow$ outputs $\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions. Remarkably, \textbf{without any additional training}, ClueTracer improves all \textbf{reasoning} architectures (including \texttt{R1-OneVision}, \texttt{Ocean-R1}, \texttt{MM-Eureka}, \emph{etc}.) by $\mathbf{1.21\times}$ on reasoning benchmarks. When transferred to \textbf{non-reasoning} settings, it yields a $\mathbf{1.14\times}$ gain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent genomic foundation models largely adopt large language model architectures that treat DNA as a one-dimensional token sequence. However, exhaustive sequential reading is structurally misaligned with sparse and discontinuous genomic semantics, leading to wasted computation on low-information background and preventing understanding-driven compression for long contexts. Here, we present OpticalDNA, a vision-based framework that reframes genomic modeling as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-style document understanding. OpticalDNA renders DNA into structured visual layouts and trains an OCR-capable vision--language model with a \emph{visual DNA encoder} and a \emph{document decoder}, where the encoder produces compact, reconstructible visual tokens for high-fidelity compression. Building on this representation, OpticalDNA defines prompt-conditioned objectives over core genomic primitives-reading, region grounding, subsequence retrieval, and masked span completion-thereby learning layout-aware DNA representations that retain fine-grained genomic information under a reduced effective token budget. Across diverse genomic benchmarks, OpticalDNA consistently outperforms recent baselines; on sequences up to 450k bases, it achieves the best overall performance with nearly $20\times$ fewer effective tokens, and surpasses models with up to $985\times$ more activated parameters while tuning only 256k \emph{trainable} parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02033v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advertising image generation has increasingly focused on online metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), yet existing approaches adopt a ``one-size-fits-all" strategy that optimizes for overall CTR while neglecting preference diversity among user groups. This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings. Our code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/JD-GenX/OSMF.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a critical flaw in compositional reasoning, often confusing "a red cube and a blue sphere" with "a blue cube and a red sphere". Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., "a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., "In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel "Confusion Benchmark" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter. We release the Auto-Comp pipeline to facilitate future benchmark creation, alongside all our generated benchmarks (https://huggingface.co/AutoComp).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality, real-time rendering for bounded scenes, its extension to large-scale urban environments gives rise to critical challenges in terms of geometric consistency, memory efficiency, and computational scalability. To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.

We build our framework on the following key components: 1.) a new video autoencoder with highly-compressed latent space ($64\times64\times4$ spatial-temporal downsampling ratio), achieving competitive reconstruction quality; 2.) a diffusion transformer (DIT) architecture with a new layer memory design to enhance inter-layer information flow and context reuse within DIT, and 3.) a multi-resolution generation strategy via a few-step DIT upsampler to increase video fidelity. Our final model, which contains a 14B DIT base model and a 14B DIT upsampler, achieves competitive performance against other popular open-source models, while being an order of magnitude faster. We discuss our model design as well as training strategies in this report.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods often align feature information between teacher and student by exploring meaningful feature processing and loss functions. However, due to the difference in feature distributions between the teacher and student, the student model may learn incompatible information from the teacher. To address this problem, we propose teacher-guided student Diffusion Self-KD, dubbed as DSKD. Instead of the direct teacher-student alignment, we leverage the teacher classifier to guide the sampling process of denoising student features through a light-weight diffusion model. We then propose a novel locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-guided feature distillation method between the original and denoised student features. The denoised student features encapsulate teacher knowledge and could be regarded as a teacher role. In this way, our DSKD method could eliminate discrepancies in mapping manners and feature distributions between the teacher and student, while learning meaningful knowledge from the teacher. Experiments on visual recognition tasks demonstrate that DSKD significantly outperforms existing KD methods across various models and datasets. Our code is attached in supplementary material.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) is a diffusion-based framework designed to generate high-quality images conditioned on continuous regression labels. Although CCDM has demonstrated clear advantages over prior approaches across a range of datasets, it still exhibits notable limitations and has recently been surpassed by a GAN-based method, namely CcGAN-AVAR. These limitations mainly arise from its reliance on an outdated diffusion framework and its low sampling efficiency due to long sampling trajectories. To address these issues, we propose an improved CCDM framework, termed iCCDM, which incorporates the more advanced \textit{Elucidated Diffusion Model} (EDM) framework with substantial modifications to improve both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Specifically, iCCDM introduces a novel matrix-form EDM formulation together with an adaptive vicinal training strategy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, spanning image resolutions from $64\times64$ to $256\times256$, demonstrate that iCCDM consistently outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX.1, and Qwen-Image), achieving higher generation quality while significantly reducing sampling cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02123v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose MLV-Edit, a training-free, flow-based framework that address the unique challenges of minute-level video editing. While existing techniques excel in short-form video manipulation, scaling them to long-duration videos remains challenging due to prohibitive computational overhead and the difficulty of maintaining global temporal consistency across thousands of frames. To address this, MLV-Edit employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for segment-wise editing, facilitated by two core modules: Velocity Blend rectifies motion inconsistencies at segment boundaries by aligning the flow fields of adjacent chunks, eliminating flickering and boundary artifacts commonly observed in fragmented video processing; and Attention Sink anchors local segment features to global reference frames, effectively suppressing cumulative structural drift. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MLV-Edit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of temporal stability and semantic fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug-induced toxicity remains a leading cause of failure in preclinical development and early clinical trials. Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds. We optimize the thresholds using the mean of the false negative and false positive rates, resulting in only 0.16\% of pathological tissue classified as healthy and 0.35\% of healthy tissue classified as pathological. Applied to mouse liver WSIs with known toxicological findings, the framework accurately detects anomalies, including rare OOD morphologies. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-driven histopathology to support preclinical workflows, reduce late-stage failures, and improve efficiency in drug development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02130v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Supervised synthetic CT generation from CBCT requires registered training pairs, yet perfect registration between separately acquired scans remains unattainable. This registration bias propagates into trained models and corrupts standard evaluation metrics. This may suggest that superior benchmark performance indicates better reproduction of registration artifacts rather than anatomical fidelity. We propose physics-based CBCT simulation to provide geometrically aligned training pairs by construction, combined with evaluation using geometric alignment metrics against input CBCT rather than biased ground truth. On two independent pelvic datasets, models trained on synthetic data achieved superior geometric alignment (Normalized Mutual Information: 0.31 vs 0.22) despite lower conventional intensity scores. Intensity metrics showed inverted correlations with clinical assessment for deformably registered data, while Normalized Mutual Information consistently predicted observer preference across registration methodologies (rho = 0.31, p < 0.001). Clinical observers preferred synthetic-trained outputs in 87% of cases, demonstrating that geometric fidelity, not intensity agreement with biased ground truth, aligns with clinical requirements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02154v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prior to modern Earth observation technologies, historical maps provide a unique record of long-term urban transformation and offer a lens on the evolving identity of cities. However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02156v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width. The code is available at https://github.com/WenjieShu/LoopViT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers are widely adopted in modern vision models due to their strong ability to scale with dataset size and generalisability. However, this comes with a major drawback: computation scales quadratically to the total number of tokens. Numerous methods have been proposed to mitigate this. For example, we consider token pruning with reactivating tokens from preserved representations, but the increased computational efficiency of this method results in decreased stability from the preserved representations, leading to poorer dense prediction performance at deeper layers. In this work, we introduce Reg4Pru, a training regularisation technique that mitigates token-pruning performance loss for segmentation. We compare our models on the FIVES blood vessel segmentation dataset and find that Reg4Pru improves average precision by an absolute 46% compared to the same model trained without routing. This increase is observed using a configuration that achieves a 29% relative speedup in wall-clock time compared to the non-pruned baseline. These findings indicate that Reg4Pru is a valuable regulariser for token reduction strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02171v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The limited sample size and insufficient diversity of lung nodule CT datasets severely restrict the performance and generalization ability of detection models. Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02175v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To mitigate the threat of misinformation, multimodal manipulation localization has garnered growing attention. Consider that current methods rely on costly and time-consuming fine-grained annotations, such as patch/token-level annotations. This paper proposes a novel framework named Coupling Implicit and Explicit Cues (CIEC), which aims to achieve multimodal weakly-supervised manipulation localization for image-text pairs utilizing only coarse-grained image/sentence-level annotations. It comprises two branches, image-based and text-based weakly-supervised localization. For the former, we devise the Textual-guidance Refine Patch Selection (TRPS) module. It integrates forgery cues from both visual and textual perspectives to lock onto suspicious regions aided by spatial priors. Followed by the background silencing and spatial contrast constraints to suppress interference from irrelevant areas. For the latter, we devise the Visual-deviation Calibrated Token Grounding (VCTG) module. It focuses on meaningful content words and leverages relative visual bias to assist token localization. Followed by the asymmetric sparse and semantic consistency constraints to mitigate label noise and ensure reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our CIEC, yielding results comparable to fully supervised methods on several evaluation metrics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02185v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced VQA and now support Vision-DeepResearch systems that use search engines for complex visual-textual fact-finding. However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02186v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pulmonary trees extracted from CT images frequently exhibit topological incompleteness, such as missing or disconnected branches, which substantially degrades downstream anatomical analysis and limits the applicability of existing pulmonary tree modeling pipelines. Current approaches typically rely on dense volumetric processing or explicit graph reasoning, leading to limited efficiency and reduced robustness under realistic structural corruption. We propose TopoField, a topology-aware implicit modeling framework that treats topology repair as a first-class modeling problem and enables unified multi-task inference for pulmonary tree analysis. TopoField represents pulmonary anatomy using sparse surface and skeleton point clouds and learns a continuous implicit field that supports topology repair without relying on complete or explicit disconnection annotations, by training on synthetically introduced structural disruptions over \textit{already} incomplete trees. Building upon the repaired implicit representation, anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction are jointly inferred through task-specific implicit functions within a single forward pass.Extensive experiments on the Lung3D+ dataset demonstrate that TopoField consistently improves topological completeness and achieves accurate anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction under challenging incomplete scenarios. Owing to its implicit formulation, TopoField attains high computational efficiency, completing all tasks in just over one second per case, highlighting its practicality for large-scale and time-sensitive clinical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02193v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inverting real images into the noise space is essential for editing tasks using diffusion models, yet existing methods produce non-Gaussian noise with poor editability due to the inaccuracy in early noising steps. We identify the root cause: a mathematical singularity that renders inversion fundamentally ill-posed. We propose Singularity Skipping Inversion of Diffusion Models (SSI-DM), which bypasses this singular region by adding small noise before standard inversion. This simple approach produces inverted noise with natural Gaussian properties while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a plug-and-play technique compatible with general diffusion models, our method achieves superior performance on public image datasets for reconstruction and interpolation tasks, providing a principled and efficient solution to diffusion model inversion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant progress in Visual-Language-Action (VLA), in highly complex and dynamic environments that involve real-time unpredictable interactions (such as 3D open worlds and large-scale PvP games), existing approaches remain inefficient at extracting action-critical signals from redundant sensor streams. To tackle this, we introduce MAIN-VLA, a framework that explicitly Models the Abstraction of Intention and eNvironment to ground decision-making in deep semantic alignment rather than superficial pattern matching. Specifically, our Intention Abstraction (IA) extracts verbose linguistic instructions and their associated reasoning into compact, explicit semantic primitives, while the Environment Semantics Abstraction (ESA) projects overwhelming visual streams into a structured, topological affordance representation. Furthermore, aligning these two abstract modalities induces an emergent attention-concentration effect, enabling a parameter-free token-pruning strategy that filters out perceptual redundancy without degrading performance. Extensive experiments in open-world Minecraft and large-scale PvP environments (Game for Peace and Valorant) demonstrate that MAIN-VLA sets a new state-of-the-art, which achieves superior decision quality, stronger generalization, and cutting-edge inference efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\% in Instruction Following.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The relationships between objects and language are fundamental to meaningful communication between humans and AI, and to practically useful embodied intelligence. We introduce HieraNav, a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary goal navigation task where agents interpret natural language instructions to reach targets at four semantic levels: scene, room, region, and instance. To this end, we present Language as a Map (LangMap), a large-scale benchmark built on real-world 3D indoor scans with comprehensive human-verified annotations and tasks spanning these levels. LangMap provides region labels, discriminative region descriptions, discriminative instance descriptions covering 414 object categories, and over 18K navigation tasks. Each target features both concise and detailed descriptions, enabling evaluation across different instruction styles. LangMap achieves superior annotation quality, outperforming GOAT-Bench by 23.8% in discriminative accuracy using four times fewer words. Comprehensive evaluations of zero-shot and supervised models on LangMap reveal that richer context and memory improve success, while long-tailed, small, context-dependent, and distant goals, as well as multi-goal completion, remain challenging. HieraNav and LangMap establish a rigorous testbed for advancing language-driven embodied navigation. Project: https://bo-miao.github.io/LangMap

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-fidelity generative models have narrowed the perceptual gap between synthetic and real images, posing serious threats to media security. Most existing AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors rely on artifact-based classification and struggle to generalize to evolving generative traces. In contrast, human judgment relies on stable real-world regularities, with deviations from the human cognitive manifold serving as a more generalizable signal of forgery. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate AIGI detection as a Reference-Comparison problem that verifies consistency with the real-image manifold rather than fitting specific forgery cues. We propose MIRROR (Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR), a framework that explicitly encodes reality priors using a learnable discrete memory bank. MIRROR projects an input into a manifold-consistent ideal reference via sparse linear combination, and uses the resulting residuals as robust detection signals. To evaluate whether detectors reach the "superhuman crossover" required to replace human experts, we introduce the Human-AIGI benchmark, featuring a psychophysically curated human-imperceptible subset. Across 14 benchmarks, MIRROR consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving gains of 2.1% on six standard benchmarks and 8.1% on seven in-the-wild benchmarks. On Human-AIGI, MIRROR reaches 89.6% accuracy across 27 generators, surpassing both lay users and visual experts, and further approaching the human perceptual limit as pretrained backbones scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optical character recognition (OCR), which converts printed or handwritten text into machine-readable form, is widely used in assistive technology for people with blindness and low vision. Yet, most evaluations rely on static datasets that do not reflect the challenges of mobile use. In this study, we systematically evaluated OCR performance under both static and dynamic conditions. Static tests measured detection range across distances of 1-7 meters and viewing angles of 0-75 degrees horizontally. Dynamic tests examined the impact of motion by varying walking speed from slow (0.8 m/s) to very fast (1.8 m/s) and comparing three camera mounting positions: head-mounted, shoulder-mounted, and hand-held. We evaluated both a smartphone and smart glasses, using the phone's main and ultra-wide cameras. Four OCR engines were benchmarked to assess accuracy at different distances and viewing angles: Google Vision, PaddleOCR 3.0, EasyOCR, and Tesseract. PaddleOCR 3.0 was then used to evaluate accuracy at different walking speeds. Accuracy was computed at the character level using the Levenshtein ratio against manually defined ground truth. Results showed that recognition accuracy declined with increased walking speed and wider viewing angles. Google Vision achieved the highest overall accuracy, with PaddleOCR close behind as the strongest open-source alternative. Across devices, the phone's main camera achieved the highest accuracy, and a shoulder-mounted placement yielded the highest average among body positions; however, differences among shoulder, head, and hand were not statistically significant.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02227v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress, yet existing methods often lack the ability to dynamically reason and refine during generation--a hallmark of human creativity. Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\%$ on GenEval and $25\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\%$ and $11\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\%$ and token consumption by $51\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02232v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In autonomous driving scenarios, the collected LiDAR point clouds can be challenged by occlusion and long-range sparsity, limiting the perception of autonomous driving systems. Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds. LiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. Code: https://github.com/matteandre/LiFlow.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Occupancy prediction provides critical geometric and semantic understanding for robotics but faces efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Current dense methods suffer computational waste on empty voxels, while sparse query-based approaches lack robustness in diverse and complex indoor scenes. In this paper, we propose DiScene, a novel sparse query-based framework that leverages multi-level distillation to achieve efficient and robust occupancy prediction. In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUS{\dag}. With depth integration, DiScene{\dag} attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\times$ faster inference speed. Furthermore, experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and in-the-wild scenarios demonstrate the versatility of our approach in various environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human motion data is inherently rich and complex, containing both semantic content and subtle stylistic features that are challenging to model. We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer. Our approach is guided by the insight that content corresponds to coarse motion attributes while style captures the finer, expressive details. To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles. Our framework demonstrates strong versatility across multiple inference applications, including style transfer, style removal, and motion blending.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02341v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present LongVPO, a novel two-stage Direct Preference Optimization framework that enables short-context vision-language models to robustly understand ultra-long videos without any long-video annotations. In Stage 1, we synthesize preference triples by anchoring questions to individual short clips, interleaving them with distractors, and applying visual-similarity and question-specificity filtering to mitigate positional bias and ensure unambiguous supervision. We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding.

In this work, we explore how different neural networks can be designed as a new texture INR, which operates in a continuous manner rather than a discrete one over the input UV coordinate space. Through thorough experiments, we demonstrate that these INRs perform well in terms of image quality, with considerable memory usage and rendering inference time. We analyze the balance between these objectives. In addition, we investigate various related applications in real-time rendering and down-stream tasks, e.g. mipmap fitting and INR-space generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in inspecting the internal structures of industrial objects. Furthermore, achieving high-quality CT reconstruction from sparse views is essential for reducing production costs. While classic implicit neural networks have shown promising results for sparse reconstruction, they are unable to leverage shape priors of objects. Motivated by the observation that numerous industrial objects exhibit rectangular structures, we propose a novel \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{B}inning (\textbf{NAB}) method that effectively integrates rectangular priors into the reconstruction process. Specifically, our approach first maps coordinate space into a binned vector space. This mapping relies on an innovative binning mechanism based on differences between shifted hyperbolic tangent functions, with our extension enabling rotations around the input-plane normal vector. The resulting representations are then processed by a neural network to predict CT attenuation coefficients. This design enables end-to-end optimization of the encoding parameters -- including position, size, steepness, and rotation -- via gradient flow from the projection data, thus enhancing reconstruction accuracy. By adjusting the smoothness of the binning function, NAB can generalize to objects with more complex geometries. This research provides a new perspective on integrating shape priors into neural network-based reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAB achieves superior performance on two industrial datasets. It also maintains robust on medical datasets when the binning function is extended to more general expression. The code will be made available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02370v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate histopathologic interpretation is key for clinical decision-making; however, current deep learning models for digital pathology are often overconfident and poorly calibrated in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, which limit trust and clinical adoption. Safety-critical medical imaging workflows benefit from intrinsic uncertainty-aware properties that can accurately reject OOD input. We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology. SNGP has comparable in-distribution performance while significantly improving uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Thus, SNGP or related models offer a useful framework for uncertainty-aware classification in digital pathology, supporting safe deployment and building trust with pathologists.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02380v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imagine Alice has a specific image $x^\ast$ in her mind, say, the view of the street in which she grew up during her childhood. To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Infinite-World, a robust interactive world model capable of maintaining coherent visual memory over 1000+ frames in complex real-world environments. While existing world models can be efficiently optimized on synthetic data with perfect ground-truth, they lack an effective training paradigm for real-world videos due to noisy pose estimations and the scarcity of viewpoint revisits. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities. Extensive experiments, including objective metrics and user studies, demonstrate that Infinite-World achieves superior performance in visual quality, action controllability, and spatial consistency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02401v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human motion analysis tasks, such as temporal 3D pose estimation, motion prediction, and motion in-betweening, play an essential role in computer vision. However, current paradigms suffer from severe fragmentation. First, the field is split between ``perception'' models that understand motion from video but only output text, and ``generation'' models that cannot perceive from raw visual input. Second, generative MLLMs are often limited to single-frame, static poses using dense, parametric SMPL models, failing to handle temporal motion. Third, existing motion vocabularies are built from skeleton data alone, severing the link to the visual domain. To address these challenges, we introduce Superman, a unified framework that bridges visual perception with temporal, skeleton-based motion generation. Our solution is twofold. First, to overcome the modality disconnect, we propose a Vision-Guided Motion Tokenizer. Leveraging the natural geometric alignment between 3D skeletons and visual data, this module pioneers robust joint learning from both modalities, creating a unified, cross-modal motion vocabulary. Second, grounded in this motion language, a single, unified MLLM architecture is trained to handle all tasks. This module flexibly processes diverse, temporal inputs, unifying 3D skeleton pose estimation from video (perception) with skeleton-based motion prediction and in-betweening (generation). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, demonstrate that our unified method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all motion tasks. This showcases a more efficient and scalable path for generative motion analysis using skeletons.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors in large, pretrained models without altering unrelated behaviors. While some recent works have edited vision-language models (VLMs), no existing editors tackle reasoning-heavy tasks, which typically require humans and models to reason about images.We therefore propose ReasonEdit, the first VLM editor to let users explain their reasoning during editing, introducing a new, practical model editing setup. ReasonEdit continuously stores human reasoning in a codebook, and retrieves only relevant facts during inference using a novel topology-balanced multimodal embedding method inspired by network science. Across four VLMs on multiple rationale-based visual question answering datasets, ReasonEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance, ultimately showing that using human reasoning during editing greatly improves edit generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02409v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of deep neural networks. State-of-the-art post-hoc methods typically derive OOD scores from the output logits or penultimate feature vector obtained via global average pooling (GAP). We contend that this exclusive reliance on the logit or feature vector discards a rich, complementary signal: the raw channel-wise statistics of the pre-pooling feature map lost in GAP. In this paper, we introduce Catalyst, a post-hoc framework that exploits these under-explored signals. Catalyst computes an input-dependent scaling factor ($\gamma$) on-the-fly from these raw statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and maximum activation). This $\gamma$ is then fused with the existing baseline score, multiplicatively modulating it -- an ``elastic scaling'' -- to push the ID and OOD distributions further apart. We demonstrate Catalyst is a generalizable framework: it seamlessly integrates with logit-based methods (e.g., Energy, ReAct, SCALE) and also provides a significant boost to distance-based detectors like KNN. As a result, Catalyst achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, reducing the average False Positive Rate by 32.87 on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18), 27.94% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and 22.25% on ImageNet (ResNet-50). Our results highlight the untapped potential of pre-pooling statistics and demonstrate that Catalyst is complementary to existing OOD detection approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tropical forests harbor most of the planet's tree biodiversity and are critical to global ecological balance. Canopy trees in particular play a disproportionate role in carbon storage and functioning of these ecosystems. Studying canopy trees at scale requires accurate delineation of individual tree crowns, typically performed using high-resolution aerial imagery. Despite advances in transformer-based models for individual tree crown segmentation, performance remains low in most forests, especially tropical ones. To this end, we introduce SelvaMask, a new tropical dataset containing over 8,800 manually delineated tree crowns across three Neotropical forest sites in Panama, Brazil, and Ecuador. SelvaMask features comprehensive annotations, including an inter-annotator agreement evaluation, capturing the dense structure of tropical forests and highlighting the difficulty of the task. Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a modular detection-segmentation pipeline that adapts vision foundation models (VFMs), using domain-specific detection-prompter. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both zero-shot generalist models and fully supervised end-to-end methods in dense tropical forests. We validate these gains on external tropical and temperate datasets, demonstrating that SelvaMask serves as both a challenging benchmark and a key enabler for generalized forest monitoring. Our code and dataset will be released publicly.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02437v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps. To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through a dual reasoning paradigm. We formulate generation as world knowledge-enhanced planning to inject implicit constraints, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared representation, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for planning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual self-correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02471v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning based auto segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, but conventional models often produce anatomically implausible false positives, or hallucinations, in slices lacking target structures. We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices. These results indicate that detection-based gating enhances robustness and anatomical plausibility in automated segmentation applications, reducing hallucinated predictions without compromising segmentation quality in valid slices, and offers a promising approach for improving the reliability of clinical radiotherapy auto-contouring workflows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pixel diffusion generates images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the artifacts and bottlenecks introduced by VAEs in two-stage latent diffusion. However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/PixelGen.

The system combines semantic data retrieval, agentic reasoning for iterative code generation, and secure sandboxed execution that produces verifiable multimodal outputs. Evaluated on a 199-question benchmark covering both factual and unanswerable questions, across 430 City-of-Zurich datasets and 11 LLMs, OGD4All reaches 98% analytical correctness and 94% recall while reliably rejecting questions unsupported by available data, which minimizes hallucination risks. Statistical robustness tests, as well as expert feedback, show reliability and social relevance. The proposed approach shows how LLMs can provide explainable, multimodal access to public data, advancing trustworthy AI for open governance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a measurement framework for difficult-to-access contexts that uses indirect data traces, interpretable machine-learning models, and theory-guided triangulation to fill inaccessible measurement spaces. Many high-stakes systems of scientific and policy interest are difficult, if not impossible, to reach directly: dynamics of interest are unobservable, data are indirect and fragmented across sources, and ground truth is absent or concealed. In these settings, available data often do not support conventional strategies for analysis, such as statistical inference on a single authoritative data stream or model validation against labeled outcomes. To address this problem, we introduce a general framework for measurement in data regimes characterized by structurally missing or adversarial data. We propose combining multi-source triangulation with interpretable machine learning models. Rather than relying on accuracy against unobservable, unattainable ideal data, our framework seeks consistency across separate, partially informative models. This allows users to draw defensible conclusions about the state of the world based on cross-signal consistency or divergence from an expected state. Our framework provides an analytical workflow tailored to quantitative characterization in the absence of data sufficient for conventional statistical or causal inference. We demonstrate our approach and explicitly surface inferential limits through an empirical analysis of organizational growth and internal pressure dynamics in a clandestine militant organization, drawing on multiple observational signals that individually provide incomplete and biased views of the underlying process. The results show how triangulated, interpretable ML can recover substantively meaningful variation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hydrogen-based multi-energy systems (HMES) have emerged as a promising low-carbon and energy-efficient solution, as it can enable the coordinated operation of electricity, heating and cooling supply and demand to enhance operational flexibility, improve overall energy efficiency, and increase the share of renewable integration. However, the optimal operation of HMES remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-physics coupled dynamics of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) (consisting of electrolyters, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks) as well as the presence of multiple uncertainties from supply and demand. To address these challenges, this paper develops a comprehensive operational model for HMES that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics and multi-physics process of HESS. Moreover, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by integrating the emerging representation learning techniques, enabling substantially accelerated and improved policy optimization for spatially and temporally coupled complex networked systems, which is not provided by conventional DRL. Experimental studies based on real-world datasets show that the comprehensive model is crucial to ensure the safe and reliable of HESS. In addition, the proposed SR-DRL approaches demonstrate superior convergence rate and performance over conventional DRL counterparts in terms of reducing the operation cost of HMES and handling the system operating constraints. Finally, we provide some insights into the role of representation learning in DRL, speculating that it can reorganize the original state space into a well-structured and cluster-aware geometric representation, thereby smoothing and facilitating the learning process of DRL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), the foundation of generative AI systems like ChatGPT, are transforming many fields and applications, including multimedia, enabling more advanced content generation, analysis, and interaction. However, cloud-based LLM deployments face three key limitations: high computational and energy demands, privacy and reliability risks from remote processing, and recurring API costs. Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5, when augmented with the ELLMPEG framework, achieves an average command-generation accuracy of 78 % with zero recurring API cost, outperforming all other open-source models across both the FFmpeg and VVenC datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00030v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) requires rapid situational understanding, reliable decision support, and the ability to generalize across diverse and previously unseen disaster contexts. This work introduces an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to support the three canonical phases of disaster response: initial rescue, mid-term recovery, and long-term reconstruction. To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation. An agentic controller dynamically selects retrieval strategies (e.g., RAPTOR, ColBERT) through entropy-aware scene abstraction, enabling adaptive reasoning across heterogeneous inputs. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based post-training method injects experiential knowledge from past disasters, enhancing the models' capacity to support both expert and non-expert responders. Experiments on real disaster datasets demonstrate improved situational grounding, enhanced task decomposition accuracy, and superior usability for emergency operations. Incorporating recent advances in long-context RAG systems, agentic information retrieval, and contemporary emergency response AI, our system achieves substantial gains through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation with self-reasoning and multimodal chain-of-thought capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting in specialized domains is often constrained by limited data availability, where conventional models typically require large-scale datasets to effectively capture underlying temporal dynamics. To tackle this few-shot challenge, we propose LTSM-DIFF (Large-scale Temporal Sequential Memory with Diffusion), a novel learning framework that integrates the expressive power of large language models with the generative capability of diffusion models. Specifically, the LTSM module is fine-tuned and employed as a temporal memory mechanism, extracting rich sequential representations even under data-scarce conditions. These representations are then utilized as conditional guidance for a joint probability diffusion process, enabling refined modeling of complex temporal patterns. This design allows knowledge transfer from the language domain to time series tasks, substantially enhancing both generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that LTSM-DIFF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in data-rich scenarios, while also delivering significant improvements in few-shot forecasting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis under data scarcity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sycophancy, the tendency of language models to prioritize agreement with user preferences over principled reasoning, has been identified as a persistent alignment failure in English-language evaluations. However, it remains unclear whether such diagnostics generalize across languages and cultural contexts. We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]). Category-level analysis reveals that advice prompts exhibit the largest cross-lingual differences (20-25 percentage points), achieving statistical significance in two of four models. These findings indicate that alignment behaviors measured in English may not transfer uniformly across languages and that culturally grounded prompt framing plays a substantial role. We release all datasets and evaluation code to support replication and extension.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Edge learning facilitates ubiquitous intelligence by enabling model training and adaptation directly on data-generating devices, thereby mitigating privacy risks and communication latency. However, the high computational and energy overhead of on-device training hinders its deployment on battery-powered mobile systems with strict thermal and memory budgets. While prior research has extensively optimized model architectures for efficient inference, the training phase remains bottlenecked by the processing of massive, often redundant, local datasets. In this work, we propose a data-centric optimization framework that leverages dataset pruning to achieve resource-efficient edge learning. Unlike standard methods that process all available data, our approach constructs compact, highly informative training subsets via a lightweight, on-device importance evaluation. Specifically, we utilize average loss statistics derived from a truncated warm-up phase to rank sample importance, deterministically retaining only the most critical data points under a dynamic pruning ratio. This mechanism is model-agnostic and operates locally without inter-device communication. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves a near-linear reduction in training latency and energy consumption proportional to the pruning ratio, with negligible degradation in model accuracy. These results validate dataset pruning as a vital, complementary paradigm for enhancing the sustainability and scalability of learning on resource-constrained mobile edge devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) signifies a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive equipment management strategies in modern industrial systems. Conventional time-based maintenance schedules frequently engender superfluous expenditures and unanticipated equipment failures. In contrast, CBM utilizes real-time equipment condition data to enhance maintenance timing and optimize resource allocation. The present paper proposes a novel distributional reinforcement learning approach for multi-equipment CBM using Quantile Regression Deep Q-Networks (QR-DQN) with aging factor integration. The methodology employed in this study encompasses the concurrent administration of multiple pump units through three strategic scenarios. The implementation of safety-first, balanced, and cost-efficient approaches is imperative. Comprehensive experimental validation over 3,000 training episodes demonstrates significant performance improvements across all strategies. The Safety-First strategy demonstrates superior cost efficiency, with a return on investment (ROI) of 3.91, yielding 152\% better performance than alternatives while requiring only 31\% higher investment. The system exhibits 95.66\% operational stability and immediate applicability to industrial environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimizing discrete executable text such as prompts and code has recently been framed as a gradient-based process, effectively translating backpropagation concepts to the semantic space. However, existing methods predominantly operate as first-order optimizers akin to Stochastic Gradient Descent, which are suffering from slow convergence and instability because they neglect the semantic curvature of the optimization landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextBFGS, a second-order framework to implement a Quasi-Newton optimization method for discrete text. Unlike traditional memory-based approaches that retrieve similar textual instances, TextBFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix by retrieving Gradient-Operators from the memory of pre-learned successful trajectories. Specifically, given a textual gradient feedback, TextBFGS identifies historical correction patterns from the optimization knowledge base and tries to apply these abstract operators to the current variable. This mechanism enables a One-Pass Update, combining feedback generation and second-order correction into a single inference step. Empirical evaluations on code optimization across diverse domains (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that TextBFGS significantly outperforms first-order baselines. It achieves superior pass rates with fewer model calls and exhibits strong cross-task transferability, thus establishes a mathematically grounded paradigm for efficient, memory-aware text optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00062v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adopting large-scale AI models in enterprise information systems is often hindered by high training costs and long development cycles, posing a significant managerial challenge. The standard end-to-end backpropagation (BP) algorithm is a primary driver of modern AI, but it is also the source of inefficiency in training deep networks. This paper introduces a new training methodology, Supervised Contrastive Parallel Learning (SCPL), that addresses this issue by decoupling BP and transforming a long gradient flow into multiple short ones. This design enables the simultaneous computation of parameter gradients in different layers, achieving superior model parallelism and enhancing training throughput. Detailed experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model compared to BP, Early Exit, GPipe, and Associated Learning (AL), a state-of-the-art method for decoupling backpropagation. By mitigating a fundamental performance bottleneck, SCPL provides a practical pathway for organizations to develop and deploy advanced information systems more cost-effectively and with greater agility. The experimental code is released for reproducibility. https://github.com/minyaho/scpl/

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00063v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are widely used to interpret machine learning predictions by identifying minimal changes to input features that would alter a model's decision. However, most existing counterfactual methods have not been tested when model and data uncertainty change, resulting in explanations that may be unstable or invalid under real-world variability. In this work, we investigate the robustness of common combinations of machine learning models and counterfactual generation algorithms in the presence of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tabular datasets, we show that counterfactual explanations are highly sensitive to model uncertainty. In particular, we find that even small reductions in model accuracy - caused by increased noise or limited data - can lead to large variations in the generated counterfactuals on average and on individual instances. These findings underscore the need for uncertainty-aware explanation methods in domains such as finance and the social sciences.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be highly sensitive to structural noise, including spurious or missing edges caused by adversarial attacks or non-adversarial imperfections. Existing graph contrastive learning methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) to generate diverse views or purely spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve global structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often become dense and lack sufficient diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGCL, a robust graph contrastive learning framework via SVD-guided structural perturbation. SPGCL couples lightweight stochastic edge removal with an SVD-guided refinement step that can recover mistakenly removed informative edges and introduce semantically meaningful missing links while avoiding graph densification through sparse top-ranked edge selection and merging. By balancing edge removal and recovery rates, SPGCL explicitly controls structural discrepancy between views so that contrastive signals reflect semantic structural differences rather than edge-count gaps. We further incorporate a contrastive fusion module regularized by a global similarity constraint to better align the two views. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves robustness and accuracy of base GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning and structure learning methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal graphs are gaining increasing attention due to their rich representational power and wide applicability, yet they introduce substantial challenges arising from severe modality confusion. To address this issue, we propose NSG (Node Splitting Graph)-MoE, a multimodal graph learning framework that integrates a node-splitting and graph-rewiring mechanism with a structured Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. It explicitly decomposes each node into modality-specific components and assigns relation-aware experts to process heterogeneous message flows, thereby preserving structural information and multimodal semantics while mitigating the undesirable mixing effects commonly observed in general-purpose GNNs. Extensive experiments on three multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that NSG-MoE consistently surpasses strong baselines. Despite incorporating MoE -- which is typically computationally heavy -- our method achieves competitive training efficiency. Beyond empirical results, we provide a spectral analysis revealing that NSG performs adaptive filtering over modality-specific subspaces, thus explaining its disentangling behavior. Furthermore, an information-theoretic analysis shows that the architectural constraints imposed by NSG reduces mutual information between data and parameters and improving generalization capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00072v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The performance of machine learning surrogates is critically dependent on data quality and quantity. This presents a major challenge, as high-fidelity (HF) data is often scarce and computationally expensive to acquire, while low-fidelity (LF) data is abundant but less accurate. To address this data scarcity problem, we develop a probabilistic multi-fidelity surrogate framework based on generative transfer learning. We employ a normalizing flow (NF) generative model as the backbone, which is trained in two phases: (i) the NF is first pretrained on a large LF dataset to learn a probabilistic forward model; (ii) the pretrained model is then fine-tuned on a small HF dataset, allowing it to correct for LF-HF discrepancies via knowledge transfer. To relax the dimension-preserving constraint of standard bijective NFs, we integrate surjective (dimension-reducing) layers with standard coupling blocks. This architecture enables learned dimension reduction while preserving the ability to train with exact likelihoods. The resulting surrogate provides fast probabilistic predictions with quantified uncertainty and significantly outperforms LF-only baselines while using fewer HF evaluations. We validate the approach on a reinforced concrete slab benchmark, combining many coarse-mesh (LF) simulations with a limited set of fine-mesh (HF) simulations. The proposed model achieves probabilistic predictions with HF accuracy, demonstrating a practical path toward data-efficient, generative AI-driven surrogates for complex engineering systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods are commonly used to identify local optima in high-dimensional spaces. When derivatives cannot be evaluated directly, stochastic estimators can provide approximate gradients. However, these estimators' perturbation-based sampling of the objective function introduces variance that can lead to slow convergence. In this paper, we present dimensional peeking, a variance reduction method for gradient estimation in discrete optimization via simulation. By lifting the sampling granularity from scalar values to classes of values that follow the same control flow path, we increase the information gathered per simulation evaluation. Our derivation from an established smoothed gradient estimator shows that the method does not introduce any bias. We present an implementation via a custom numerical data type to transparently carry out dimensional peeking over C++ programs. Variance reductions by factors of up to 7.9 are observed for three simulation-based optimization problems with high-dimensional input. The optimization progress compared to three meta-heuristics shows that dimensional peeking increases the competitiveness of zeroth-order optimization for discrete and non-convex simulations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper describes a methodology for automated univariate time series forecasting using regression trees and their ensembles: bagging and random forests. The key aspects that are addressed are: the use of an autoregressive approach and recursive forecasts, how to select the autoregressive features, how to deal with trending series and how to cope with seasonal behavior. Experimental results show a forecast accuracy comparable with well-established statistical models such as exponential smoothing or ARIMA. Furthermore, a publicly available software implementing all the proposed strategies has been developed and is described in the paper.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00079v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a lossless compression method for unit-norm embeddings that achieves 1.5$\times$ compression, 25\% better than the best prior method. The method exploits that spherical coordinates of high-dimensional unit vectors concentrate around $\pi/2$, causing IEEE 754 exponents to collapse to a single value and enabling entropy coding. Evaluation across 26 configurations spanning text, image, and multi-vector embeddings confirms consistent improvement. The method requires no training and is fully lossless within float32 precision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00084v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have become the dominant paradigm for adapting large pretrained models. We present a theoretical framework explaining an underexplored property: LoRA's inherent resistance to label noise. Our analysis reveals three key insights. First, we prove that rank-$r$ LoRA cannot memorize all possible label assignments once the sample size exceeds $O(r(d+k-r))$, limiting its capacity to fit arbitrary noise. Second, we derive an optimal rank balancing approximation bias and noise-induced variance, showing it decreases with noise rate. Third, we establish temporal separation: clean patterns are learned early while noise memorization occurs later. We propose RACT (Rank-Aware Curriculum Training), leveraging rank discrepancy for noise detection. Experiments validate our predictions, with RACT achieving 91.1% F1 for noise detection on AG News while maintaining 91.46% accuracy, competitive with baselines that lack noise detection capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00085v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, we identify a critical trade-off: while unconstrained RFT achieves strong reasoning performance, it severely compromises model trustworthiness by amplifying hallucination and worsening calibration; conversely, RKL-constrained RFT preserves trustworthiness but limits reasoning gains due to its unbounded penalty on exploratory deviations. To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration. Extensive experiments across multiple model scales and RFT algorithms show that CARE-RFT achieves a superior balance, matching the reasoning performance of unconstrained RFT while recovering the trustworthiness and calibration of the base model. Our work establishes that careful, confidence-aware regularization is key to building both capable and trustworthy reasoning models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning faces a dichotomy between traditional black-box search methods, which lack semantic guidance, and recent Large Language Model (LLM) approaches, which often suffer from superficial pattern matching and causal opacity. In this paper, we introduce ECCO, a framework that bridges interpretable reasoning with combinatorial search. We first propose a reverse engineering methodology to construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset, explicitly mapping static code features to verifiable performance evidence. This enables the model to learn the causal logic governing optimization decisions rather than merely imitating sequences. Leveraging this interpretable prior, we design a collaborative inference mechanism where the LLM functions as a strategist, defining optimization intents that dynamically guide the mutation operations of a genetic algorithm. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate that ECCO significantly outperforms the LLVM opt -O3 baseline, achieving an average 24.44% reduction in cycles.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in time series prediction tasks, but their substantial computational and memory requirements limit deployment on lightweight platforms. In this paper, we propose the Symbolic Transition Mechanism (STM) a novel framework that bridges numeric time series data and language models through symbolic abstraction and prompt engineering. STM transforms continuous time series values into symbol tokens with quantization techniques based on human cognitive structures, and captures temporal dynamics through structured transformations of symbols, enabling fast engineering based predictions in which language models focus on critical parts of time series data. STM is a general purpose mechanisms that ensure the integrity of backbone language models, but they significantly improve their efficiency by inferring the dynamic and structured patterns inherent in time series data. We evaluated STM on various time series datasets, paired with four small language models (SLM) with limited computational environments. For all models, STM achieves error reductions of up to 69% in MAE and 90% in MSE compared to the default backbone SLM without STM. These results demonstrate the potential of STM as an efficient, adaptable layer for symbol-driven time series prediction using foundation models. The accuracy improvements were made at negligible resource costs, with maximum GPU memory of the base model increasing by approximately 0.06% and latency overhead increasing by only 0.64%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a black-box interpretability framework that learns a verifiable constitution: a natural language summary of how changes to a prompt affect a model's specific behavior, such as its alignment, correctness, or adherence to constraints. Our method leverages atomic concept edits (ACEs), which are targeted operations that add, remove, or replace an interpretable concept in the input prompt. By systematically applying ACEs and observing the resulting effects on model behavior across various tasks, our framework learns a causal mapping from edits to predictable outcomes. This learned constitution provides deep, generalizable insights into the model. Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected. Moreover, our results show that the learned constitutions are highly effective for controlling model behavior, achieving an average of 1.86 times boost in success rate over methods that do not use constitutions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00094v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has become a central concern in computational decision-making systems, where ensuring equitable outcomes is essential for both ethical and legal reasons. Two dominant notions of fairness have emerged in the literature: Group Fairness (GF), which focuses on mitigating disparities across demographic subpopulations, and Individual Fairness (IF), which emphasizes consistent treatment of similar individuals. These notions have traditionally been studied in isolation. In contrast, this survey examines methods that jointly address GF and IF, integrating both perspectives within unified frameworks and explicitly characterizing the trade-offs between them. We provide a systematic and critical review of hybrid fairness approaches, organizing existing methods according to the fairness mechanisms they employ and the algorithmic and mathematical strategies used to reconcile multiple fairness criteria. For each class of methods, we examine their theoretical foundations, optimization mechanisms, and empirical evaluation practices, and discuss their limitations. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and identify open research directions for developing principled, context-aware hybrid fairness methods. By synthesizing insights across the literature, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to design hybrid algorithms that provide reliable fairness guarantees at both the individual and group levels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00099v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We explore the use of the Gauss-Newton method for optimization in shape learning, including implicit neural surfaces and geometry-informed neural networks. The method addresses key challenges in shape learning, such as the ill-conditioning of the underlying differential constraints and the mismatch between the optimization problem in parameter space and the function space where the problem is naturally posed. This leads to significantly faster and more stable convergence than standard first-order methods, while also requiring far fewer iterations. Experiments across benchmark shape optimization tasks demonstrate that the Gauss-Newton method consistently improves both training speed and final solution accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) offers lightweight learning for energy-constrained devices by encoding data into high-dimensional vectors. However, its reliance on ultra-high dimensionality and static, randomly initialized hypervectors limits memory efficiency and learning capacity. Therefore, we propose Trainable Hyperdimensional Computing (THDC), which enables end-to-end HDC via backpropagation. THDC replaces randomly initialized vectors with trainable embeddings and introduces a one-layer binary neural network to optimize class representations. Evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, THDC achieves equal or better accuracy than state-of-the-art HDC, with dimensionality reduced from 10.000 to 64.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mortgage default prediction is a core task in financial risk management, and machine learning models are increasingly used to estimate default probabilities and provide interpretable signals for downstream decisions. In real-world mortgage datasets, however, three factors frequently undermine evaluation validity and deployment reliability: ambiguity in default labeling, severe class imbalance, and information leakage arising from temporal structure and post-event variables. We compare multiple machine learning approaches for mortgage default prediction using a real-world loan-level dataset, with emphasis on leakage control and imbalance handling. We employ leakage-aware feature selection, a strict temporal split that constrains both origination and reporting periods, and controlled downsampling of the majority class. Across multiple positive-to-negative ratios, performance remains stable, and an AutoML approach (AutoGluon) achieves the strongest AUROC among the models evaluated. An extended and pedagogical version of this work will appear as a book chapter.

MiniTensor exposes a familiar PyTorch-like Python API while it executes performance critical code in a Rust engine. The core supports dense $n$ dimensional tensors, broadcasting, reductions, matrix multiplication, reverse mode automatic differentiation, a compact set of neural network layers, and standard optimizers. In this paper, we describe the design of MiniTensor's architecture, including its efficient memory management, dynamic computation graph for gradients, and integration with Python via PyO3. We also compare the install footprint with PyTorch and TensorFlow to demonstrate that MiniTensor achieves a package size of only a few megabytes, several orders of magnitude smaller than mainstream frameworks, while preserving the essentials needed for research and development on CPUs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs often underperform on complex reasoning tasks when relying on a single generation-and-selection pipeline. Inference-time ensemble methods can improve performance by sampling diverse reasoning paths or aggregating multiple candidate answers, but they typically treat candidates independently and provide no formal guarantees that ensembling improves reasoning quality. We propose a novel method, Aligned Delegation for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning (ALIGN), which formulates LLM reasoning as an aligned delegation game. In ALIGN, a principal delegates a task to multiple agents that generate candidate solutions under designed incentives, and then selects among their outputs to produce a final answer. This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under a fair comparison with equal access to candidate solutions, ALIGN provably improves expected performance over single-agent generation. Our analysis accommodates correlated candidate answers and relaxes independence assumptions that are commonly used in prior work. Empirical results across a broad range of LLM reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate that ALIGN outperforms strong single-agent and ensemble baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With increasing life expectancy, AD has become a major global health concern. While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters. The results indicate that the proposed QBPM architecture represents an innovative and powerful approach for the classification of stages in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated program repair with large language models remains challenging at the repository level due to long-horizon reasoning requirements and the limitations of autoregressive decoding. We present CodePilot, a hybrid framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large language models to enable execution-guided program repair for real-world GitHub issues. CodePilot performs hierarchical fault localization from repository to file and function level, explores diverse patch trajectories using MCTS, and leverages execution feedback as a reward signal to guide search and refinement. The framework further incorporates confidence-calibrated generation to selectively refine low-confidence outputs. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite demonstrate that CodePilot achieves a 24.67% issue resolution rate using open-weight models, outperforming comparable baselines. These results suggest that combining symbolic search with neural language models is an effective strategy for scalable, execution-aware software engineering automation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00130v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate the relationship between representation geometry and neural network performance. Analyzing 52 pretrained ImageNet models across 13 architecture families, we show that effective dimension -- an unsupervised geometric metric -- strongly predicts accuracy. Output effective dimension achieves partial r=0.75 ($p < 10^(-10)$) after controlling for model capacity, while total compression achieves partial r=-0.72. These findings replicate across ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and generalize to NLP: effective dimension predicts performance for 8 encoder models on SST-2/MNLI and 15 decoder-only LLMs on AG News (r=0.69, p=0.004), while model size does not (r=0.07). We establish bidirectional causality: degrading geometry via noise causes accuracy loss (r=-0.94, $p < 10^(-9)$), while improving geometry via PCA maintains accuracy across architectures (-0.03pp at 95% variance). This relationship is noise-type agnostic -- Gaussian, Uniform, Dropout, and Salt-and-pepper noise all show $|r| > 0.90$. These results establish that effective dimension provides domain-agnostic predictive and causal information about neural network performance, computed entirely without labels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Probing studies what information is encoded in a frozen LLM's layer representations by training a lightweight predictor on top of them. Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00161v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Compressing resource-intensive large language models by removing whole transformer blocks is a seemingly simple idea, but identifying which blocks to remove constitutes an exponentially difficult combinatorial problem. In this paper, we formulate block removal as a constrained binary optimization problem that can be mapped to a physical system (Ising model), whose energies are a strong proxy for downstream model performance. This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture. We illustrate this generality on the recent NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8 model, which exhibits a highly inhomogeneous and challenging block structure.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00165v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) intensifies the need for effective compression, with weight quantization being the most widely adopted technique. Standard uniform quantizers assume that parameters are evenly distributed, an assumption at odds with the highly skewed distributions observed in practice. We propose Benford-Quant, a simple, data-free non-uniform quantizer inspired by Benford's Law, which predicts that leading digits follow a logarithmic distribution. Benford-Quant replaces the uniform grid with a log-spaced codebook, dedicating more resolution to the frequent small-magnitude weights. We provide both theoretical intuition and empirical evidence: (i) weights in transformer transformational layers adhere closely to Benford statistics, while normalization layers systematically deviate; (ii) on Small Language Models (SLMs), Benford-Quant consistently improves perplexity, reducing 4-bit perplexity on Gemma-270M by more than 10%; and (iii) on larger LLMs, it remains competitive, with differences explained by over-parameterization effects. Our results indicate that incorporating a Benford-inspired prior into quantization grids is a low-cost modification that yields accuracy gains in aggressive few-bit regimes. Although it is not able to surpass the state of the art in tasks such as perplexity and LAMBADA, the Benford-Quant approach can be hybridized with other quantization methods-such as SmoothQuant and Activation-Aware Quantization-without major pipeline modification, potentially improving their performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00166v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Locally deployed Small Language Models (SLMs) must continually support diverse tasks under strict memory and computation constraints, making selective reliance on cloud Large Language Models (LLMs) unavoidable. Regulating cloud assistance during continual learning is challenging, as naive reward-based reinforcement learning often yields unstable offloading behavior and exacerbates catastrophic forgetting as task distributions shift. We propose DA-GRPO, a dual-advantage extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization that incorporates cloud-usage constraints directly into advantage computation, avoiding fixed reward shaping and external routing models. This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that DA-GRPO improves post-switch accuracy, substantially reduces forgetting, and maintains stable cloud usage compared to prior collaborative and routing-based approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weight-perturbation evolution strategies (ES) can fine-tune billion-parameter language models with surprisingly small populations (e.g., $N\!\approx\!30$), contradicting classical zeroth-order curse-of-dimensionality intuition. We also observe a second seemingly separate phenomenon: under fixed hyperparameters, the stochastic fine-tuning reward often rises, peaks, and then degrades in both ES and GRPO. We argue that both effects reflect a shared geometric property of fine-tuning landscapes: they are low-dimensional in curvature. A small set of high-curvature dimensions dominates improvement, producing (i) heterogeneous time scales that yield rise-then-decay under fixed stochasticity, as captured by a minimal quadratic stochastic-ascent model, and (ii) degenerate improving updates, where many random perturbations share similar components along these directions. Using ES as a geometric probe on fine-tuning reward landscapes of GSM8K, ARC-C, and WinoGrande across Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B--7B), we show that reward-improving perturbations remain empirically accessible with small populations across scales. Together, these results reconcile ES scalability with non-monotonic training dynamics and suggest that high-dimensional fine-tuning may admit a broader class of viable optimization methods than worst-case theory implies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) produces strong reasoning models, yet they can fail catastrophically when the conditioning context is fallible (e.g., corrupted chain-of-thought, misleading partial solutions, or mild input perturbations), since standard RLVR optimizes final-answer correctness only under clean conditioning. We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities. Across four open-weight models (1.5B--8B), GASP transforms strong-but-brittle reasoners into robust ones that withstand misleading and perturbed context while often improving clean accuracy. Further analysis shows that adversarial corruptions induce an effective curriculum, and in-distribution guidance enables rapid recovery learning with minimal representational drift.

Unlearning partially disrupts the mapping between linguistic symbols and the underlying knowledge, which remains intact as dormant memories. We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used unlearning techniques demonstrate that IVO achieves superior attack success rates and strong semantic consistency, exposing fundamental flaws in current defenses.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00179v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: For applications of machine learning in critical decisions, explainability is a primary concern, and often a regulatory requirement. Local linear methods for generating explanations, such as LIME and SHAP, have been criticized for being unstable near decision boundaries. In this paper, we explain that such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of the problem. The forecast uncertainty is high at decision boundaries, so consequently, the explanatory instability is high. The correct approach is to change the sequence of events and questions being asked. Nonlinear models can be highly predictive in some regions while having little or no predictability in others. Therefore, the first question is whether a usable forecast exists. When there is a forecast with low enough uncertainty to be useful, an explanation can be sought via a local linear approximation. In such cases, the explanatory instability is correspondingly low. When no usable forecast exists, the decision must fall to a simpler overall model such as traditional logistic regression. Additionally, these results show that some methods that purport to be explainable everywhere, such as ReLU networks or any piecewise linear model, have only an illusory explainability, because the forecast uncertainty at the segment boundaries is too high to be useful. Explaining an unusable forecast is pointless.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00191v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models learn a time-indexed score field $\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$ that often inherits approximate equivariances (flips, rotations, circular shifts) from in-distribution (ID) data and convolutional backbones. Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern generative models can produce realistic samples, however, balancing memorisation and generalisation remains an open problem. We approach this challenge from a Bayesian perspective by focusing on the parameter space of flow matching and diffusion models and constructing a predictive posterior that better captures the variability of the data distribution. In particular, we capture the geometry of the loss using a Riemannian metric and leverage a flexible approximate posterior that adapts to the local structure of the loss landscape. This approach allows us to sample generative models that resemble the original model, but exhibit reduced memorisation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces memorisation while preserving generalisation. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method, which explains our findings. Overall, our work illustrates how considering the geometry of the loss enables effective use of the parameter space, even for complex high-dimensional generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks often exhibit substantial disparities in class-wise accuracy, even when trained on class-balanced data, posing concerns for reliable deployment. While prior efforts have explored empirical remedies, a theoretical understanding of such performance disparities in classification remains limited. In this work, we present Margin Regularization for Performance Disparity Reduction (MR$^2$), a theoretically principled regularization for classification by dynamically adjusting margins in both the logit and representation spaces. Our analysis establishes a margin-based, class-sensitive generalization bound that reveals how per-class feature variability contributes to error, motivating the use of larger margins for hard classes. Guided by this insight, MR$^2$ optimizes per-class logit margins proportional to feature spread and penalizes excessive representation margins to enhance intra-class compactness. Experiments on seven datasets, including ImageNet, and diverse pre-trained backbones (MAE, MoCov2, CLIP) demonstrate that MR$^2$ not only improves overall accuracy but also significantly boosts hard class performance without trading off easy classes, thus reducing performance disparity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00208v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity of data distributions and the lack of labels. Ensemble methods are often adopted to mitigate these challenges by combining multiple detectors, which can reduce individual biases and increase robustness. Yet building an ensemble that is genuinely complementary remains challenging, since many detectors rely on similar decision cues and end up producing redundant anomaly scores. As a result, the potential of ensemble learning is often limited by the difficulty of identifying models that truly capture different types of irregularities. To address this, we propose a methodology for characterizing anomaly detectors through their decision mechanisms. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we quantify how each model attributes importance to input features, and we use these attribution profiles to measure similarity between detectors. We show that detectors with similar explanations tend to produce correlated anomaly scores and identify largely overlapping anomalies. Conversely, explanation divergence reliably indicates complementary detection behavior. Our results demonstrate that explanation-driven metrics offer a different criterion than raw outputs for selecting models in an ensemble. However, we also demonstrate that diversity alone is insufficient; high individual model performance remains a prerequisite for effective ensembles. By explicitly targeting explanation diversity while maintaining model quality, we are able to construct ensembles that are more diverse, more complementary, and ultimately more effective for unsupervised anomaly detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through ever-increasing parameter counts, but scaling incurs steep computational costs. To better understand LLM scaling, we study representational differences between LLMs and their smaller counterparts, with the goal of replicating the representational qualities of larger models in the smaller models. We observe a geometric phenomenon which we term $\textbf{embedding condensation}$, where token embeddings collapse into a narrow cone-like subspace in some language models. Through systematic analyses across multiple Transformer families, we show that small models such as $\texttt{GPT2}$ and $\texttt{Qwen3-0.6B}$ exhibit severe condensation, whereas the larger models such as $\texttt{GPT2-xl}$ and $\texttt{Qwen3-32B}$ are more resistant to this phenomenon. Additional observations show that embedding condensation is not reliably mitigated by knowledge distillation from larger models. To fight against it, we formulate a dispersion loss that explicitly encourages embedding dispersion during training. Experiments demonstrate that it mitigates condensation, recovers dispersion patterns seen in larger models, and yields performance gains across 10 benchmarks. We believe this work offers a principled path toward improving smaller Transformers without additional parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying truly predictive covariates while strictly controlling false discoveries remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear, highly correlated, and low signal-to-noise regimes, where deep learning based feature selection methods are most attractive. We propose Group Regularization Importance Persistence in 2 Dimensions (GRIP2), a deep knockoff feature importance statistic that integrates first-layer feature activity over a two-dimensional regularization surface controlling both sparsity strength and sparsification geometry. To approximate this surface integral in a single training run, we introduce efficient block-stochastic sampling, which aggregates feature activity magnitudes across diverse regularization regimes along the optimization trajectory. The resulting statistics are antisymmetric by construction, ensuring finite-sample FDR control. In extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-real data, GRIP2 demonstrates improved robustness to feature correlation and noise level: in high correlation and low signal-to-noise ratio regimes where standard deep learning based feature selectors may struggle, our method retains high power and stability. Finally, on real-world HIV drug resistance data, GRIP2 recovers known resistance-associated mutations with power better than established linear baselines, confirming its reliability in practice.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Green-NAS, a multi-objective NAS (neural architecture search) framework designed for low-resource environments using weather forecasting as a case study. By adhering to 'Green AI' principles, the framework explicitly minimizes computational energy costs and carbon footprints, prioritizing sustainable deployment over raw computational scale. The Green-NAS architecture search method is optimized for both model accuracy and efficiency to find lightweight models with high accuracy and very few model parameters; this is accomplished through an optimization process that simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives. Our best-performing model, Green-NAS-A, achieved an RMSE of 0.0988 (i.e., within 1.4% of our manually tuned baseline) using only 153k model parameters, which is 239 times fewer than other globally applied weather forecasting models, such as GraphCast. In addition, we also describe how the use of transfer learning will improve the weather forecasting accuracy by approximately 5.2%, in comparison to a naive approach of training a new model for each city, when there is limited historical weather data available for that city.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising non-autoregressive paradigm for generative tasks, offering parallel decoding and bidirectional context utilization. However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation. We will release the code.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00269v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying modern Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) in streaming settings requires systems that provide low latency, high throughput, and strong guarantees of streamability. Existing systems fall short of supporting diverse models flexibly and efficiently. We present VoxServe, a unified serving system for SpeechLMs that optimizes streaming performance. VoxServe introduces a model-execution abstraction that decouples model architecture from system-level optimizations, thereby enabling support for diverse SpeechLM architectures within a single framework. Building on this abstraction, VoxServe implements streaming-aware scheduling and an asynchronous inference pipeline to improve end-to-end efficiency. Evaluations across multiple modern SpeechLMs show that VoxServe achieves 10-20x higher throughput than existing implementations at comparable latency while maintaining high streaming viability. The code of VoxServe is available at https://github.com/vox-serve/vox-serve.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Several important problem settings within the literature of reinforcement learning (RL), such as meta-learning, hierarchical learning, and RL from human feedback (RL-HF), can be modelled as bilevel RL problems. A lot has been achieved in these domains empirically; however, the theoretical analysis of bilevel RL algorithms hasn't received a lot of attention. In this work, we analyse the sample complexity of a constrained bilevel RL algorithm, building on the progress in the unconstrained setting. We obtain an iteration complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ and sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for our proposed algorithm, Constrained Bilevel Subgradient Optimization (CBSO). We use a penalty-based objective function to avoid the issue of primal-dual gap and hyper-gradient in the context of a constrained bilevel problem setting. The penalty-based formulation to handle constraints requires analysis of non-smooth optimization. We are the first ones to analyse the generally parameterized policy gradient-based RL algorithm with a non-smooth objective function using the Moreau envelope.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) significantly accelerate inference by trading off sequential determinism. However, the theoretical mechanisms governing generation order and the risks inherent in parallelization remain under-explored. In this work, we provide a unified information-theoretic framework to decouple and analyze two fundamental sources of failure: order sensitivity and parallelization bias. Our analysis yields three key insights: (1) The benefits of Easy-First decoding (prioritizing low-entropy tokens) are magnified as model error increases; (2) factorized parallel decoding introduces intrinsic sampling errors that can lead to arbitrary large Reverse KL divergence, capturing "incoherence" failures that standard Forward KL metrics overlook; and (3) while verification can eliminate sampling error, it incurs an exponential cost governed by the total correlation within a block. Conversely, heuristics like remasking, though computationally efficient, cannot guarantee distributional correctness. Experiments on a controlled Block-HMM and large-scale MDMs (LLaDA) for arithmetic reasoning validate our theoretical framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00294v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The most widely used artificial intelligence (AI) models today are Transformers employing self-attention. In its standard form, self-attention incurs costs that increase with context length, driving demand for storage, compute, and energy that is now outstripping society's ability to provide them. To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models. The mathematical techniques we introduce are of independent interest.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has achieved strong performance in Time Series Forecasting (TSF). However, we identify a critical representation paradox, termed Latent Chaos: models with accurate predictions often learn latent representations that are temporally disordered and lack continuity. We attribute this phenomenon to the dominant observation-space forecasting paradigm. Most TSF models minimize point-wise errors on noisy and partially observed data, which encourages shortcut solutions instead of the recovery of underlying system dynamics. To address this issue, we propose Latent Time Series Forecasting (LatentTSF), a novel paradigm that shifts TSF from observation regression to latent state prediction. Specifically, LatentTSF employs an AutoEncoder to project observations at each time step into a higher-dimensional latent state space. This expanded representation aims to capture underlying system variables and impose a smoother temporal structure. Forecasting is then performed entirely in the latent space, allowing the model to focus on learning structured temporal dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed latent objectives implicitly maximize mutual information between predicted latent states and ground-truth states and observations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks confirm that LatentTSF effectively mitigates latent chaos, achieving superior performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/LatentTSF.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00299v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Epidemic modeling is essential for public health planning, yet traditional approaches rely on fixed model classes that require manual redesign as pathogens, policies, and scenario assumptions evolve. We introduce EPIAGENT, an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes, calibrates, verifies, and refines epidemiological simulators by modeling disease progression as an iterative program synthesis problem. A central design choice is an explicit epidemiological flow graph intermediate representation that links scenario specifications to model structure and enables strong, modular correctness checks before code is generated. Verified flow graphs are then compiled into mechanistic models supporting interpretable parameter learning under physical and epidemiological constraints. Evaluation on epidemiological scenario case studies demonstrates that EPIAGENT captures complex growth dynamics and produces epidemiologically consistent counterfactual projections across varying vaccination and immune escape assumptions. Our results show that the agentic feedback loop prevents degeneration and significantly accelerates convergence toward valid models by mimicking professional expert workflows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a data-driven heuristic for NP-hard Ising and Max-Cut optimization that learns the update rule of an iterative dynamical system. The method learns a shared, node-wise update rule that maps local interaction fields to spin updates, parameterized by a compact multilayer perceptron with a small number of parameters. Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How close are neural networks to the best they could possibly do? Standard benchmarks cannot answer this because they lack access to the true posterior p(y|x). We use class-conditional normalizing flows as oracles that make exact posteriors tractable on realistic images (AFHQ, ImageNet). This enables five lines of investigation. Scaling laws: Prediction error decomposes into irreducible aleatoric uncertainty and reducible epistemic error; the epistemic component follows a power law in dataset size, continuing to shrink even when total loss plateaus. Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration. Distribution shift: The oracle computes exact KL divergence of controlled perturbations, revealing that shift type matters more than shift magnitude: class imbalance barely affects accuracy at divergence values where input noise causes catastrophic degradation. Active learning: Exact epistemic uncertainty distinguishes genuinely informative samples from inherently ambiguous ones, improving sample efficiency. Our framework reveals that standard metrics hide ongoing learning, mask architectural differences, and cannot diagnose the nature of distribution shift.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rise of bot accounts on social media poses significant risks to public discourse. To address this threat, modern bot detectors increasingly rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the effectiveness of these GNN-based detectors in real-world settings remains poorly understood. In practice, attackers continuously adapt their strategies as well as must operate under domain-specific and temporal constraints, which can fundamentally limit the applicability of existing attack methods. As a result, there is a critical need for robust GNN-based bot detection methods under realistic, constraint-aware attack scenarios.   To address this gap, we introduce BOCLOAK to systematically evaluate the robustness of GNN-based social bot detection via both edge editing and node injection adversarial attacks under realistic constraints. BOCLOAK constructs a probability measure over spatio-temporal neighbor features and learns an optimal transport geometry that separates human and bot behaviors. It then decodes transport plans into sparse, plausible edge edits that evade detection while obeying real-world constraints. We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints. Most importantly, BOCLOAK shows that optimal transport provides a lightweight, principled framework for bridging the gap between adversarial attacks and real-world bot detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by GPU memory capacity rather than compute throughput, driven by growing model sizes and the linear growth of the key-value (KV) cache during autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches mitigate memory pressure by offloading model state and KV tensors to host memory, but incur substantial latency due to limited PCIe bandwidth. We present Harvest, an opportunistic GPU cache management framework that exploits high-bandwidth peer-to-peer GPU interconnects to dynamically place model weights and KV cache in unused GPU memory. Harvest treats peer GPU memory as a transient cache tier, preserving correctness while reducing data movement overhead under dynamic memory availability. We demonstrate significant throughput speedup of more than 2 times by using Harvest to accelerate the retrieval of two widely-used inference components: expert layer weights and KV cache entries.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable data attribution is essential for mitigating bias and reducing computational waste in modern machine learning, with the Shapley value serving as the theoretical gold standard. While recent "In-Run" methods bypass the prohibitive cost of retraining by estimating contributions dynamically, they heavily rely on the linear structure of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and fail to capture the complex dynamics of adaptive optimizers like Adam. In this work, we demonstrate that data attribution is inherently optimizer-dependent: we show that SGD-based proxies diverge significantly from true contributions under Adam (Pearson $R \approx 0.11$), rendering them ineffective for modern training pipelines. To bridge this gap, we propose Adam-Aware In-Run Data Shapley. We derive a closed-form approximation that restores additivity by redefining utility under a fixed-state assumption and enable scalable computation via a novel Linearized Ghost Approximation. This technique linearizes the variance-dependent scaling term, allowing us to compute pairwise gradient dot-products without materializing per-sample gradients. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves near-perfect fidelity to ground-truth marginal contributions ($R > 0.99$) while retaining $\sim$95\% of standard training throughput. Furthermore, our Adam-aware attribution significantly outperforms SGD-based baselines in data attribution downstream tasks.

Prototype-based XAI methods offer an intrinsically interpretable alternative to post-hoc approaches which often yield inconsistent explanations. Prototype-based XAI methods make predictions based on the similarity between inputs and learned prototypes that represent typical characteristics of target classes. However, existing prototype-based models are primarily designed for standard RGB image data and are not optimized for the distinct, variable-specific channels commonly found in geoscientific image and raster datasets. In this study, we develop a prototype-based XAI approach tailored for multi-channel geospatial data, where each channel represents a distinct physical environmental variable or spectral channel. Our approach enables the model to identify separate, channel-specific prototypical characteristics sourced from multiple distinct training examples that inform how these features individually and in combination influence model prediction while achieving comparable performance to standard neural networks. We demonstrate this method through two geoscientific case studies: (1) classification of Madden Julian Oscillation phases using multi-variable climate data and (2) land-use classification from multispectral satellite imagery. This approach produces both local (instance-level) and global (model-level) explanations for providing insights into feature-relevance across channels. By explicitly incorporating channel-prototypes into the prediction process, we discuss how this approach enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of ML models for geoscientific learning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Steering, or direct manipulation of internal activations to guide LLM responses toward specific semantic concepts, is emerging as a promising avenue for both understanding how semantic concepts are stored within LLMs and advancing LLM capabilities. Yet, existing steering methods are remarkably brittle, with seemingly non-steerable concepts becoming completely steerable based on subtle algorithmic choices in how concept-related features are extracted. In this work, we introduce an attention-guided steering framework that overcomes three core challenges associated with steering: (1) automatic selection of relevant token embeddings for extracting concept-related features; (2) accounting for heterogeneity of concept-related features across LLM activations; and (3) identification of layers most relevant for steering. Across a steering benchmark of 512 semantic concepts, our framework substantially improved steering over previous state-of-the-art (nearly doubling the number of successfully steered concepts) across model architectures and sizes (up to 70 billion parameter models). Furthermore, we use our framework to shed light on the distribution of concept-specific features across LLM layers. Overall, our framework opens further avenues for developing efficient, highly-scalable fine-tuning algorithms for industry-scale LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a continuous-time scheme for large-scale optimization that introduces individual, adaptive momentum coefficients regulated by the kinetic energy of each model parameter. This approach automatically adjusts to local landscape curvature to maintain stability without sacrificing convergence speed. We demonstrate that our adaptive friction can be related to cubic damping, a suppression mechanism from structural dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce two specific optimization schemes by augmenting the continuous dynamics of mSGD and Adam with a cubic damping term. Empirically, our methods demonstrate robustness and match or outperform Adam on training ViT, BERT, and GPT2 tasks where mSGD typically struggles. We further provide theoretical results establishing the exponential convergence of the proposed schemes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intelligent access point (AP) deployment remains challenging in next-generation wireless networks due to complex indoor geometries and signal propagation. We firstly benchmark general-purpose large language models (LLMs) as agentic optimizers for AP planning and find that, despite strong wireless domain knowledge, their dependence on external verifiers results in high computational costs and limited scalability. Motivated by these limitations, we study generative inference models guided by a unified reward function capturing core AP deployment objectives across diverse floorplans. We show that diffusion samplers consistently outperform alternative generative approaches. The diffusion process progressively improves sampling by smoothing and sharpening the reward landscape, rather than relying on iterative refinement, which is effective for non-convex and fragmented objectives. Finally, we introduce a large-scale real-world dataset for indoor AP deployment, requiring over $50k$ CPU hours to train general reward functions, and evaluate in- and out-of-distribution generalization and robustness. Our results suggest that diffusion-based generative inference with a unified reward function provides a scalable and domain-agnostic foundation for indoor AP deployment planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00360v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, which includes both image and text data, presents several challenges due to the dissimilarities in the modalities of text and image, the ambiguity of sentiment, and the complexities of contextual meaning. In this work, we experiment with finding the sentiments of image and text data, individually and in combination, on two datasets. Part of the approach introduces the novel `Textual-Cues for Enhancing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis' (TEMSA) based on object recognition methods to address the difficulties in multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we extract the names of all objects detected in an image and combine them with associated text; we call this combination of text and image data TEMS. Our results demonstrate that only TEMS improves the results when considering all the object names for the overall sentiment of multimodal data compared to individual analysis. This research contributes to advancing multimodal sentiment analysis and offers insights into the efficacy of TEMSA in combining image and text data for multimodal sentiment analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00361v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantum kernel methods offer significant theoretical benefits by rendering classically inseparable features separable in quantum space. Yet, the practical application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), currently constrained by the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, necessitates effective strategies to compress and embed large-scale real-world data like images into the constrained capacities of existing quantum devices or simulators. To this end, we propose Quantum Generator Kernels (QGKs), a generator-based approach to quantum kernels, comprising a set of Variational Generator Groups (VGGs) that merge universal generators into a parameterizable operator, ensuring scalable coverage of the available quantum space. Thereby, we address shortcomings of current leading strategies employing hybrid architectures, which might prevent exploiting quantum computing's full potential due to fixed intermediate embedding processes. To optimize the kernel alignment to the target domain, we train a weight vector to parameterize the projection of the VGGs in the current data context. Our empirical results demonstrate superior projection and classification capabilities of the QGK compared to state-of-the-art quantum and classical kernel approaches and show its potential to serve as a versatile framework for various QML applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00372v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are expensive to deploy. We introduce Sparse Knowledge Distillation (SparseKD), a post-training method that compresses transformer models by combining structured SVD pruning with self-referential knowledge distillation. The key insight is simple: instead of using an external teacher, the model teaches itself by matching its own probability distribution from before compression. This self-referential setup enables surprisingly strong quality recovery after aggressive pruning.   Our experiments reveal an unexpected finding: self-referential distillation alone, applied post-training under an identical objective and fixed calibration dataset, improves model quality by 39% relative to the original converged checkpoint. When combined with structured pruning, SparseKD achieves 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs. Kernel profiling shows that speedups arise entirely from reduced dense matrix multiplication in feed-forward layers while attention remains unchanged, making this approach complementary to attention optimizations.   We validate across two model families (0.6B and 3.8B parameters) with multi-seed experiments confirming high reproducibility. SparseKD requires no external super-teacher, no architectural changes, and no custom inference kernels, making it immediately deployable with existing infrastructure.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00376v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scientific reasoning in materials science requires integrating multimodal experimental evidence with underlying physical theory. Existing benchmarks make it difficult to assess whether incorporating visual experimental data during post-training improves mechanism-grounded explanation reasoning beyond text-only supervision. We introduce MATRIX, a multimodal benchmark for materials science reasoning that evaluates foundational theory, research-level reasoning, and the interpretation of real experimental artifacts across multiple characterization modalities. Using MATRIX as a controlled diagnostic, we isolate the effect of visual grounding by comparing post-training on structured materials science text alone with post-training that incorporates paired experimental images. Despite using relatively small amounts of multimodal data, visual supervision improves experimental interpretation by 10-25% and yields 5-16% gains on text-only scientific reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that these improvements rely on correct image-text alignment during post-training, highlighting cross-modal representational transfer. We also observe consistent improvements on ScienceQA and PubMedQA, demonstrating that the benefits of structured multimodal post-training extend beyond materials science. The MATRIX dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/radical-ai/MATRIX and the model at https://huggingface.co/radical-ai/MATRIX-PT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a RePaint-enhanced framework that integrates a pre-trained performance-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for performance- and parameter-constraint engineering design generation. The proposed method enables the generation of missing design components based on a partial reference design while satisfying performance constraints, without retraining the underlying model. By applying mask-based resampling during inference process, RePaint allows efficient and controllable repainting of partial designs under both performance and parameter constraints, which is not supported by conventional DDPM-base methods. The framework is evaluated on two representative design problems, parametric ship hull design and airfoil design, demonstrating its ability to generate novel designs with expected performance based on a partial reference design. Results show that the method achieves accuracy comparable to or better than pre-trained models while enabling controlled novelty through fixing partial designs. Overall, the proposed approach provides an efficient, training-free solution for parameter-constraint-aware generative design in engineering applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) offer an alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) and have demonstrated advantages in generation efficiency. Beyond the utility benefits, we argue that D-LLMs exhibit a previously underexplored safety blessing: their diffusion-style generation confers intrinsic robustness against jailbreak attacks originally designed for AR-LLMs. In this work, we provide an initial analysis of the underlying mechanism, showing that the diffusion trajectory induces a stepwise reduction effect that progressively suppresses unsafe generations. This robustness, however, is not absolute. We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism. Empirically, we show that this simple strategy is sufficient to bypass D-LLMs' safety blessing, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across models and benchmarks. Most notably, it enables the first successful jailbreak of Gemini Diffusion, to our knowledge, exposing a critical vulnerability in commercial D-LLMs. Together, our results characterize both the origins and the limits of D-LLMs' safety blessing, constituting an early-stage red-teaming of D-LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00392v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geographic data is fundamentally local. Disease outbreaks cluster in population centers, ecological patterns emerge along coastlines, and economic activity concentrates within country borders. Machine learning models that encode geographic location, however, distribute representational capacity uniformly across the globe, struggling at the fine-grained resolutions that localized applications require. We propose a geographic location encoder built from spherical Slepian functions that concentrate representational capacity inside a region-of-interest and scale to high resolutions without extensive computational demands. For settings requiring global context, we present a hybrid Slepian-Spherical Harmonic encoder that efficiently bridges the tradeoff between local-global performance, while retaining desirable properties such as pole-safety and spherical-surface-distance preservation. Across five tasks spanning classification, regression, and image-augmented prediction, Slepian encodings outperform baselines and retain performance advantages across a wide range of neural network architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prefill stage of large language model (LLM) inference is a key computational bottleneck for long-context workloads. At short-to-moderate context lengths (1K--16K tokens), Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) dominate this cost, accounting for most of the total FLOPs. Existing FFN sparsification methods, designed for autoregressive decoding, fail to exploit the prefill stage's parallelism and often degrade accuracy. To address this, we introduce FastForward, a predictive sparsity framework that accelerates LLM prefill through block-wise, context-aware FFN sparsity. FastForward combines (1) a lightweight expert predictor to select high-importance neurons per block, (2) an error compensation network to correct sparsity-induced errors, and (3) a layer-wise sparsity scheduler to allocate compute based on token-mixing importance. Across LLaMA and Qwen models up to 8B parameters, FastForward delivers up to 1.45$\times$ compute-bound speedup at 50% FFN sparsity with $<$ 6% accuracy loss compared to the dense baseline on LongBench, substantially reducing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) for efficient, long-context LLM inference on constrained hardware.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00398v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding how transformer components operate in LLMs is important, as it is at the core of recent technological advances in artificial intelligence. In this work, we revisit the challenges associated with interpretability of feed-forward modules (FFNs) and propose MemoryLLM, which aims to decouple FFNs from self-attention and enables us to study the decoupled FFNs as context-free token-wise neural retrieval memory. In detail, we investigate how input tokens access memory locations within FFN parameters and the importance of FFN memory across different downstream tasks. MemoryLLM achieves context-free FFNs by training them in isolation from self-attention directly using the token embeddings. This approach allows FFNs to be pre-computed as token-wise lookups (ToLs), enabling on-demand transfer between VRAM and storage, additionally enhancing inference efficiency. We also introduce Flex-MemoryLLM, positioning it between a conventional transformer design and MemoryLLM. This architecture bridges the performance gap caused by training FFNs with context-free token-wise embeddings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00403v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In computational reinforcement learning, the default representation (DR) and its principal eigenvector have been shown to be effective for a wide variety of applications, including reward shaping, count-based exploration, option discovery, and transfer. However, in prior investigations, the eigenvectors of the DR were computed by first approximating the DR matrix, and then performing an eigendecomposition. This procedure is computationally expensive and does not scale to high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we derive an objective for directly approximating the principal eigenvector of the DR with a neural network. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the objective in a number of environments, and apply the learned eigenvectors for reward shaping.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00407v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been intensively studied for their expressive representation and learning performance on graph-structured data, enabling effective modeling of complex relational dependencies among nodes and edges in various domains. However, the standalone GNNs can unleash threat surfaces and privacy implications, as some sensitive graph-structured data is collected and processed in a centralized setting. To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios. Moreover, applying defense mechanisms can barely reduce our attack performance, unless the model's utility is severely degraded.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Variational Graph-to-Scheduler (VG2S) framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a critical task in manufacturing that directly impacts operational efficiency and resource utilization. Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often face challenges such as non-stationarity during training and limited generalization to unseen problem instances because they optimize representation learning and policy execution simultaneously. To address these issues, we introduce variational inference to the JSSP domain for the first time and derive a probabilistic objective based on the Evidence of Lower Bound (ELBO) with maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By mathematically decoupling representation learning from policy optimization, the VG2S framework enables the agent to learn robust structural representations of scheduling instances through a variational graph encoder. This approach significantly enhances training stability and robustness against hyperparameter variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior zero-shot generalization compared with state-of-the-art DRL baselines and traditional dispatching rules, particularly on large-scale and challenging benchmark instances such as DMU and SWV.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00412v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The goal of automated machine learning (AutoML) is to reduce trial and error when doing machine learning (ML). Although AutoML methods for classification are able to deal with data imperfections, such as outliers, multiple scales and missing data, their behavior is less known on dirty categorical datasets. These datasets often have several categorical features with high cardinality arising from issues such as lack of curation and automated collection. Recent research has shown that ML models can benefit from morphological encoders for dirty categorical data, leading to significantly superior predictive performance. However the effects of using such encoders in AutoML methods are not known at the moment. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that transforms categorical data into numerical data so that an AutoML can handle categorical data transformed by more advanced encoding schemes. We benchmark the current robustness of AutoML methods on a set of dirty datasets and compare it with the proposed pipeline. This allows us to get insight on differences in predictive performance. We also look at the ML pipelines built by AutoMLs in order to gain insight beyond the best model as typically returned by these methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00423v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing enable the rapid generation of massive, high-dimensional datasets, yet the accumulation of data across experiments introduces batch effects that obscure true biological signals. Existing batch correction approaches either insufficiently correct batch effects or require centralized retraining on the complete dataset, limiting their applicability in distributed and continually evolving single-cell data settings. We introduce scBatchProx, a post-hoc optimization method inspired by federated learning principles for refining cell-level embeddings produced by arbitrary upstream methods. Treating each batch as a client, scBatchProx learns batch-conditioned adapters under proximal regularization, correcting batch structure directly in latent space without requiring raw expression data or centralized optimization. The method is lightweight and deployable, optimizing batch-specific adapter parameters only. Extensive experiments show that scBatchProx consistently yields relative gains of approximately 3-8% in overall embedding quality, with batch correction and biological conservation improving in 90% and 85% of data-method pairs, respectively. We envision this work as a step toward the practical refinement of learned representations in dynamic single-cell data systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00424v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures are typically described through collections of architectural components and training procedures, obscuring their underlying computational structure. This review article provides a concise mathematical reference for researchers seeking an explicit, equation-level description of LLM training, alignment, and generation. We formulate LLMs as high-dimensional nonlinear autoregressive models with attention-based dependencies. The framework encompasses pretraining via next-token prediction, alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), rejection sampling fine-tuning (RSFT), and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), as well as autoregressive generation during inference. Self-attention emerges naturally as a repeated bilinear--softmax--linear composition, yielding highly expressive sequence models. This formulation enables principled analysis of alignment-induced behaviors (including sycophancy), inference-time phenomena (such as hallucination, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation), and extensions like continual learning, while serving as a concise reference for interpretation and further theoretical development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-sourcing foundation models (FMs) enables broad reuse but also exposes model trainers to economic and safety risks from unrestricted downstream fine-tuning. We address this problem by building non-fine-tunable foundation models: models that remain broadly usable in their released form while yielding limited adaptation gains under task-agnostic unauthorized fine-tuning. We propose Private Mask Pre-Training (PMP), a pre-training framework that concentrates representation learning into a sparse subnetwork identified early in training. The binary mask defining this subnetwork is kept private, and only the final dense weights are released. This forces unauthorized fine-tuning without access to the mask to update parameters misaligned with pretraining subspace, inducing an intrinsic mismatch between the fine-tuning objective and the pre-training geometry. We provide theoretical analysis showing that this mismatch destabilizes gradient-based adaptation and bounds fine-tuning gains. Empirical results on large language models demonstrating that PMP preserves base model performance while consistently degrading unauthorized fine-tuning across a wide range of downstream tasks, with the strength of non-fine-tunability controlled by the mask ratio.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL), a serverless variant of federated learning, poses unique challenges for parameter-efficient fine-tuning due to the factorized structure of low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Unlike linear parameters, decentralized aggregation of LoRA updates introduces topology-dependent cross terms that can destabilize training under dynamic communication graphs. We propose \texttt{TAD-LoRA}, a Topology-Aware Decentralized Low-Rank Adaptation framework that coordinates the updates and mixing of LoRA factors to control inter-client misalignment. We theoretically prove the convergence of \texttt{TAD-LoRA} under non-convex objectives, explicitly characterizing the trade-off between topology-induced cross-term error and block-coordinate representation bias governed by the switching interval of alternative training. Experiments under various communication conditions validate our analysis, showing that \texttt{TAD-LoRA} achieves robust performance across different communication scenarios, remaining competitive in strongly connected topologies and delivering clear gains under moderately and weakly connected topologies, with particularly strong results on the MNLI dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00453v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as an effective approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models through online multi-objective reinforcement learning. While personalization on private data is increasingly vital, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) alignment is often memory-prohibitive for on-device federated learning due to the overhead of maintaining a separate critic network. GRPO's critic-free architecture enables feasible on-device training, yet transitioning to a federated setting introduces systemic challenges: heterogeneous reward definitions, imbalanced multi-objective optimization, and high training costs. We propose FedMOA, a federated GRPO framework for multi-objective alignment under heterogeneous rewards. FedMOA stabilizes local training through an online adaptive weighting mechanism via hypergradient descent, which prioritizes primary reasoning as auxiliary objectives saturate. On the server side, it utilizes a task- and accuracy-aware aggregation strategy to prioritize high-quality updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that FedMOA consistently outperforms federated averaging, achieving accuracy gains of up to 2.2% while improving global performance, personalization, and multi-objective balance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00458v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce LatentTrack (LT), a sequential neural architecture for online probabilistic prediction under nonstationary dynamics. LT performs causal Bayesian filtering in a low-dimensional latent space and uses a lightweight hypernetwork to generate predictive model parameters at each time step, enabling constant-time online adaptation without per-step gradient updates.   At each time step, a learned latent model predicts the next latent distribution, which is updated via amortized inference using new observations, yielding a predict--generate--update filtering framework in function space. The formulation supports both structured (Markovian) and unstructured latent dynamics within a unified objective, while Monte Carlo inference over latent trajectories produces calibrated predictive mixtures with fixed per-step cost. Evaluated on long-horizon online regression using the Jena Climate benchmark, LT consistently achieves lower negative log-likelihood and mean squared error than stateful sequential and static uncertainty-aware baselines, with competitive calibration, demonstrating that latent-conditioned function evolution is an effective alternative to traditional latent-state modeling under distribution shift.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00460v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Exploration in environments with sparse rewards remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Existing approaches such as curriculum learning and Go-Explore often rely on hand-crafted heuristics, while curiosity-driven methods risk converging to suboptimal policies. We propose Search-Inspired Exploration in Reinforcement Learning (SIERL), a novel method that actively guides exploration by setting sub-goals based on the agent's learning progress. At the beginning of each episode, SIERL chooses a sub-goal from the \textit{frontier} (the boundary of the agent's known state space), before the agent continues exploring toward the main task objective. The key contribution of our method is the sub-goal selection mechanism, which provides state-action pairs that are neither overly familiar nor completely novel. Thus, it assures that the frontier is expanded systematically and that the agent is capable of reaching any state within it. Inspired by search, sub-goals are prioritized from the frontier based on estimates of cost-to-come and cost-to-go, effectively steering exploration towards the most informative regions. In experiments on challenging sparse-reward environments, SIERL outperforms dominant baselines in both achieving the main task goal and generalizing to reach arbitrary states in the environment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Functional miRNA--mRNA targeting is a large-bag prediction problem: each transcript yields a heavy-tailed pool of candidate target sites (CTSs), yet only a pair-level label is observed. We formalize this regime as \emph{Budgeted Relational Multi-Instance Learning (BR-MIL)}, where at most $K$ instances per bag may receive expensive encoding and relational processing under a hard compute budget. We propose \textbf{PAIR-Former} (Pool-Aware Instance-Relational Transformer), a BR-MIL pipeline that performs a cheap full-pool scan, selects up to $K$ diverse CTSs on CPU, and applies a permutation-invariant Set Transformer aggregator on the selected tokens. On miRAW, PAIR-Former outperforms strong pooling baselines at a practical operating budget ($K^\star{=}64$) while providing a controllable accuracy--compute trade-off as $K$ varies. We further provide theory linking budgeted selection to (i) approximation error decreasing with $K$ and (ii) generalization terms governed by $K$ in the expensive relational component.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models simulate environment dynamics from raw sensory inputs like video. However, using them for planning can be challenging due to the vast and unstructured search space. We propose a robust and highly parallelizable planner that leverages the differentiability of the learned world model for efficient optimization, solving long-horizon control tasks from visual input. Our method treats states as optimization variables ("virtual states") with soft dynamics constraints, enabling parallel computation and easier optimization. To facilitate exploration and avoid local optima, we introduce stochasticity into the states. To mitigate sensitive gradients through high-dimensional vision-based world models, we modify the gradient structure to descend towards valid plans while only requiring action-input gradients. Our planner, which we call GRASP (Gradient RelAxed Stochastic Planner), can be viewed as a stochastic version of a non-condensed or collocation-based optimal controller. We provide theoretical justification and experiments on video-based world models, where our resulting planner outperforms existing planning algorithms like the cross-entropy method (CEM) and vanilla gradient-based optimization (GD) on long-horizon experiments, both in success rate and time to convergence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) provide a bidirectional generation framework naturally suited for infilling, yet their performance is constrained by the pre-specified infilling length. In this paper, we reveal that DLMs possess an inherent ability to discover the correct infilling length. We identify two key statistical phenomena in the first-step denoising confidence: a local \textit{Oracle Peak} that emerges near the ground-truth length and a systematic \textit{Length Bias} that often obscures this signal. By leveraging this signal and calibrating the bias, our training-free method \textbf{CAL} (\textbf{C}alibrated \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{L}ength) enables DLMs to approximate the optimal length through an efficient search before formal decoding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CAL improves Pass@1 by up to 47.7\% over fixed-length baselines and 40.5\% over chat-based adaptive methods in code infilling, while boosting BLEU-2 and ROUGE-L by up to 8.5\% and 9.9\% in text infilling. These results demonstrate that CAL paves the way for robust DLM infilling without requiring any specialized training. Code is available at https://github.com/NiuHechang/Calibrated_Adaptive_Length.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization aims to discover a collection of high-performing solutions that simultaneously exhibit diverse behaviors within a user-defined behavior space. This paradigm has stimulated significant research interest and demonstrated practical utility in domains including robot control, creative design, and adversarial sample generation. A variety of QD algorithms with distinct design principles have been proposed in recent years. Instead of proposing a new QD algorithm, this work introduces a novel reformulation by casting the QD optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with a huge number of optimization objectives. By establishing this connection, we enable the direct adoption of well-established MOO methods, particularly set-based scalarization techniques, to solve QD problems through a collaborative search process. We further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach inherits theoretical guarantees from MOO while providing desirable properties for the QD optimization. Experimental studies across several QD applications confirm that our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art QD algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00482v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training for large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, as it generates many rollout sequences that could frequently share long token prefixes. Existing RL frameworks usually process these sequences independently, repeatedly recomputing identical prefixes during forward and backward passes during policy model training, leading to substantial inefficiencies in computation and memory usage. Although prefix sharing naturally induces a tree structure over rollouts, prior tree-attention-based solutions rely on fully materialized attention masks and scale poorly in RL settings. In this paper, we introduce AREAL-DTA to efficiently exploit prefix sharing in RL training. AREAL-DTA employs a depth-first-search (DFS)-based execution strategy that dynamically traverses the rollout prefix tree during both forward and backward computation, materializing only a single root-to-leaf path at a time. To further improve scalability, AREAL-DTA incorporates a load-balanced distributed batching mechanism that dynamically constructs and processes prefix trees across multiple GPUs. Across the popular RL post-training workload, AREAL-DTA achieves up to $8.31\times$ in $\tau^2$-bench higher training throughput.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving large-scale capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRP) is hindered by the high complexity of heuristics and the limited generalization of neural solvers on massive graphs. We propose OD-DEAL, an adversarial learning framework that tightly integrates hybrid genetic search (HGS) and online barycenter clustering (BCC) decomposition, and leverages high-fidelity knowledge distillation to transfer expert heuristic behavior. OD-DEAL trains a graph attention network (GAT)-based generative policy through a minimax game, in which divide-and-conquer strategies from a hybrid expert are distilled into dense surrogate rewards. This enables high-quality, clustering-free inference on large-scale instances. Empirical results demonstrate that OD-DEAL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) real-time CVRP performance, solving 10000-node instances with near-constant neural scaling. This uniquely enables the sub-second, heuristic-quality inference required for dynamic large-scale deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00511v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural network classifiers remain difficult to interpret. In softmax-based models, class regions are defined implicitly as solutions to systems of inequalities among logits, making them difficult to extract and visualize. We introduce Partition of Unity Neural Networks (PUNN), an architecture in which class probabilities arise directly from a learned partition of unity, without requiring a softmax layer.   PUNN constructs $k$ nonnegative functions $h_1, \ldots, h_k$ satisfying $\sum_i h_i(x) = 1$, where each $h_i(x)$ directly represents $P(\text{class } i \mid x)$. Unlike softmax, where class regions are defined implicitly through coupled inequalities among logits, each PUNN partition function $h_i$ directly defines the probability of class $i$ as a standalone function of $x$.   We prove that PUNN is dense in the space of continuous probability maps on compact domains. The gate functions $g_i$ that define the partition can use various activation functions (sigmoid, Gaussian, bump) and parameterizations ranging from flexible MLPs to parameter-efficient shape-informed designs (spherical shells, ellipsoids, spherical harmonics).   Experiments on synthetic data, UCI benchmarks, and MNIST show that PUNN with MLP-based gates achieves accuracy within 0.3--0.6\% of standard multilayer perceptrons. When geometric priors match the data structure, shape-informed gates achieve comparable accuracy with up to 300$\times$ fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that interpretable-by-design architectures can be competitive with black-box models while providing transparent class probability assignments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00513v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysts routinely convert noisy, unstructured security artifacts into standardized, automation-ready representations. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task, existing approaches remain brittle when producing structured CTI outputs and have largely relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In contrast, CTI standards and community-maintained resources define canonical identifiers and schemas that enable deterministic verification of model outputs. We leverage this structure to study reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for CTI tasks. We introduce \textit{Minerva}, a unified dataset and training pipeline spanning multiple CTI subtasks, each paired with task-specific verifiers that score structured outputs and identifier predictions. To address reward sparsity during rollout, we propose a lightweight self-training mechanism that generates additional verified trajectories and distills them back into the model. Experiments across LLM backbones show consistent improvements in accuracy and robustness over SFT across multiple benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates intelligent sensing, communication, and analytics into industrial environments, including manufacturing, energy, and critical infrastructure. While IIoT enables predictive maintenance and cross-site optimization of modern industrial control systems, such as those in manufacturing and energy, it also introduces significant privacy and confidentiality risks due to the sensitivity of operational data. Contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation learning paradigm, has recently emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving analytics by reducing reliance on labeled data and raw data sharing. Although contrastive learning-based privacy-preserving techniques have been explored in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, this paper offers a comprehensive review of these techniques specifically for privacy preservation in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems. It emphasizes the unique characteristics of industrial data, system architectures, and various application scenarios. Additionally, the paper discusses solutions and open challenges and outlines future research directions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00520v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event stream data often exhibit hierarchical structure in which multiple events co-occur, resulting in a sequence of multisets (i.e., bags of events). In electronic health records (EHRs), for example, medical events are grouped into a sequence of clinical encounters with well-defined temporal structure, but the order and timing of events within each encounter may be unknown or unreliable. Most existing foundation models (FMs) for event stream data flatten this hierarchy into a one-dimensional sequence, leading to (i) computational inefficiency associated with dense attention and learning spurious within-set relationships, and (ii) lower-quality set-level representations from heuristic post-training pooling for downstream tasks. Here, we show that preserving the original hierarchy in the FM architecture provides a useful inductive bias that improves both computational efficiency and representation quality. We then introduce Nested Event Stream Transformer (NEST), a FM for event streams comprised of sequences of multisets. Building on this architecture, we formulate Masked Set Modeling (MSM), an efficient paradigm that promotes improved set-level representation learning. Experiments on real-world multiset sequence data show that NEST captures real-world dynamics while improving both pretraining efficiency and downstream performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel cross-physiology translation task: synthesizing sleep electroencephalography (EEG) from respiration signals. To address the significant complexity gap between the two modalities, we propose a waveform-conditional generative framework that preserves fine-grained respiratory dynamics while constraining the EEG target space through discrete tokenization. Trained on over 28,000 individuals, our model achieves a 7% Mean Absolute Error in EEG spectrogram reconstruction. Beyond reconstruction, the synthesized EEG supports downstream tasks with performance comparable to ground truth EEG on age estimation (MAE 5.0 vs. 5.1 years), sex detection (AUROC 0.81 vs. 0.82), and sleep staging (Accuracy 0.84 vs. 0.88), significantly outperforming baselines trained directly on breathing. Finally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes to contactless sensing by synthesizing EEG from wireless radio-frequency reflections, highlighting the feasibility of remote, non-contact neurological assessment during sleep.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While neural representations are central to modern deep learning, the conditions governing their geometry and their roles in downstream adaptability remain poorly understood. We develop a framework clearly separating the underlying world, the data generation process and the resulting model representations to study these questions in a controlled setup. 5,075 city coordinates define the world and 7 geometric tasks generate the training data for autoregressive training. We find that different tasks give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively distinct world representation geometries. However, multi-task training drives convergence of world representations: models trained on non-overlapping tasks develop aligned geometric representations, providing controlled evidence for the Multitask Scaling Hypothesis of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. To study adaptation, we pretrain models on all tasks, then test whether new entities (cities) can be consistently integrated into the representation space via fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that despite multi-task pretraining, some tasks, which we call divergent, actively harm the representational integration of new entities and harm generalization. Our results show that training on multiple relational tasks reliably produces convergent world representations, but lurking divergent tasks can catastrophically harm new entity integration via fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00534v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State space models (SSMs) often sacrifice capacity, search space, or stability to offset the memory and compute costs of large state dimensions. We introduce a structured post-training pruning method for SSMs -- AIRE-Prune (Asymptotic Impulse-Response Energy for State PRUN(E)) -- that reduces each layer's state dimension by directly minimizing long-run output-energy distortion. AIRE-Prune assigns every state a closed-form asymptotic impulse-response energy-based score, i.e., the total impulse-response energy it contributes over an infinite horizon (time), and normalizes these scores layer-wise to enable global cross-layer comparison and selection. This extends modal truncation from single systems to deep stacks and aligns pruning with asymptotic response energy rather than worst-case gain. Across diverse sequence benchmarks, AIRE-Prune reveals substantial redundancy in SISO and MIMO SSMs with average pruning of 60.8%, with average accuracy drop of 0.29% without retraining, while significantly lowering compute.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long sequence neural memory remains a challenging problem. RNNs and their variants suffer from vanishing gradients, and Transformers suffer from quadratic scaling. Furthermore, compressing long sequences into a finite fixed representation remains an intractable problem due to the difficult optimization landscape. Invertible Memory Flow Networks (IMFN) make long sequence compression tractable through factorization: instead of learning end-to-end compression, we decompose the problem into pairwise merges using a binary tree of "sweeper" modules. Rather than learning to compress long sequences, each sweeper learns a much simpler 2-to-1 compression task, achieving O(log N) depth with sublinear error accumulation in sequence length. For online inference, we distilled into a constant-cost recurrent student achieving O(1) sequential steps. Empirical results validate IMFN on long MNIST sequences and UCF-101 videos, demonstrating compression of high-dimensional data over long sequences.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00539v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) significantly influence therapeutic efficacy and patient safety. As experimental discovery is resource-intensive and time-consuming, efficient computational methodologies have become essential. The predominant paradigm formulates DDI prediction as a drug graph-based link prediction task. However, further progress is hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) lack of high-quality data: most studies rely on small-scale DDI datasets and single-modal drug representations; (2) lack of standardized evaluation: inconsistent scenarios, varied metrics, and diverse baselines. To address the above issues, we propose OpenDDI, a comprehensive benchmark for DDI prediction. Specifically, (1) from the data perspective, OpenDDI unifies 6 widely used DDI datasets and 2 existing forms of drug representation, while additionally contributing 3 new large-scale LLM-augmented datasets and a new multimodal drug representation covering 5 modalities. (2) From the evaluation perspective, OpenDDI unifies 20 SOTA model baselines across 3 downstream tasks, with standardized protocols for data quality, effectiveness, generalization, robustness, and efficiency. Based on OpenDDI, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and derive 10 valuable insights for DDI prediction while exposing current limitations to provide critical guidance for this rapidly evolving field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical events captured in Electronic Health Records (EHR) are irregularly sampled and may consist of a mixture of discrete events and numerical measurements, such as laboratory values or treatment dosages. The sequential nature of EHR, analogous to natural language, has motivated the use of next-token prediction to train prior EHR Foundation Models (FMs) over events. However, this training fails to capture the full structure of EHR. We propose ORA, a marked time-to-event pretraining objective that jointly models event timing and associated measurements. Across multiple datasets, downstream tasks, and model architectures, this objective consistently yields more generalizable representations than next-token prediction and pretraining losses that ignore continuous measurements. Importantly, the proposed objective yields improvements beyond traditional classification evaluation, including better regression and time-to-event prediction. Beyond introducing a new family of FMs, our results suggest a broader takeaway: pretraining objectives that account for EHR structure are critical for expanding downstream capabilities and generalizability

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00545v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The eigenvalue distribution of the Hessian matrix plays a crucial role in understanding the optimization landscape of deep neural networks. Prior work has attributed the well-documented ``bulk-and-spike'' spectral structure, where a few dominant eigenvalues are separated from a bulk of smaller ones, to the imbalance in the data covariance matrix. In this work, we challenge this view by demonstrating that such spectral Bifurcation can arise purely from the network architecture, independent of data imbalance.   Specifically, we analyze a deep linear network setup and prove that, even when the data covariance is perfectly balanced, the Hessian still exhibits a Bifurcation eigenvalue structure: a dominant cluster and a bulk cluster. Crucially, we establish that the ratio between dominant and bulk eigenvalues scales linearly with the network depth. This reveals that the spectral gap is strongly affected by the network architecture rather than solely by data distribution. Our results suggest that both model architecture and data characteristics should be considered when designing optimization algorithms for deep networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00547v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying molecules from mass spectrometry (MS) data remains a fundamental challenge due to the semantic gap between physical spectral peaks and underlying chemical structures. Existing deep learning approaches often treat spectral matching as a closed-set recognition task, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen molecular scaffolds. To overcome this limitation, we propose a cross-modal alignment framework that directly maps mass spectra into the chemically meaningful molecular structure embedding space of a pretrained chemical language model. On a strict scaffold-disjoint benchmark, our model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 42.2% in fixed 256-way zero-shot retrieval and demonstrates strong generalization under a global retrieval setting. Moreover, the learned embedding space demonstrates strong chemical coherence, reaching 95.4% accuracy in 5-way 5-shot molecular re-identification. These results suggest that explicitly integrating physical spectral resolution with molecular structure embedding is key to solving the generalization bottleneck in molecular identification from MS data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00549v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) shows promise in Large Language Model (LLM) based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD), it suffers from a critical over-exploitation tendency under the limited computational budgets required for heuristic evaluation. To address this limitation, we propose Clade-AHD, an efficient framework that replaces node-level point estimates with clade-level Bayesian beliefs. By aggregating descendant evaluations into Beta distributions and performing Thompson Sampling over these beliefs, Clade-AHD explicitly models uncertainty to guide exploration, enabling more reliable decision-making under sparse and noisy evaluations. Extensive experiments on complex combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that Clade-AHD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00567v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of quantized neural networks on edge devices, combined with privacy regulations like GDPR, creates an urgent need for machine unlearning in quantized models. However, existing methods face critical challenges: they induce forgetting by training models to memorize incorrect labels, conflating forgetting with misremembering, and employ scalar gradient reweighting that cannot resolve directional conflicts between gradients. We propose OEU, a novel Orthogonal Entropy Unlearning framework with two key innovations: 1) Entropy-guided unlearning maximizes prediction uncertainty on forgotten data, achieving genuine forgetting rather than confident misprediction, and 2) Gradient orthogonal projection eliminates interference by projecting forgetting gradients onto the orthogonal complement of retain gradients, providing theoretical guarantees for utility preservation under first-order approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OEU outperforms existing methods in both forgetting effectiveness and retain accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00573v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially learn new classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Conventional CIL approaches implicitly assume that classes are morphologically static, focusing primarily on preserving previously learned representations as new classes are introduced. However, this assumption neglects intra-class evolution: a phenomenon wherein instances of the same semantic class undergo significant morphological transformations, such as a larva turning into a butterfly. Consequently, a model must both discriminate between classes and adapt to evolving appearances within a single class. To systematically address this challenge, we formalize Stage-Aware CIL (Stage-CIL), a paradigm in which each class is learned progressively through distinct morphological stages. To facilitate rigorous evaluation within this paradigm, we introduce the Stage-Bench, a 10-domain, 2-stages dataset and protocol that jointly measure inter- and intra-class forgetting. We further propose STAGE, a novel method that explicitly learns abstract and transferable evolution patterns within a fixed-size memory pool. By decoupling semantic identity from transformation dynamics, STAGE enables accurate prediction of future morphologies based on earlier representations. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that STAGE consistently and substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in simultaneously addressing inter-class discrimination and intra-class morphological adaptation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00576v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can modifying the training data distribution guide optimizers toward solutions with improved generalization when training large language models (LLMs)? In this work, we theoretically analyze an in-context linear regression model with multi-head linear self-attention, and compare the training dynamics of two gradient based optimizers, namely gradient descent (GD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), the latter exhibiting superior generalization properties but is prohibitively expensive for training even medium-sized LLMs. We show, for the first time, that SAM induces a lower simplicity bias (SB)-the tendency of an optimizer to preferentially learn simpler features earlier in training-and identify this reduction as a key factor underlying its improved generalization performance. Motivated by this insight, we demonstrate that altering the training data distribution by upsampling or augmenting examples learned later in training similarly reduces SB and leads to improved generalization. Our extensive experiments show that our strategy improves the performance of multiple LLMs-including Phi2-2.7B , Llama3.2-1B, Gemma3-1B-PT, and Qwen3-0.6B-Base-achieving relative accuracy gains up to 18% when fine-tuned with AdamW and Muon on mathematical reasoning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inevitably memorize sensitive information during training, posing significant privacy risks. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution to selectively remove such information without full retraining. However, existing methods are designed for dense models and overlook model sparsification-an essential technique for efficient LLM deployment. We find that unlearning effectiveness degrades substantially on sparse models. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that this degradation occurs because existing unlearning methods require updating all parameters, yet sparsification prunes substantial weights to zero, fundamentally limiting the model's forgetting capacity. To address this challenge, we propose Sparsity-Aware Unlearning (SAU), which decouples unlearning from sparsification objectives through gradient masking that redirects updates to surviving weights, combined with importance-aware redistribution to compensate for pruned parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAU significantly outperforms existing methods on sparse LLMs, achieving effective forgetting while preserving model utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series forecasting (IMTSF) is challenging due to non-uniform sampling and variable asynchronicity. These irregularities violate the equidistant assumptions of standard models, hindering local temporal modeling and rendering classical frequency-domain methods ineffective for capturing global periodic structures. To address this challenge, we propose TFMixer, a joint time-frequency modeling framework for IMTS forecasting. Specifically, TFMixer incorporates a Global Frequency Module that employs a learnable Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform (NUDFT) to directly extract spectral representations from irregular timestamps. In parallel, the Local Time Module introduces a query-based patch mixing mechanism to adaptively aggregate informative temporal patches and alleviate information density imbalance. Finally, TFMixer fuses the time-domain and frequency-domain representations to generate forecasts and further leverages inverse NUDFT for explicit seasonal extrapolation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the state--of-the-art performance of TFMixer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00587v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Balancing reward and safety in constrained reinforcement learning remains challenging due to poor generalization from sharp value minima and inadequate handling of heavy-tailed risk distribution. We introduce Safe Langevin Soft Actor-Critic (SL-SAC), a principled algorithm that addresses both issues through parameter-space exploration and distributional risk control. Our approach combines three key mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (aSGLD) for reward critics, promoting ensemble diversity and escape from poor optima; (2) distributional cost estimation via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization for tail-risk mitigation; and (3) a reactive Lagrangian relaxation scheme that adapts constraint enforcement based on the empirical CVaR of episodic costs. We provide theoretical guarantees on CVaR estimation error and demonstrate that CVaR-based Lagrange updates yield stronger constraint violation signals than expected-cost updates. On Safety-Gymnasium benchmarks, SL-SAC achieves the lowest cost in 7 out of 10 tasks while maintaining competitive returns, with cost reductions of 19-63% in velocity tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00589v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in many fields that require accurate predictions for decision-making. Patching techniques, commonly used and effective in time series modeling, help capture temporal dependencies by dividing the data into patches. However, existing patch-based methods fail to dynamically select patches and typically use all patches during the prediction process. In real-world time series, there are often low-quality issues during data collection, such as missing values, distribution shifts, anomalies and white noise, which may cause some patches to contain low-quality information, negatively impacting the prediction results. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust time series forecasting framework called SEER. Firstly, we propose an Augmented Embedding Module, which improves patch-wise representations using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and obtains series-wise token representations through a channel-adaptive perception mechanism. Secondly, we introduce a Learnable Patch Replacement Module, which enhances forecasting robustness and model accuracy through a two-stage process: 1) a dynamic filtering mechanism eliminates negative patch-wise tokens; 2) a replaced attention module substitutes the identified low-quality patches with global series-wise token, further refining their representations through a causal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the SOTA performance of SEER.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00596v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) aim to capture the evolving structure and timing of interactions in dynamic graphs. Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The class of direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms has emerged as a promising approach for solving the alignment problem in foundation models. These algorithms work with very limited feedback in the form of pairwise preferences and fine-tune models to align with these preferences without explicitly learning a reward model. While the form of feedback used by these algorithms makes the data collection process easy and relatively more accurate, its ambiguity in terms of the quality of responses could have negative implications. For example, it is not clear if a decrease (increase) in the likelihood of preferred (dispreferred) responses during the execution of these algorithms could be interpreted as a positive or negative phenomenon. In this paper, we study how to design algorithms that can leverage additional information in the form of rating gap, which informs the learner how much the chosen response is better than the rejected one. We present new algorithms that can achieve faster statistical rates than DPO in presence of accurate rating gap information. Moreover, we theoretically prove and empirically show that the performance of our algorithms is robust to inaccuracy in rating gaps. Finally, we demonstrate the solid performance of our methods in comparison to a number of DPO-style algorithms across a wide range of LLMs and evaluation benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a novel independent and payoff-based learning framework for stochastic games that is model-free, game-agnostic, and gradient-free. The learning dynamics follow a best-response-type actor-critic architecture, where agents update their strategies (actors) using feedback from two distinct critics: a fast critic that intuitively responds to observed payoffs under limited information, and a slow critic that deliberatively approximates the solution to the underlying dynamic programming problem. Crucially, the learning process relies on non-equilibrium adaptation through smoothed best responses to observed payoffs. We establish convergence to (approximate) equilibria in two-agent zero-sum and multi-agent identical-interest stochastic games over an infinite horizon. This provides one of the first payoff-based and fully decentralized learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees in both settings. Empirical results further validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach across both classes of games.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00620v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The zero-shot evaluation of time series foundation models (TSFMs) for classification typically uses a frozen encoder followed by a task-specific classifier. However, this practice violates the training-free premise of zero-shot deployment and introduces evaluation bias due to classifier-dependent training choices. To address this issue, we propose TIC-FM, an in-context learning framework that treats the labeled training set as context and predicts labels for all test instances in a single forward pass, without parameter updates. TIC-FM pairs a time series encoder and a lightweight projection adapter with a split-masked latent memory Transformer. We further provide theoretical justification that in-context inference can subsume trained classifiers and can emulate gradient-based classifier training within a single forward pass. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets show strong accuracy, with consistent gains in the extreme low-label situation, highlighting training-free transfer

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00624v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) supports critical applications such as traffic-flow management, solar-power scheduling, and electricity-transformer monitoring. The existing LTSF paradigms follow a three-stage pipeline of embedding, backbone refinement, and long-horizon prediction. However, the behaviors of individual backbone layers remain underexplored. We introduce layer sensitivity, a gradient-based metric inspired by GradCAM and effective receptive field theory, which quantifies both positive and negative contributions of each time point to a layer's latent features. Applying this metric to a three-layer MLP backbone reveals depth-specific specialization in modeling temporal dynamics in the input sequence. Motivated by these insights, we propose MoDEx, a lightweight Mixture of Depth-specific Experts, which replaces complex backbones with depth-specific MLP experts. MoDEx achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world benchmarks, ranking first in 78 percent of cases, while using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. It also integrates seamlessly into transformer variants, consistently boosting their performance and demonstrating robust generalizability as an efficient and high-performance LTSF framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00628v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate the extent to which an LLM's hidden-state geometry can be recovered from its behavior in psycholinguistic experiments. Across eight instruction-tuned transformer models, we run two experimental paradigms -- similarity-based forced choice and free association -- over a shared 5,000-word vocabulary, collecting 17.5M+ trials to build behavior-based similarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry. Finally, we discuss implications for the ability of behavioral tasks to uncover hidden cognitive states.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00636v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring the safety of environmental exploration is a critical problem in reinforcement learning (RL). While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00640v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has been widely used to optimize expensive and black-box functions across various domains. Existing BO methods have not addressed tensor-output functions. To fill this gap, we propose a novel tensor-output BO method. Specifically, we first introduce a tensor-output Gaussian process (TOGP) with two classes of tensor-output kernels as a surrogate model of the tensor-output function, which can effectively capture the structural dependencies within the tensor. Based on it, we develop an upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function to select the queried points. Furthermore, we introduce a more complex and practical problem setting, named combinatorial bandit Bayesian optimization (CBBO), where only a subset of the outputs can be selected to contribute to the objective function. To tackle this, we propose a tensor-output CBBO method, which extends TOGP to handle partially observed outputs, and accordingly design a novel combinatorial multi-arm bandit-UCB2 (CMAB-UCB2) criterion to sequentially select both the queried points and the optimal output subset. Theoretical regret bounds for the two methods are established, ensuring their sublinear performance. Extensive synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate their superiority.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00647v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the proliferation of distributed data sources, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key approach to enable collaborative intelligence through decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. However, conventional FL algorithms often suffer from performance disparities across clients caused by heterogeneous data distributions and unequal participation, which leads to unfair outcomes. Specifically, we focus on two core fairness challenges, i.e., representation bias, arising from misaligned client representations, and collaborative bias, stemming from inequitable contribution during aggregation, both of which degrade model performance and generalizability. To mitigate these disparities, we propose CoRe-Fed, a unified optimization framework that bridges collaborative and representation fairness via embedding-level regularization and fairness-aware aggregation. Initially, an alignment-driven mechanism promotes semantic consistency between local and global embeddings to reduce representational divergence. Subsequently, a dynamic reward-penalty-based aggregation strategy adjusts each client's weight based on participation history and embedding alignment to ensure contribution-aware aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that CoRe-Fed improves both fairness and model performance over the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00654v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While existing multivariate time series forecasting models have advanced significantly in modeling periodicity, they largely neglect the periodic heterogeneity common in real-world data, where variates exhibit distinct and dynamically changing periods. To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivariate inputs into a three-dimensional "periodic bucket" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variate group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids interference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical explanation is provided to support this property. We evaluate PHAT comprehensively on 14 real-world datasets against 18 baselines, and the results show that it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving highly competitive forecasting performance. Our sources is available at GitHub.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00656v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) typically uses adversarial learning to align graph embeddings in Euclidean space. However, this paradigm suffers from two critical challenges: Structural Degeneration, where hierarchical and semantic representations are entangled, and Optimization Instability, which arises from oscillatory dynamics of minimax adversarial training. To tackle these issues, we propose DisRFM, a geometry-aware GDA framework that unifies Riemannian embedding and flow-based transport. First, to overcome structural degeneration, we embed graphs into a Riemannian manifold. By adopting polar coordinates, we explicitly disentangle structure (radius) from semantics (angle). Then, we enforce topology preservation through radial Wasserstein alignment and semantic discrimination via angular clustering, thereby preventing feature entanglement and collapse. Second, we address the instability of adversarial alignment by using Riemannian flow matching. This method learns a smooth vector field to guide source features toward the target along geodesic paths, guaranteeing stable convergence. The geometric constraints further guide the flow to maintain the disentangled structure during transport. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic stability of the flow matching and derive a tighter bound for the target risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisRFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00670v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used technique for measuring brain activity. EEG-based signals can reveal a persons emotional state, as they directly reflect activity in different brain regions. Emotion-aware systems and EEG-based emotion recognition are a growing research area. This paper presents how machine learning (ML) models categorize a limited dataset of EEG signals into three different classes, namely Negative, Neutral, or Positive. It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00672v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Research in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has largely focused on developing increasingly sophisticated, hard-to-train, and expensive-to-infer neural architectures. We revisit this paradigm and show that a simple linear autoregressive anomaly score with the closed-form solution provided by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art deep detectors. From a theoretical perspective, we show that linear models capture a broad class of anomaly types, estimating a finite-history Gaussian process conditional density. From a practical side, across extensive univariate and multivariate benchmarks, the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources. Thus, future research should consistently include strong linear baselines and, more importantly, develop new benchmarks with richer temporal structures pinpointing the advantages of deep learning models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00688v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on sensitive datasets raises privacy concerns, as training data extraction (TDE) attacks can expose highly confidential information. Existing defenses against such attacks either lack formal privacy guarantees or incur substantial utility degradation. We observe that fine-tuning induces widespread probability shifts, yet preserving only a small subset of influential token-level deviations is sufficient; the remaining shifts can be aggressively smoothed with minimal impact on utility. Motivated by this insight, we propose SCP-$\Delta_r$, a Near Access Freeness (NAF)-based algorithm that operates on relative probabilities and explicitly smooths low-impact tokens using a base model. SCP-$\Delta_r$ achieves orders-of-magnitude better theoretical bounds than existing NAF based methods and provides strong empirical protection against TDE attacks with minimal performance loss.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding the properties of the parameter space in feed-forward ReLU networks is critical for effectively analyzing and guiding training dynamics. After initialization, training under gradient flow decisively restricts the parameter space to an algebraic variety that emerges from the homogeneous nature of the ReLU activation function. In this study, we examine two key challenges associated with feed-forward ReLU networks built on general directed acyclic graph (DAG) architectures: the (dis)connectedness of the parameter space and the existence of singularities within it. We extend previous results by providing a thorough characterization of connectedness, highlighting the roles of bottleneck nodes and balance conditions associated with specific subsets of the network. Our findings clearly demonstrate that singularities are intricately connected to the topology of the underlying DAG and its induced sub-networks. We discuss the reachability of these singularities and establish a principled connection with differentiable pruning. We validate our theory with simple numerical experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Local Energy Communities are emerging as crucial players in the landscape of sustainable development. A significant challenge for these communities is achieving self-sufficiency through effective management of the balance between energy production and consumption. To meet this challenge, it is essential to develop and implement forecasting models that deliver accurate predictions, which can then be utilized by optimization and planning algorithms. However, the application of forecasting solutions is often hindered by privacy constrains and regulations as the users participating in the Local Energy Community can be (rightfully) reluctant sharing their consumption patterns with others. In this context, the use of Federated Learning (FL) can be a viable solution as it allows to create a forecasting model without the need to share privacy sensitive information among the users. In this study, we demonstrate how FL and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can be employed to achieve this objective, highlighting the trade-off between data sharing and forecasting accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00704v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The generation of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code is a crucial yet labor-intensive step in digital hardware design, traditionally requiring engineers to manually translate complex specifications into thousands of lines of synthesizable Hardware Description Language (HDL) code. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process, existing approaches-including fine-tuned domain-specific models and advanced agent-based systems-struggle to scale to industrial IP-level design tasks. We identify three key challenges: (1) handling long, highly detailed documents, where critical interface constraints become buried in unrelated submodule descriptions; (2) generating long RTL code, where both syntactic and semantic correctness degrade sharply with increasing output length; and (3) navigating the complex debugging cycles required for functional verification through simulation and waveform analysis. To overcome these challenges, we propose LocalV, a multi-agent framework that leverages information locality in modular hardware design. LocalV decomposes the long-document to long-code generation problem into a set of short-document, short-code tasks, enabling scalable generation and debugging. Specifically, LocalV integrates hierarchical document partitioning, task planning, localized code generation, interface-consistent merging, and AST-guided locality-aware debugging. Experiments on RealBench, an IP-level Verilog generation benchmark, demonstrate that LocalV substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and agents, achieving a pass rate of 45.0% compared to 21.6%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00717v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep time-series forecasting can be formulated as a distribution balancing problem aimed at aligning the distribution of the forecasts and ground truths. According to Imbens' criterion, true distribution balance requires matching the first moments with respect to any balancing function. We demonstrate that existing objectives fail to meet this criterion, as they enforce moment matching only for one or two predefined balancing functions, thus failing to achieve full distribution balance. To address this limitation, we propose direct forecasting with kernelized moment balancing (KMB-DF). Unlike existing objectives, KMB-DF adaptively selects the most informative balancing functions from a reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) to enforce sufficient distribution balancing. We derive a tractable and differentiable objective that enables efficient estimation from empirical samples and seamless integration into gradient-based training pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets show that KMB-DF consistently improves forecasting accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this survey, we delineate a comprehensive classification of the state-of-the-art fairness-aware approaches from a multifaceted perspective, i.e., model performance-oriented and capability-oriented. Moreover, we provide a framework to categorize and address various fairness concerns and associated technical aspects, examining their effectiveness in balancing equity and performance within FL frameworks. We further examine several significant evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness quantitatively. Finally, we explore exciting open research directions and propose prospective solutions that could drive future advancements in this important area, laying a solid foundation for researchers working toward fairness in FL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-efficient continual learning aims to adapt pre-trained models to sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Most existing approaches treat continual learning as avoiding interference with past updates, rather than considering what properties make the current task-specific update naturally preserve previously acquired knowledge. From a knowledge-decomposition perspective, we observe that low-rank adaptations exhibit highly imbalanced singular value spectra: a few dominant components absorb most of the adaptation energy, thereby (i) more likely to disrupt previously acquired knowledge and (ii) making the update more vulnerable to interference from subsequent tasks. To enable explicit balance among components, we decouple the magnitude of the task update from its directional structure and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem on a restricted Stiefel manifold. We address this problem using a projected first-order method compatible with standard deep-learning optimizers used in vision-language models. Our method mitigates both backward and forward forgetting, consistently outperforming continual learning baselines. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/haodotgu/EBLoRA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to "hallucinate" by generating false or misleading outputs. Hallucinations pose various harms, from erosion of trust to widespread misinformation. Existing hallucination evaluation, however, focuses only on correctness and often overlooks consistency, necessary to distinguish and address these harms. To bridge this gap, we introduce prompt multiplicity, a framework for quantifying consistency in LLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant multiplicity (over 50% inconsistency in benchmarks like Med-HALT), suggesting that hallucination-related harms have been severely misunderstood. Furthermore, we study the role of consistency in hallucination detection and mitigation. We find that: (a) detection techniques detect consistency, not correctness, and (b) mitigation techniques like RAG, while beneficial, can introduce additional inconsistencies. By integrating prompt multiplicity into hallucination evaluation, we provide an improved framework of potential harms and uncover critical limitations in current detection and mitigation strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00737v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) arises in many real-world applications where trade-offs between competing objectives must be carefully balanced. In the offline setting, where only a static dataset is available, the main challenge is generalizing beyond observed data. We introduce Pareto-Conditioned Diffusion (PCD), a novel framework that formulates offline MOO as a conditional sampling problem. By conditioning directly on desired trade-offs, PCD avoids the need for explicit surrogate models. To effectively explore the Pareto front, PCD employs a reweighting strategy that focuses on high-performing samples and a reference-direction mechanism to guide sampling towards novel, promising regions beyond the training data. Experiments on standard offline MOO benchmarks show that PCD achieves highly competitive performance and, importantly, demonstrates greater consistency across diverse tasks than existing offline MOO approaches.

Recent work on interpolation-based methods, particularly Non-Negative Kernel regression (NNK), has demonstrated that predictions can be expressed as convex combinations of similar training examples in the embedding space, yielding both theoretical results and interpretable explanations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00767v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emergent misalignment can arise when a language model is fine-tuned on a narrowly scoped supervised objective: the model learns the target behavior, yet also develops undesirable out-of-domain behaviors. We investigate a mechanistic approach to preventing emergent misalignment by identifying a small set of internal features that reliably control the misaligned behavior and then discouraging the model from strengthening these features during fine-tuning. Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect. Overall, our results show that targeted training-time constraints on internal mechanisms can mitigate emergent misalignment without degrading target-task performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00772v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing prevalence of unauthorized model usage and misattribution has increased the need for reliable model provenance analysis. However, existing methods largely rely on heuristic fingerprint-matching rules that lack provable error control and often overlook the existence of multiple sources, leaving the reliability of their provenance claims unverified. In this work, we first formalize the model provenance problem with provable guarantees, requiring rigorous coverage of all true provenances at a prescribed confidence level. Then, we propose the Model Provenance Set (MPS), which employs a sequential test-and-exclusion procedure to adaptively construct a small set satisfying the guarantee. The key idea of MPS is to test the significance of provenance existence within a candidate pool, thereby establishing a provable asymptotic guarantee at a user-specific confidence level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPS effectively achieves target provenance coverage while strictly limiting the inclusion of unrelated models, and further reveal its potential for practical provenance analysis in attribution and auditing tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Against the backdrop of the global green transition and "dual carbon" goals, mining industry chain enterprises are pivotal entities in terms of resource consumption and environmental impact. Their environmental performance directly affects regional ecological security and is closely tied to national resource strategies and green transformation outcomes. Ensuring the authenticity and reliability of their environmental disclosure is thus a core and urgent issue for sustainable development and national strategic objectives.From a corporate governance perspective, this study examines equity balance as a fundamental governance mechanism, investigating its inhibitory effect on greenwashing behavior among these enterprises and the underlying pathways involved. Methodologically, the paper innovatively employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Double Machine Learning (DML) model to construct counterfactual scenarios, mitigating endogeneity concerns and precisely identifying the causal relationship between equity balance and greenwashing. The findings indicate, first, a significant negative causal relationship between equity balance and corporate greenwashing, confirming its substantive governance effect. Second, this inhibitory effect exhibits notable heterogeneity, manifesting more strongly in western regions, upstream segments of the industrial chain, and industries with high environmental sensitivity. Third, the governance effect demonstrates clear temporal dynamics, with the strongest impact occurring in the current period, followed by a diminishing yet statistically significant lagged effect, and ultimately a stable long-term cumulative influence. Finally, mechanism analysis reveals that equity balance operates through three distinct channels to curb greenwashing: alleviating management performance pressure, enhancing the stability of the executive team, and intensifying media scrutiny.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Against the backdrop of ongoing carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, accurate prediction of enterprise carbon emission trends constitutes an essential foundation for energy structure optimization and low-carbon transformation decision-making. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity persists across regions, industries and individual enterprises regarding energy structure, production scale, policy intensity and governance efficacy, resulting in pronounced distribution shifts and non-stationarity in carbon emission data across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Such cross-regional and cross-enterprise data drift not only compromises the accuracy of carbon emission reporting but substantially undermines the guidance value of predictive models for production planning and carbon quota trading decisions. To address this critical challenge, we integrate causal inference perspectives with stable learning methodologies and time-series modelling, proposing a stable temporal prediction mechanism tailored to distribution shift environments. This mechanism incorporates enterprise-level energy inputs, capital investment, labour deployment, carbon pricing, governmental interventions and policy implementation intensity, constructing a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features (robust against external perturbations yet demonstrating long-term stable effects on carbon dioxide emissions) from multi-environment samples across diverse policies, regions and industrial sectors. Furthermore, through adaptive normalization and sample reweighting strategies, the approach dynamically rectifies temporal non-stationarity induced by economic fluctuations and policy transitions, ultimately enhancing model generalization capability and explainability in complex environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in non-episodic, finite-horizon MDPs remains underexplored and is challenged by the need to estimate returns to a fixed terminal time. Existing infinite-horizon methods, which often rely on discounted contraction, do not naturally account for this fixed-horizon structure. We introduce a modified Q-function: rather than targeting the full-horizon, we learn a K-step lookahead Q-function that truncates planning to the next K steps. To further improve sample efficiency, we introduce a thresholding mechanism: actions are selected only when their estimated K-step lookahead value exceeds a time-varying threshold. We provide an efficient tabular learning algorithm for this novel objective, proving it achieves fast finite-sample convergence: it achieves minimax optimal constant regret for $K=1$ and $\mathcal{O}(\max((K-1),C_{K-1})\sqrt{SAT\log(T)})$ regret for any $K \geq 2$. We numerically evaluate the performance of our algorithm under the objective of maximizing reward. Our implementation adaptively increases K over time, balancing lookahead depth against estimation variance. Empirical results demonstrate superior cumulative rewards over state-of-the-art tabular RL methods across synthetic MDPs and RL environments: JumpRiverswim, FrozenLake and AnyTrading.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00788v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) accelerates the search for the global optimum of black-box functions by integrating inexpensive, low-fidelity approximations. The central task of an MFBO policy is to balance the cost-efficiency of low-fidelity proxies against their reduced accuracy to ensure effective progression toward the high-fidelity optimum. Existing MFBO methods primarily capture associational dependencies between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, rather than causal mechanisms, and can perform poorly when lower-fidelity proxies are poorly aligned with the target fidelity. We propose RESCUE (REducing Sampling cost with Causal Understanding and Estimation), a multi-objective MFBO method that incorporates causal calculus to systematically address this challenge. RESCUE learns a structural causal model capturing causal relationships between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, and uses it to construct a probabilistic multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate that encodes intervention effects. Exploiting the causal structure, we introduce a causal hypervolume knowledge-gradient acquisition strategy to select input-fidelity pairs that balance expected multi-objective improvement and cost. We show that RESCUE improves sample efficiency over state-of-the-art MF optimization methods on synthetic and real-world problems in robotics, machine learning (AutoML), and healthcare.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables clients with local data to collaborate in a peer-to-peer manner to train a generalized model. In this paper, we unify two branches of work that have separately solved important challenges in DFL: (i) gradient tracking techniques for mitigating data heterogeneity and (ii) accounting for diverse availability of resources across clients. We propose $\textit{Sporadic Gradient Tracking}$ ($\texttt{Spod-GT}$), the first DFL algorithm that incorporates these factors over general directed graphs by allowing (i) client-specific gradient computation frequencies and (ii) heterogeneous and asymmetric communication frequencies. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of our methodology with relaxed assumptions on gradient estimation variance and gradient diversity of clients, providing consensus and optimality guarantees for GT over directed graphs despite intermittent client participation. Through numerical experiments on image classification datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{Spod-GT}$ compared to well-known GT baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked discrete diffusion is a dominant paradigm for high-quality language modeling where tokens are iteratively corrupted to a mask state, yet its inference efficiency is bottlenecked by the lack of deterministic sampling tools. While diffusion duality enables deterministic distillation for uniform models, these approaches generally underperform masked models and rely on complex integral operators. Conversely, in the masked domain, prior methods typically assume the absence of deterministic trajectories, forcing a reliance on stochastic distillation. To bridge this gap, we establish explicit Masked Diffusion Duality, proving that the masked process arises as the projection of a continuous Gaussian process via a novel maximum-value index preservation mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Masked Consistency Distillation (MCD), a principled framework that leverages this duality to analytically construct the deterministic coupled trajectories required for consistency distillation, bypassing numerical ODE solvers. This result strictly improves upon prior stochastic distillation methods, achieving a 16$\times$ inference speedup without compromising generation quality. Our findings not only provide a solid theoretical foundation connecting masked and continuous diffusion, but also unlock the full potential of consistency distillation for high-performance discrete generation. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MCD-70FD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs have traditionally scaled along dense dimensions, where performance is coupled with near-linear increases in computational cost. While MoE decouples capacity from compute, it introduces large memory overhead and hardware efficiency challenges. To overcome these, we propose token-indexed parameters as a novel, orthogonal scaling axis that decouple model capacity from FLOPs. Specifically, we introduce Joint-Token (JTok) and Mixture of Joint-Token (JTok-M), which augment Transformer layers with modulation vectors retrieved from auxiliary embedding tables. These vectors modulate the backbone via lightweight, element-wise operations, incurring negligible FLOPs overhead. Extensive experiments on both dense and MoE backbones, spanning from 650M (190M + 460M embedding) to 61B (17B + 44B embedding) total parameters, demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces validation loss and significantly improves downstream task performance (e.g., +4.1 on MMLU, +8.3 on ARC, +8.9 on CEval). Rigorous isoFLOPs analysis further confirms that JTok-M fundamentally shifts the quality-compute Pareto frontier, achieving comparable model quality with 35% less compute relative to vanilla MoE architectures, and we validate that token-indexed parameters exhibit a predictable power-law scaling behavior. Moreover, our efficient implementation ensures that the overhead introduced by JTok and JTok-M remains marginal.

Human activity recognition is increasingly used for games, medical, or surveillance. In this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept 2D endless game called Duck Catch & Fit, which implements a detailed activity recognition system that uses a smartphone accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors. The system applies feature extraction and learning mechanism to detect human activities like staying, side movements, and fake side movements. In addition, a voice recognition system is combined to recognize the word "fire" and raise the game's complexity. The results show that it is possible to use machine learning techniques to recognize human activity with high recognition levels. Also, the combination of movement-based and voice-based integrations contributes to a more immersive gameplay.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00827v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Feature learning strength (FLS), i.e., the inverse of the effective output scaling of a model, plays a critical role in shaping the optimization dynamics of neural nets. While its impact has been extensively studied under the asymptotic regimes -- both in training time and FLS -- existing theory offers limited insight into how FLS affects generalization in practical settings, such as when training is stopped upon reaching a target training risk. In this work, we investigate the impact of FLS on generalization in deep networks under such practical conditions. Through empirical studies, we first uncover the emergence of an $\textit{optimal FLS}$ -- neither too small nor too large -- that yields substantial generalization gains. This finding runs counter to the prevailing intuition that stronger feature learning universally improves generalization. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics in two-layer ReLU nets trained with logistic loss, where FLS is controlled via initialization scale. Our main theoretical result establishes the existence of an optimal FLS arising from a trade-off between two competing effects: An excessively large FLS induces an $\textit{over-alignment}$ phenomenon that degrades generalization, while an overly small FLS leads to $\textit{over-fitting}$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Score-based methods have emerged as a powerful framework for density ratio estimation (DRE), but they face an important paradox in that, while theoretically path-independent, their practical performance depends critically on the chosen path schedule. We resolve this issue by proving that tractable training objectives differ from the ideal, ground-truth objective by a crucial, overlooked term: the path variance of the time score. To address this, we propose MinPV (\textbf{Min}imum \textbf{P}ath \textbf{V}ariance) Principle, which introduces a principled heuristic to minimize the overlooked path variance. Our key contribution is the derivation of a closed-form expression for the variance, turning an intractable problem into a tractable optimization. By parameterizing the path with a flexible Kumaraswamy Mixture Model, our method learns a data-adaptive, low-variance path without heuristic selection. This principled optimization of the complete objective yields more accurate and stable estimators, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.

We address this issue by introducing RMFlow, an efficient multimodal generative model that integrates a coarse 1-NFE MeanFlow transport with a subsequent tailored noise-injection refinement step. RMFlow approximates the average velocity of the flow path using a neural network trained with a new loss function that balances minimizing the Wasserstein distance between probability paths and maximizing sample likelihood. RMFlow achieves near state-of-the-art results on text-to-image, context-to-molecule, and time-series generation using only 1-NFE, at a computational cost comparable to the baseline MeanFlows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00852v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Subtask distillation is an emerging paradigm in which compact, specialized models are extracted from large, general-purpose 'foundation models' for deployment in environments with limited resources or in standalone computer systems. Although distillation uses a teacher model, it still relies on a dataset that is often limited in size and may lack representativeness or exhibit spurious correlations. In this paper, we evaluate established distillation methods, as well as the recent SubDistill method, when using data with spurious correlations for distillation. As the strength of the correlations increases, we observe a widening gap between advanced methods, such as SubDistill, which remain fairly robust, and some baseline methods, which degrade to near-random performance. Overall, our study underscores the challenges of knowledge distillation when applied to imperfect, real-world datasets, particularly those with spurious correlations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning protein structures by capturing spatial relationships at the residue level. However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00869v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) stands out as an efficient, simulation-free approach for training flow-based generative models, achieving remarkable performance for data generation. However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study solution learning for heat-based equations in self-similar variables (SSV). We develop an SSV training framework compatible with standard neural-operator training. We instantiate this framework on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, and perform controlled comparisons between models trained in physical coordinates and in the corresponding self-similar coordinates using two simple fully connected architectures (standard multilayer perceptrons and a factorized fully connected network). Across both systems and both architectures, SSV-trained networks consistently deliver substantially more accurate and stable extrapolation beyond the training window and better capture qualitative long-time trends. These results suggest that self-similar coordinates provide a mathematically motivated inductive bias for learning the long-time dynamics of heat-based equations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Among parallel decoding paradigms, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising candidate that balances generation quality and throughput. However, their integration with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is constrained by an expert explosion: as the number of tokens generated in parallel increases, the number of distinct experts activated grows nearly linearly. This results in substantial memory traffic that pushes inference into a memory-bound regime, negating the efficiency gains of both MoE and parallel decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Expert Sharing (DES), a novel technique that shifts MoE optimization from token-centric pruning and conventional expert skipping methods to sequence-level coreset selection. To maximize expert reuse, DES identifies a compact, high-utility set of experts to satisfy the requirements of an entire parallel decoding block. We introduce two innovative selection strategies: (1) Intra-Sequence Sharing (DES-Seq), which adapts optimal allocation to the sequence level, and (2) Saliency-Aware Voting (DES-Vote), a novel mechanism that allows tokens to collectively elect a coreset based on aggregated router weights. Extensive experiments on MoE dLLMs demonstrate that DES reduces unique expert activations by over 55% and latency by up to 38%, while retaining 99% of vanilla accuracy, effectively decoupling memory overhead from the degree of parallelism.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00884v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural operators have shown promise in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but they often struggle to generalize when test inputs lie outside the training distribution, such as novel initial conditions, unseen PDE coefficients or unseen physics. Prior works address this limitation with large-scale multiple physics pretraining followed by fine-tuning, but this still requires examples from the new dynamics, falling short of true zero-shot generalization. In this work, we propose a method to enhance generalization at test time, i.e., without modifying pretrained weights. Building on DISCO, which provides a dictionary of neural operators trained across different dynamics, we introduce a neural operator splitting strategy that, at test time, searches over compositions of training operators to approximate unseen dynamics. On challenging out-of-distribution tasks including parameter extrapolation and novel combinations of physics phenomena, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization results, while being able to recover the underlying PDE parameters. These results underscore test-time computation as a key avenue for building flexible, compositional, and generalizable neural operators.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Informative data selection is a key requirement for large language models (LLMs) to minimize the amount of data required for fine-tuning, network distillation, and token pruning, enabling fast and efficient deployment, especially under computational and communication constraints. Traditional subset selection methods, including those based on Determinantal Point Processes (DPP), focus on maximizing diversity but assume that selected data batches are always available error-free. This presumption prohibits their use under partial storage outage, imperfect communication, and stochastic access failures. Furthermore, we show that the original formulation collapses under such conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ProbDPP, a novel reliability-aware implementation of k-DPP that accounts for probabilistic data access by recasting the objective function with a regularization term that remains well-posed and decomposes into a geometric diversity term and unreliability cost. The resulting objective facilitates robust selection of diverse data batches under uncertainty. Furthermore, we frame this reliability-aware diversity maximization as a combinatorial semi-bandit problem and propose a UCB-style algorithm to efficiently learn the unknown reliability online. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds for the proposed approach, ensuring performance guarantees.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advent of the web has led to a paradigm shift in the financial relations, with the real-time dissemination of news, social discourse, and financial filings contributing significantly to the reshaping of financial forecasting. The existing methods rely on establishing relations a priori, i.e. predefining graphs to capture inter-stock relationships. However, the stock-related web signals are characterised by high levels of noise, asynchrony, and challenging to obtain, resulting in poor generalisability and non-alignment between the predefined graphs and the downstream tasks. To address this, we propose GAPNet, a Graph Adaptation Plug-in Network that jointly learns task-specific topology and representations in an end-to-end manner. GAPNet attaches to existing pairwise graph or hypergraph backbone models, enabling the dynamic adaptation and rewiring of edge topologies via two complementary components: a Spatial Perception Layer that captures short-term co-movements across assets, and a Temporal Perception Layer that maintains long-term dependency under distribution shift. Across two real-world stock datasets, GAPNet has been shown to consistently enhance the profitability and stability in comparision to the state-of-the-art models, yielding annualised cumulative returns of up to 0.47 for RT-GCN and 0.63 for CI-STHPAN, with peak Sharpe Ratio of 2.20 and 2.12 respectively. The plug-and-play design of GAPNet ensures its broad applicability to diverse GNN-based architectures. Our results underscore that jointly learning graph structures and representations is essential for task-specific relational modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: E-commerce recommendation and search commonly rely on sparse keyword matching (e.g., BM25), which breaks down under vocabulary mismatch when user intent has limited lexical overlap with product metadata. We cast content-based recommendation as recommendation-as-retrieval: given a natural-language intent signal (a query or review), retrieve the top-K most relevant items from a large catalog via semantic similarity.   We present a scalable dense retrieval system based on a two-tower bi-encoder, fine-tuned on the Amazon Reviews 2023 (Fashion) subset using supervised contrastive learning with Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss. We construct training pairs from review text (as a query proxy) and item metadata (as the positive document) and fine-tune on 50,000 sampled interactions with a maximum sequence length of 500 tokens.   For efficient serving, we combine FAISS HNSW indexing with an ONNX Runtime inference pipeline using INT8 dynamic quantization. On a review-to-title benchmark over 826,402 catalog items, our approach improves Recall@10 from 0.26 (BM25) to 0.66, while meeting practical latency and model-size constraints: 6.1 ms median CPU inference latency (batch size 1) and a 4x reduction in model size.   Overall, we provide an end-to-end, reproducible blueprint for taking domain-adapted dense retrieval from offline training to CPU-efficient serving at catalog scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00906v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00907v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: PyGALAX is a Python package for geospatial analysis that integrates automated machine learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to analyze spatial heterogeneity in both regression and classification tasks. It automatically selects and optimizes machine learning models for different geographic locations and contexts while maintaining interpretability through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. PyGALAX builds upon and improves the GALAX framework (Geospatial Analysis Leveraging AutoML and eXplainable AI), which has proven to outperform traditional geographically weighted regression (GWR) methods. Critical enhancements in PyGALAX from the original GALAX framework include automatic bandwidth selection and flexible kernel function selection, providing greater flexibility and robustness for spatial modeling across diverse datasets and research questions. PyGALAX not only inherits all the functionalities of the original GALAX framework but also packages them into an accessible, reproducible, and easily deployable Python toolkit while providing additional options for spatial modeling. It effectively addresses spatial non-stationarity and generates transparent insights into complex spatial relationships at both global and local scales, making advanced geospatial machine learning methods accessible to researchers and practitioners in geography, urban planning, environmental science, and related fields.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00910v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, playing a vital role in modern clinical applications. However, the deployment of large-scale models in real-world clinical settings remains challenging due to high computational costs, latency constraints, and patient data privacy concerns associated with cloud-based processing. To address these bottlenecks, this review provides a comprehensive synthesis of efficient and lightweight deep learning architectures specifically tailored for the medical domain. We categorize the landscape of modern efficient models into three primary streams: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Lightweight Transformers, and emerging Linear Complexity Models. Furthermore, we examine key model compression strategies (including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization) and evaluate their efficacy in maintaining diagnostic performance while reducing hardware requirements. By identifying current limitations and discussing the transition toward on-device intelligence, this review serves as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to bridge the gap between high-performance AI and resource-constrained clinical environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00918v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS) addresses decision-making problems in which predictions must be made as early as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Most existing ECTS methods assume that the time-dependent decision costs governing the learning objective are known, fixed, and correctly specified. In practice, however, these costs are often uncertain and may change over time, leading to mismatches between training-time and deployment-time objectives. In this paper, we study ECTS under two practically relevant forms of cost non-stationarity: drift in the balance between misclassification and decision delay costs, and stochastic realizations of decision costs that deviate from the nominal training-time model. To address these challenges, we revisit representative ECTS approaches and adapt them to an online learning setting. Focusing on separable methods, we update only the triggering model during deployment, while keeping the classifier fixed. We propose several online adaptations and baselines, including bandit-based and RL-based approaches, and conduct controlled experiments on synthetic data to systematically evaluate robustness under cost non-stationarity. Our results demonstrate that online learning can effectively improve the robustness of ECTS methods to cost drift, with RL-based strategies exhibiting strong and stable performance across varying cost regimes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00927v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training LLMs to think and reason for longer has become a key ingredient in building state-of-the-art models that can solve complex problems previously out of reach. Recent efforts pursue this in different ways, such as RL fine-tuning to elicit long CoT or scaling latent reasoning through architectural recurrence. This makes reasoning length an important scaling knob. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon (both theoretically and experimentally): under outcome-only supervision, out-of-distribution (OOD) performance can continue improving as training-time reasoning length (e.g., the token budget in RL, or the loop count in looped Transformers) increases, even after in-distribution (ID) performance has saturated. This suggests that robustness may require a larger budget than ID validation alone would indicate. We provide theoretical explanations via two mechanisms: (i) self-iteration can induce a stronger inductive bias in the hypothesis class, reshaping ID-optimal solutions in ways that improve OOD generalization; and (ii) when shortcut solutions that work for ID samples but not for OOD samples persist in the hypothesis class, regularization can reduce the learned solution's reliance on these shortcuts as the number of self-iterations increases. We complement the theory with empirical evidence from two realizations of scaling training-time reasoning length: increasing the number of loops in looped Transformers on a synthetic task, and increasing token budgets during RL fine-tuning of LLMs on mathematical reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00931v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model reasoning is often treated as a monolithic capability, relying on binary preference supervision that fails to capture partial progress or fine-grained reasoning quality. We introduce Continuous Utility Direct Preference Optimization (CU-DPO), a framework that aligns models to a portfolio of prompt-based cognitive strategies by replacing binary labels with continuous scores that capture fine-grained reasoning quality. We prove that learning with K strategies yields a Theta(K log K) improvement in sample complexity over binary preferences, and that DPO converges to the entropy-regularized utility-maximizing policy. To exploit this signal, we propose a two-stage training pipeline: (i) strategy selection, which optimizes the model to choose the best strategy for a given problem via best-vs-all comparisons, and (ii) execution refinement, which trains the model to correctly execute the selected strategy using margin-stratified pairs. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, CU-DPO improves strategy selection accuracy from 35-46 percent to 68-78 percent across seven base models, yielding consistent downstream reasoning gains of up to 6.6 points on in-distribution datasets with effective transfer to out-of-distribution tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00942v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern large language models are increasingly deployed under compute and memory constraints, making flexible control of model capacity a central challenge. While sparse and low-rank structures naturally trade off capacity and performance, existing approaches often rely on heuristic designs that ignore layer and matrix heterogeneity or require model-specific architectural modifications. We propose SALAAD, a plug-and-play framework applicable to different model architectures that induces sparse and low-rank structures during training. By formulating structured weight learning under an augmented Lagrangian framework and introducing an adaptive controller that dynamically balances the training loss and structural constraints, SALAAD preserves the stability of standard training dynamics while enabling explicit control over the evolution of effective model capacity during training. Experiments across model scales show that SALAAD substantially reduces memory consumption during deployment while achieving performance comparable to ad-hoc methods. Moreover, a single training run yields a continuous spectrum of model capacities, enabling smooth and elastic deployment across diverse memory budgets without the need for retraining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cold-start exploration is a core challenge in large-scale recommender systems: new or data-sparse items must receive traffic to estimate value, but over-exploration harms users and wastes impressions. In practice, Thompson Sampling (TS) is often initialized with a uniform Beta(1,1) prior, implicitly assuming a 50% success rate for unseen items. When true base rates are far lower, this optimistic prior systematically over-allocates to weak items. The impact is amplified by batched policy updates and pipeline latency: for hours, newly launched items can remain effectively "no data," so the prior dominates allocation before feedback is incorporated. We propose Dynamic Prior Thompson Sampling, a prior design that directly controls the probability that a new arm outcompetes the incumbent winner. Our key contribution is a closed-form quadratic solution for the prior mean that enforces P(X_j > Y_k) = epsilon at introduction time, making exploration intensity predictable and tunable while preserving TS Bayesian updates. Across Monte Carlo validation, offline batched simulations, and a large-scale online experiment on a thumbnail personalization system serving millions of users, dynamic priors deliver precise exploration control and improved efficiency versus a uniform-prior baseline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00952v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The trade-off between labeled data availability and downstream accuracy remains a central challenge in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We propose a principled framework for \emph{budget-aware supervised fine-tuning} by casting LLM adaptation as a contextual Stackelberg game. In our formulation, the learner (leader) commits to a scoring policy and a label-querying strategy, while an adaptive environment (follower) selects challenging supervised alternatives in response. To explicitly address label efficiency, we incorporate a finite supervision budget directly into the learning objective. Our algorithm operates in the full-feedback regime and achieves $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret under standard linear contextual assumptions. We extend the framework with a Largest-Latency-First (LLF) confidence gate that selectively queries labels, achieving a budget-aware regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dB} + c\sqrt{B})$ with $B=\beta T$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00953v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant progress in computational pathology, many AI models remain black-box and difficult to interpret, posing a major barrier to clinical adoption due to limited transparency and explainability. This has motivated continued interest in engineered image-based biomarkers, which offer greater interpretability but are often proposed based on anecdotal evidence or fragmented prior literature rather than systematic biological validation. We introduce SAGE (Structured Agentic system for hypothesis Generation and Evaluation), an agentic AI system designed to identify interpretable, engineered pathology biomarkers by grounding them in biological evidence. SAGE integrates literature-anchored reasoning with multimodal data analysis to correlate image-derived features with molecular biomarkers, such as gene expression, and clinically relevant outcomes. By coordinating specialized agents for biological contextualization and empirical hypothesis validation, SAGE prioritizes transparent, biologically supported biomarkers and advances the clinical translation of computational pathology.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model adaptation to production environment is critical for reliable Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), less attention is paid to developing systematic framework for updating the ML models when they fail under data drift. This paper compares the transfer learning enabled model update strategies including ensemble transfer learning (ETL), all-layers transfer learning (ALTL), and last-layer transfer learning (LLTL) for updating the failed feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The flue gas differential pressure across the air preheater unit installed in a 660 MW thermal power plant is analyzed as a case study since it mimics the batch processes due to load cycling in the power plant. Updating the failed ANN model by three transfer learning techniques reveals that ETL provides relatively higher predictive accuracy for the batch size of 5 days than those of LLTL and ALTL. However, ALTL is found to be suitable for effective update of the model trained on large batch size (8 days). A mixed trend is observed for computational requirement (hyperparameter tuning and model training) of model update techniques for different batch sizes. These fundamental and empiric insights obtained from the batch process-based industrial case study can assist the MLOps practitioners in adapting the failed models to data drifts for the accurate monitoring of industrial processes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00959v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be seen as compressed knowledge bases, but it remains unclear what knowledge they truly contain and how far their knowledge boundaries extend. Existing benchmarks are mostly static and provide limited support for systematic knowledge probing. In this paper, we propose an interactive agentic framework to systematically extract and quantify the knowledge of LLMs. Our method includes four adaptive exploration policies to probe knowledge at different granularities. To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction. Finally, our results show that differences in training data composition lead to distinct and measurable knowledge profiles across model families.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00960v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) increasingly requires models that capture multimodal conditional uncertainty arising from ill-posed inverse problems, multistability, and chaotic dynamics. While recent work has favored highly expressive implicit generative models such as diffusion and flow-based methods, these approaches are often data-hungry, computationally costly, and misaligned with the structured solution spaces frequently found in scientific problems. We demonstrate that Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) provide a principled yet largely overlooked alternative for multimodal uncertainty quantification in SciML. As explicit parametric density estimators, MDNs impose an inductive bias tailored to low-dimensional, multimodal physics, enabling direct global allocation of probability mass across distinct solution branches. This structure delivers strong data efficiency, allowing reliable recovery of separated modes in regimes where scientific data is scarce. We formalize these insights through a unified probabilistic framework contrasting explicit and implicit distribution networks, and demonstrate empirically that MDNs achieve superior generalization, interpretability, and sample efficiency across a range of inverse, multistable, and chaotic scientific regression tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) at ultra-low precision is critically impeded by instability rooted in the conflict between discrete quantization constraints and the intrinsic heavy-tailed spectral nature of linguistic data. By formalizing the connection between Zipfian statistics and random matrix theory, we prove that the power-law decay in the singular value spectra of embeddings is a fundamental requisite for semantic encoding. We derive theoretical bounds showing that uniform quantization introduces a noise floor that disproportionately truncates this spectral tail, which induces spectral flattening and a strictly provable increase in the stable rank of representations. Empirical validation across diverse architectures including GPT-2 and TinyLlama corroborates that this geometric degradation precipitates representational collapse. This work not only quantifies the spectral sensitivity of LLMs but also establishes spectral fidelity as a necessary condition for stable low-bit optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00974v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Label-supervised manifold alignment bridges the gap between unsupervised and correspondence-based paradigms by leveraging shared label information to align multimodal datasets. Still, most existing methods rely on Euclidean geometry to model intra-domain relationships. This approach can fail when features are only weakly related to the task of interest, leading to noisy, semantically misleading structure and degraded alignment quality. To address this limitation, we introduce FoSTA (Forest-guided Semantic Transport Alignment), a scalable alignment framework that leverages forest-induced geometry to denoise intra-domain structure and recover task-relevant manifolds prior to alignment. FoSTA builds semantic representations directly from label-informed forest affinities and aligns them via fast, hierarchical semantic transport, capturing meaningful cross-domain relationships. Extensive comparisons with established baselines demonstrate that FoSTA improves correspondence recovery and label transfer on synthetic benchmarks and delivers strong performance in practical single-cell applications, including batch correction and biological conservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00987v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling non-stationary processes, where statistical properties vary across the input domain, is a critical challenge in machine learning; yet most scalable methods rely on a simplifying assumption of stationarity. This forces a difficult trade-off: use expressive but computationally demanding models like Deep Gaussian Processes, or scalable but limited methods like Random Fourier Features (RFF). We close this gap by introducing Random Wavelet Features (RWF), a framework that constructs scalable, non-stationary kernel approximations by sampling from wavelet families. By harnessing the inherent localization and multi-resolution structure of wavelets, RWF generates an explicit feature map that captures complex, input-dependent patterns. Our framework provides a principled way to generalize RFF to the non-stationary setting and comes with a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including positive definiteness, unbiasedness, and uniform convergence guarantees. We demonstrate empirically on a range of challenging synthetic and real-world datasets that RWF outperforms stationary random features and offers a compelling accuracy-efficiency trade-off against more complex models, unlocking scalable and expressive kernel methods for a broad class of real-world non-stationary problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key training step for improving mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but it often has high GPU memory usage, which makes it hard to use in settings with limited resources. To reduce these issues, we propose Evolution Strategies with Sharpness-Aware Maximization (ESSAM), a full parameter fine-tuning framework that tightly combines the zero-order search in parameter space from Evolution Strategies (ES) with the Sharpness-Aware Maximization (SAM) to improve generalization. We conduct fine-tuning experiments on the mainstream mathematica reasoning task GSM8K. The results show that ESSAM achieves an average accuracy of 78.27\% across all models and its overall performance is comparable to RL methods. It surpasses classic RL algorithm PPO with an accuracy of 77.72\% and is comparable to GRPO with an accuracy of 78.34\%, and even surpassing them on some models. In terms of GPU memory usage, ESSAM reduces the average GPU memory usage by $18\times$ compared to PPO and by $10\times$ compared to GRPO, achieving an extremely low GPU memory usage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01005v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Childhood anemia remains a major public health challenge in Nepal and is associated with impaired growth, cognition, and increased morbidity. Using World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds, we defined anemia status for children aged 6-59 months and formulated a binary classification task by grouping all anemia severities as \emph{anemic} versus \emph{not anemic}. We analyzed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2022) microdata comprising 1,855 children and initially considered 48 candidate features spanning demographic, socioeconomic, maternal, and child health characteristics. To obtain a stable and substantiated feature set, we applied four features selection techniques (Chi-square, mutual information, point-biserial correlation, and Boruta) and prioritized features supported by multi-method consensus. Five features: child age, recent fever, household size, maternal anemia, and parasite deworming were consistently selected by all methods, while amenorrhea, ethnicity indicators, and provinces were frequently retained. We then compared eight traditional machine learning classifiers (LR, KNN, DT, RF, XGBoost, SVM, NB, LDA) with two deep learning models (DNN and TabNet) using standard evaluation metrics, emphasizing F1-score and recall due to class imbalance. Among all models, logistic regression attained the best recall (0.701) and the highest F1-score (0.649), while DNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.709), and SVM yielded the strongest discrimination with the highest AUC (0.736). Overall, the results indicate that both machine learning and deep learning models can provide competitive anemia prediction and the interpretable features such as child age, infection proxy, maternal anemia, and deworming history are central for risk stratification and public health screening in Nepal.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models have transformed language, vision, and time series data analysis, yet progress on dynamic predictions for physical systems remains limited. Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\underline{LA}rge-\underline{S}cale \underline{S}mall \underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) is often unfaithful: intermediate steps can be logically inconsistent or fail to reflect the causal relationship leading to the final answer. Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy. Mechanistic analysis reveals that models learn to encode internal uncertainty by resolving inconsistent reasoning steps, which suggests the emergence of implicit self-verification from autoregressive training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01025v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with vision encoders, enabling text generation conditioned on both images and text. However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/kaiyuanCui/UltraBreak}{GitHub repository}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization is a promising approach for compressing large language models under tight memory budgets. However, existing mixed-precision methods typically suffer from one of two limitations: they either rely on expensive discrete optimization to determine precision allocation, or introduce hardware inefficiencies due to irregular memory layouts. We propose SFMP, a search-free and hardware-friendly mixed-precision quantization framework for large language models. The framework is built upon four novel ideas: Fractional bit-width, which extends integer bit-width for weight matrix to fractional value and transforms discrete precision allocation as a continuous problem; 2)Block-wise mixed-precision, enabling fine-grained precision within weight matrices while remaining hardware-friendly; 3)Row-column weight reordering, which aggregates salient weights via row and column reordering, incurring only a small activation reordering overhead during inference; 4)Unified GEMM kernel, which supports mixed-precision GEMM at arbitrary average bit-width. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFMP outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise mixed-precision methods under the same memory constraints, while significantly reducing quantization cost and improving inference efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across large-scale distributed service nodes while preserving data privacy, making it a cornerstone of intelligent service systems in edge-cloud environments. However, in real-world service-oriented deployments, data generated by heterogeneous users, devices, and application scenarios are inherently non-IID. This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic. These properties make FLood a practical and scalable solution for deploying reliable intelligent services in real-world federated environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01045v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate the role of feature superposition in the emergence of power-law training dynamics using a teacher-student framework. We first derive an analytic theory for training without superposition, establishing that the power-law training exponent depends on both the input data statistics and channel importance. Remarkably, we discover that a superposition bottleneck induces a transition to a universal power-law exponent of $\sim 1$, independent of data and channel statistics. This one over time training with superposition represents an up to tenfold acceleration compared to the purely sequential learning that takes place in the absence of superposition. Our finding that superposition leads to rapid training with a data-independent power law exponent may have important implications for a wide range of neural networks that employ superposition, including production-scale large language models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Repertoire-level analysis of T cell receptors offers a biologically grounded signal for disease detection and immune monitoring, yet practical deployment is impeded by label sparsity, cohort heterogeneity, and the computational burden of adapting large encoders to new tasks. We introduce a framework that synthesizes compact task-specific parameterizations from a learned dictionary of prototypes conditioned on lightweight task descriptors derived from repertoire probes and pooled embedding statistics. This synthesis produces small adapter modules applied to a frozen pretrained backbone, enabling immediate adaptation to novel tasks with only a handful of support examples and without full model fine-tuning. The architecture preserves interpretability through motif-aware probes and a calibrated motif discovery pipeline that links predictive decisions to sequence-level signals. Together, these components yield a practical, sample-efficient, and interpretable pathway for translating repertoire-informed models into diverse clinical and research settings where labeled data are scarce and computational resources are constrained.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01053v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Role specialization in multi-LLM agent systems is often realized via multi-LoRA, where agents share a pretrained backbone and differ only through lightweight adapters. Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01058v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training of reasoning LLMs is a holistic process that typically consists of an offline SFT stage followed by an online reinforcement learning (RL) stage. However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone.   We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.   We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.   We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025. Our results suggest that PEAR is an effective step toward more holistic LLM post-training by designing and evaluating SFT with downstream RL in mind rather than in isolation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01083v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weight-space learning studies neural architectures that operate directly on the parameters of other neural networks. Motivated by the growing availability of pretrained models, recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of weight-space networks across a wide range of tasks. SOTA weight-space networks rely on permutation-equivariant designs to improve generalization. However, this may negatively affect expressive power, warranting theoretical investigation. Importantly, unlike other structured domains, weight-space learning targets maps operating on both weight and function spaces, making expressivity analysis particularly subtle. While a few prior works provide partial expressivity results, a comprehensive characterization is still missing. In this work, we address this gap by developing a systematic theory for expressivity of weight-space networks. We first prove that all prominent permutation-equivariant networks are equivalent in expressive power. We then establish universality in both weight- and function-space settings under mild, natural assumptions on the input weights, and characterize the edge-case regimes where universality no longer holds. Together, these results provide a strong and unified foundation for the expressivity of weight-space networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many optimizers can be interpreted as steepest-descent methods under norm-induced geometries, and thus inherit corresponding implicit biases. We introduce \nameA{} (\fullname{}), which combines spectral control from orthogonalized update directions with $\ell_\infty$-style coordinate control from sign updates. \nameA{} forms a Lion-style momentum direction, approximately orthogonalizes it via a few Newton--Schulz iterations, and then applies an entrywise sign, providing an efficient approximation to taking a maximal step over the intersection of the spectral and $\ell_\infty$ constraint sets (a scaled Hadamard-like set for matrix parameters). Despite the strong nonlinearity of orthogonalization and sign, we prove convergence under a mild, empirically verified diagonal-isotropy assumption. Across large-scale language and vision training, including GPT-2 and Llama pretraining, SiT image pretraining, and supervised fine-tuning, \nameA{} matches or outperforms AdamW and Muon under comparable tuning while using only momentum-level optimizer state, and it mitigates optimizer mismatch when fine-tuning AdamW-pretrained checkpoints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly adopted in industrial graph-based monitoring systems (e.g., Industrial internet of things (IIoT) device graphs, power-grid topology models, and manufacturing communication networks) to support anomaly detection, state estimation, and asset classification. In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sequential scaling is a prominent inference-time scaling paradigm, yet its performance improvements are typically modest and not well understood, largely due to the prevalence of heuristic, non-principled approaches that obscure clear optimality bounds. To address this, we propose a principled framework that models sequential scaling as a two-state Markov process. This approach reveals the underlying properties of sequential scaling and yields closed-form solutions for essential aspects, such as the specific conditions under which accuracy is improved and the theoretical upper, neutral, and lower performance bounds. Leveraging this formulation, we develop MarkovScale, a practical system that applies these optimality criteria to achieve a theoretically grounded balance between accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across 3 backbone LLMs, 5 benchmarks, and over 20 configurations show that MarkovScale consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parallel and sequential scaling methods, representing a significant step toward optimal and resource-efficient inference in LLMs. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning requires capturing both structural relationships and temporal evolution, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: attention-based methods achieve expressiveness at $O(T^2)$ complexity, while recurrent architectures suffer from gradient pathologies and dense state storage. Spiking neural networks offer event-driven efficiency but remain limited by sequential propagation, binary information loss, and local aggregation that misses global context. We propose ChronoSpike, an adaptive spiking graph neural network that integrates learnable LIF neurons with per-channel membrane dynamics, multi-head attentive spatial aggregation on continuous features, and a lightweight Transformer temporal encoder, enabling both fine-grained local modeling and long-range dependency capture with linear memory complexity $O(T \cdot d)$. On three large-scale benchmarks, ChronoSpike outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baselines by $2.0\%$ Macro-F1 and $2.4\%$ Micro-F1 while achieving $3-10\times$ faster training than recurrent methods with a constant 105K-parameter budget independent of graph size. We provide theoretical guarantees for membrane potential boundedness, gradient flow stability under contraction factor $\rho < 1$, and BIBO stability; interpretability analyses reveal heterogeneous temporal receptive fields and a learned primacy effect with $83-88\%$ sparsity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly underpin intelligent web applications, from chatbots to search and recommendation, where efficient specialization is essential. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables such adaptation with minimal overhead, while federated LoRA allows web service providers to fine-tune shared models without data sharing. However, in privacy-sensitive deployments, clients inject varying levels of differential privacy (DP) noise, creating privacy heterogeneity that misaligns individual incentives and global performance. In this paper, we propose WinFLoRA, a privacy-heterogeneous federated LoRA that utilizes aggregation weights as incentives with noise awareness. Specifically, the noises from clients are estimated based on the uploaded LoRA adapters. A larger weight indicates greater influence on the global model and better downstream task performance, rewarding lower-noise contributions. By up-weighting low-noise updates, WinFLoRA improves global accuracy while accommodating clients' heterogeneous privacy requirements. Consequently, WinFLoRA aligns heterogeneous client utility in terms of privacy and downstream performance with global model objectives without third-party involvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that across multiple LLMs and datasets, WinFLoRA achieves up to 52.58% higher global accuracy and up to 2.56x client utility than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Our goal is to enable large language models (LLMs) to balance multiple human preference dimensions; such as helpfulness, safety, and verbosity, through principled and controllable alignment. Existing preference optimization methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), collapse feedback into a single scalar reward, fixing one balance among objectives and preventing traversal of the Pareto front. Recent work by Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2023) showed that fine-tuning can be viewed in a model's tangent space, where linearized updates act as additive vectors that can be composed to jointly perform well on multiple tasks. Building on this formulation, we extend this idea to preference alignment and propose Tangent-Space Direct Preference Optimization (TS-DPO), which performs DPO within this locally linear regime to learn per-objective update directions. These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) further shows that tangent-space training amplifies canonical directions aligned with distinct preferences, improving disentanglement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study causal discovery from a single observed sequence of discrete events generated by a stochastic process, as encountered in vehicle logs, manufacturing systems, or patient trajectories. This regime is particularly challenging due to the absence of repeated samples, high dimensionality, and long-range temporal dependencies of the single observation during inference. We introduce TRACE, a scalable framework that repurposes autoregressive models as pretrained density estimators for conditional mutual information estimation. TRACE infers the summary causal graph between event types in a sequence, scaling linearly with the event vocabulary and supporting delayed causal effects, while being fully parallel on GPUs. We establish its theoretical identifiability under imperfect autoregressive models. Experiments demonstrate robust performance across different baselines and varying vocabulary sizes including an application to root-cause analysis in vehicle diagnostics with over 29,100 event types.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01136v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We develop a unified matrix-spectral framework for analyzing stability and interpretability in deep neural networks. Representing networks as data-dependent products of linear operators reveals spectral quantities governing sensitivity to input perturbations, label noise, and training dynamics.   We introduce a Global Matrix Stability Index that aggregates spectral information from Jacobians, parameter gradients, Neural Tangent Kernel operators, and loss Hessians into a single stability scale controlling forward sensitivity, attribution robustness, and optimization conditioning. We further show that spectral entropy refines classical operator-norm bounds by capturing typical, rather than purely worst-case, sensitivity.   These quantities yield computable diagnostics and stability-oriented regularization principles. Synthetic experiments and controlled studies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 confirm that modest spectral regularization substantially improves attribution stability even when global spectral summaries change little.   The results establish a precise connection between spectral concentration and analytic stability, providing practical guidance for robustness-aware model design and training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01137v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for alignment typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, both limited by the cost and scarcity of high-quality annotations. Recent self-play and synthetic data approaches reduce this dependence but often rely on heuristic assumptions or ungrounded self-evaluation, which can cause bias accumulation and performance drift. In this paper, we propose Self-Generative Adversarial LLM (SGALM), a unified fine-tuning framework that formulates alignment as a generative adversarial game within a single LLM. SGALM jointly evolves generation and discrimination capabilities without external reward models. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that SGALM achieves state-of-the-art performance, serves as an effective alignment algorithm and a robust synthetic data engine.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from structured data. Despite their growing popularity and success across various applications, GNNs encounter several challenges that limit their performance. in their generalization, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and the effectiveness of their representation learning capabilities. In this dissertation, I investigate these core aspects through three main contributions: (1) developing new representation learning techniques based on Graph Shift Operators (GSOs, aiming for enhanced performance across various contexts and applications, (2) introducing generalization-enhancing methods through graph data augmentation, and (3) developing more robust GNNs by leveraging orthonormalization techniques and noise-based defenses against adversarial attacks. By addressing these challenges, my work provides a more principled understanding of the limitations and potential of GNNs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) underpins modern generative and representation models by turning continuous latents into discrete tokens. Yet hard nearest-neighbor assignments are non-differentiable and are typically optimized with heuristic straight-through estimators, which couple the update step size to the quantization gap and train each code in isolation, leading to unstable gradients and severe codebook under-utilization at scale. In this paper, we introduce GRIT-VQ (Generalized Radius and Integrated Transform-Vector Quantization), a unified surrogate framework that keeps hard assignments in the forward pass while making VQ fully differentiable. GRIT-VQ replaces the straight-through estimator with a radius-based update that moves latents along the quantization direction with a controllable, geometry-aware step, and applies a data-agnostic integrated transform to the codebook so that all codes are updated through shared parameters instead of independently. Our theoretical analysis clarifies the fundamental optimization dynamics introduced by GRIT-VQ, establishing conditions for stable gradient flow, coordinated codebook evolution, and reliable avoidance of collapse across a broad family of quantizers. Across image reconstruction, image generation, and recommendation tokenization benchmarks, GRIT-VQ consistently improves reconstruction error, generative quality, and recommendation accuracy while substantially increasing codebook utilization compared to existing VQ variants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01150v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is essential for enforcing the right to be forgotten in machine learning systems. A key challenge of MU is how to reliably audit whether a model has truly forgotten specified training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used for unlearning auditing, where samples that evade membership detection are often regarded as successfully forgotten. After carefully revisiting the reliability of MIA, we show that this assumption is flawed: failed membership inference does not imply true forgetting. We theoretically demonstrate that MIA-based auditing, when formulated as a binary classification problem, inevitably incurs statistical errors whose magnitude cannot be observed during the auditing process. This leads to overly optimistic evaluations of unlearning performance, while incurring substantial computational overhead due to shadow model training. To address these limitations, we propose Statistical Membership Inference Attack (SMIA), a novel training-free and highly effective auditing framework. SMIA directly compares the distributions of member and non-member data using statistical tests, eliminating the need for learned attack models. Moreover, SMIA outputs both a forgetting rate and a corresponding confidence interval, enabling quantified reliability of the auditing results. Extensive experiments show that SMIA provides more reliable auditing with significantly lower computational cost than existing MIA-based approaches. Notably, the theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness of SMIA suggest it as a new paradigm for reliable machine unlearning auditing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01156v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Among on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) demonstrates is widely favored for its simplicity, numerical stability, and strong empirical performance. Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO. Notably, results on MultiGoal highlight PolicyFlow's ability to capture richer multimodal action distributions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for operational planning, trading, and flexible asset scheduling in liberalised power systems, yet remains challenging due to volatility, heavy-tailed spikes, and frequent regime shifts. While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into neural network training. However, solving high-fidelity PDEs remains computationally prohibitive, particularly for parametric systems requiring multiple evaluations across varying parameter configurations. This paper presents MF-BPINN, a novel multi-fidelity framework that synergistically combines physics-informed neural networks with Bayesian uncertainty quantification and adaptive residual learning. Our approach leverages abundant low-fidelity simulations alongside sparse high-fidelity data through a hierarchical neural architecture that learns nonlinear correlations across fidelity levels. We introduce an adaptive residual network with learnable gating mechanisms that dynamically balances linear and nonlinear fidelity discrepancies. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous Bayesian framework employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01179v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) aims to mitigate domain shift by progressively adapting models from the source domain to the target domain via intermediate domains. However, real intermediate domains are often unavailable or ineffective, necessitating the synthesis of intermediate samples. Flow-based models have recently been used for this purpose by interpolating between source and target distributions; however, their training typically relies on sample-based log-likelihood estimation, which can discard useful information and thus degrade GDA performance. The key to addressing this limitation is constructing the intermediate domains via samples directly. To this end, we propose an Entropy-regularized Semi-dual Unbalanced Optimal Transport (E-SUOT) framework to construct intermediate domains. Specifically, we reformulate flow-based GDA as a Lagrangian dual problem and derive an equivalent semi-dual objective that circumvents the need for likelihood estimation. However, the dual problem leads to an unstable min-max training procedure. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce entropy regularization to convert it into a more stable alternative optimization procedure. Based on this, we propose a novel GDA training framework and provide theoretical analysis in terms of stability and generalization. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the E-SUOT framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise for Time-Series Data Imputation (TSDI); however, their performance remains inconsistent in complex scenarios. We attribute this to two primary obstacles: (1) non-stationary temporal dynamics, which can bias the inference trajectory and lead to outlier-sensitive imputations; and (2) objective inconsistency, since imputation favors accurate pointwise recovery whereas DMs are inherently trained to generate diverse samples. To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity. Subsequently, we remove the dissipative structure and derive the complete SPIRIT workflow, with SPT serving as the proximal operator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SPIRIT approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01186v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Classical Federated Learning relies on a multi-round iterative process of model exchange and aggregation between server and clients, with high communication costs and privacy risks from repeated model transmissions. In contrast, one-shot federated learning (OFL) alleviates these limitations by reducing communication to a single round, thereby lowering overhead and enhancing practical deployability. Nevertheless, most existing one-shot approaches remain either impractical or constrained, for example, they often depend on the availability of a public dataset, assume homogeneous client models, or require uploading additional data or model information. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Gaussian-Head OFL (GH-OFL) family, a suite of one-shot federated methods that assume class-conditional Gaussianity of pretrained embeddings. Clients transmit only sufficient statistics (per-class counts and first/second-order moments) and the server builds heads via three components: (i) Closed-form Gaussian heads (NB/LDA/QDA) computed directly from the received statistics; (ii) FisherMix, a linear head with cosine margin trained on synthetic samples drawn in an estimated Fisher subspace; and (iii) Proto-Hyper, a lightweight low-rank residual head that refines Gaussian logits via knowledge distillation on those synthetic samples. In our experiments, GH-OFL methods deliver state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy under strong non-IID skew while remaining strictly data-free.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recurrent neural policies are widely used in partially observable control and meta-RL tasks. Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts. However, until today, the underlying mechanisms for their superior generalization and robustness performance remain poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we revisit Transformer optimization through the lens of second-order geometry and establish a direct connection between architectural design, activation scale, the Hessian matrix, and the maximum tolerable learning rate. We introduce a simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales by construction. Then, by analyzing the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations, we theoretically show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting larger stable learning rates. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on large GPT models at parameter scales 1B, 1.4B, 7B and 8B. Empirically, SimpleGPT, our SimpleNorm-based network, tolerates learning rates 3$\times$-10$\times$ larger than standard convention, consistently demonstrates strong optimization stability, and achieves substantially better performance than well-established baselines. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, SimpleGPT achieves a training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/SimpleGPT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: User-driven privacy allows individuals to control whether and at what granularity their data is shared, leading to datasets that mix original, generalized, and missing values within the same records and attributes. While such representations are intuitive for privacy, they pose challenges for machine learning, which typically treats non-original values as new categories or as missing, thereby discarding generalization semantics. For learning from such tabular data, we propose novel data transformation strategies that account for heterogeneous anonymization and evaluate them alongside standard imputation and LLM-based approaches. We employ multiple datasets, privacy configurations, and deployment scenarios, demonstrating that our method reliably regains utility. Our results show that generalized values are preferable to pure suppression, that the best data preparation strategy depends on the scenario, and that consistent data representations are crucial for maintaining downstream utility. Overall, our findings highlight that effective learning is tied to the appropriate handling of anonymized values.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The attention operator in Transformers can be viewed as a two-layer fast-weight MLP, whose weights are dynamically instantiated from input tokens and whose width equals sequence length $N$. As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query. We call this strategy a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations (MiTA), and refer to the resulting efficient mechanism as MiTA attention. Preliminary experiments on vision tasks demonstrate the promise of our MiTA attention and motivate further investigation on its optimization and broader applications in more challenging settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01233v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training efficiency in large-scale models is typically assessed through memory consumption, training time, and model performance. Current methods often exhibit trade-offs among these metrics, as optimizing one generally degrades at least one of the others. Addressing this trade-off remains a central challenge in algorithm design. While GaLore enables memory-efficient training by updating gradients in a low-rank subspace, it incurs a comparable extra training time cost due to the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) process on gradients. In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces. Experimental results indicate that Lotus is the most efficient method, achieving a 30% reduction in training time and a 40% decrease in memory consumption for gradient and optimizer states. Additionally, it outperforms the baseline method in both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01247v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Brain-to-speech decoding models demonstrate robust performance in vocalized, mimed, and imagined speech; yet, the fundamental mechanisms via which these models capture and transmit information across different speech modalities are less explored. In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability to causally investigate the internal representations of a neural speech decoder. We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity. Together, our findings give a causal explanation for how speech modality information is organized and used in brain-to-speech decoding models, revealing hierarchical and direction-dependent representational structure across speech modes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from static data but often suffers from poor coverage of the state-action space and distributional shift problems. This problem can be addressed by allowing limited online interactions to selectively refine uncertain regions of the learned value function, which is referred to as Active Reinforcement Learning (ActiveRL). While there has been good empirical success, no theoretical analysis is available in the literature. We fill this gap by developing a rigorous sample-complexity analysis of ActiveRL through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling. In this respect, we propose an algorithm and using GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, we derive high-probability guarantees showing that an $\epsilon$-optimal policy can be learned with ${\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$ active transitions, improving upon the $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^4)$ rate of purely offline methods. Our results reveal that ActiveRL achieves near-optimal information efficiency, that is, guided uncertainty reduction leads to accelerated value-function convergence with minimal online data. Our analysis builds on GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, bridging Bayesian nonparametric regression and reinforcement learning theories. We conduct several experiments to validate the algorithm and theoretical findings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01265v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a machine learning framework that transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. The vanilla KD proposed by Hinton et al. has been the dominant approach in logit-based distillation and demonstrates compelling performance. However, it only performs sample-wise probability alignment between teacher and student's predictions, lacking an mechanism for class-wise comparison. Besides, vanilla KD imposes no structural constraint on the probability space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective methodology, bilateral contrastive knowledge distillation (BicKD). This approach introduces a novel bilateral contrastive loss, which intensifies the orthogonality among different class generalization spaces while preserving consistency within the same class. The bilateral formulation enables explicit comparison of both sample-wise and class-wise prediction patterns between teacher and student. By emphasizing probabilistic orthogonality, BicKD further regularizes the geometric structure of the predictive distribution. Extensive experiments show that our BicKD method enhances knowledge transfer, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques across various model architectures and benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kronecker adapters have emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning large-scale models, enabling high-rank updates through tunable component structures. However, existing work largely treats the component structure as a fixed or heuristic design choice, leaving the dimensions and number of Kronecker components underexplored. In this paper, we identify component structure as a key factor governing the capacity of Kronecker adapters. We perform a fine-grained analysis of both the dimensions and number of Kronecker components. In particular, we show that the alignment between Kronecker adapters and full fine-tuning depends on component configurations. Guided by these insights, we propose Component Designed Kronecker Adapters (CDKA). We further provide parameter-budget-aware configuration guidelines and a tailored training stabilization strategy for practical deployment. Experiments across various natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of CDKA. Code is available at https://github.com/rainstonee/CDKA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01270v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A fundamental challenge in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) is achieving sample efficiency in visual domains where tasks exhibit substantial heterogeneity in both observations and dynamics. Model-based reinforcement learning offers a promising path to improved sample efficiency through world models, but standard monolithic architectures struggle to capture diverse task dynamics, resulting in poor reconstruction and prediction accuracy. We introduce Mixture-of-World Models (MoW), a scalable architecture that combines modular variational autoencoders for task-adaptive visual compression, a hybrid Transformer-based dynamics model with task-conditioned experts and a shared backbone, and a gradient-based task clustering strategy for efficient parameter allocation. On the Atari 100k benchmark, a single MoW agent trained once on 26 Atari games achieves a mean human-normalized score of 110.4%, competitive with the score of 114.2% achieved by STORM, an ensemble of 26 task-specific models, while using 50% fewer parameters. On Meta-World, MoW achieves a 74.5% average success rate within 300 thousand environment steps, establishing a new state of the art. These results demonstrate that MoW provides a scalable and parameter-efficient foundation for generalist world models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Telecommunication networks are increasingly expected to operate autonomously while supporting heterogeneous services with diverse and often conflicting intents -- that is, performance objectives, constraints, and requirements specific to each service. However, transforming high-level intents -- such as ultra-low latency, high throughput, or energy efficiency -- into concrete control actions (i.e., low-level actuator commands) remains beyond the capability of existing heuristic approaches. This work introduces an Agentic AI system for intent-driven autonomous networks, structured around three specialized agents. A supervisory interpreter agent, powered by language models, performs both lexical parsing of intents into executable optimization templates and cognitive refinement based on feedback, constraint feasibility, and evolving network conditions. An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian Last Layers (BLLs) provide a convenient and computationally efficient way to estimate uncertainty in neural networks. However, they underestimate epistemic uncertainty because they apply a Bayesian treatment only to the final layer, ignoring uncertainty induced by earlier layers. We propose a method that improves BLLs by leveraging a projection of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) features onto the space spanned by the last-layer features. This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty. To further reduce computational cost, we introduce a uniform subsampling scheme for estimating the projection matrix and for posterior inference. We derive approximation bounds for both types of sub-sampling. Empirical evaluations on UCI regression, contextual bandits, image classification, and out-of-distribution detection tasks in image and tabular datasets, demonstrate improved calibration and uncertainty estimates compared to standard BLLs and competitive baselines, while reducing computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring factuality is essential for the safe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as medicine and law. Conformal inference provides distribution-free guarantees, but existing approaches are either overly conservative, discarding many true-claims, or rely on adaptive error rates and simple linear models that fail to capture complex group structures. To address these challenges, we reformulate conformal inference in a multiplicative filtering setting, modeling factuality as a product of claim-level scores. Our method, Multi-LLM Adaptive Conformal Inference (MACI), leverages ensembles to produce more accurate factuality-scores, which in our experiments led to higher retention, while validity is preserved through group-conditional calibration. Experiments show that MACI consistently achieves user-specified coverage with substantially higher retention and lower time cost than baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01288v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Entropy-based confidence signals are increasingly leveraged to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches treat confidence as a static quantity -- typically aggregated over tokens. We show that the \emph{temporal evolution} of confidence during generation carries richer information than aggregate statistics alone. Analyzing token-level entropy trajectories, we identify characteristic patterns distinguishing correct from incorrect reasoning: erroneous solutions exhibit unstable dynamics, including burst spikes (sustained uncertainty growth) and peak-valley spikes (sharp rebounds following transient confidence). These patterns persist across models and training stages, suggesting they reflect intrinsic properties of reasoning failure rather than superficial noise. To formalize this observation, we introduce the Entropy Dynamics Instability Score (\textbf{EDIS}), a trajectory-level metric quantifying instability in entropy evolution. EDIS serves as an effective diagnostic signal for inference-time selection, substantially improving reasoning accuracy, and offers a promising direction for training-time sample curation. Our findings establish entropy dynamics as an underexplored yet informative lens for understanding and improving LLM reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01289v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis by progressively estimating a smooth transition from a Gaussian distribution of noise to a real image. Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate episodic Markov Decision Processes with heavy-tailed feedback (HTMDPs). Existing approaches for HTMDPs are conservative in stochastic environments and lack adaptivity in adversarial regimes. In this work, we propose algorithms ```HT-FTRL-OM``` and ```HT-FTRL-UOB``` for HTMDPs that achieve Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) guarantees: instance-independent regret in adversarial environments and logarithmic instance-dependent regret in self-bounding (including the stochastic case) environments. For the known transition setting, ```HT-FTRL-OM``` applies the Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework over occupancy measures with novel skipping loss estimators, achieving a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{1/\alpha})$ regret bound in adversarial regimes and a $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in stochastic regimes. Building upon this framework, we develop a novel algorithm ```HT-FTRL-UOB``` to tackle the more challenging unknown-transition setting. This algorithm employs a pessimistic skipping loss estimator and achieves a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{1/\alpha} + \sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial regimes and a $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(T))$ regret in stochastic regimes. Our analysis overcomes key barriers through several technical insights, including a local control mechanism for heavy-tailed shifted losses, a new suboptimal-mass propagation principle, and a novel regret decomposition that isolates transition uncertainty from heavy-tailed estimation errors and skipping bias.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01308v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work investigates the optimization instability of deep neural networks from a less-explored yet insightful perspective: the emergence and amplification of singularities in the parametric space. Our analysis reveals that parametric singularities inevitably grow with gradient updates and further intensify alignment with representations, leading to increased singularities in the representation space. We show that the gradient Frobenius norms are bounded by the top singular values of the weight matrices, and as training progresses, the mutually reinforcing growth of weight and representation singularities, termed the curse of singularities, relaxes these bounds, escalating the risk of sharp loss explosions. To counter this, we propose Parametric Singularity Smoothing (PSS), a lightweight, flexible, and effective method for smoothing the singular spectra of weight matrices. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, architectures, and optimizers demonstrate that PSS mitigates instability, restores trainability even after failure, and improves both training efficiency and generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01312v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data attribution, tracing a model's prediction back to specific training data, is an important tool for interpreting sophisticated AI models. The widely used TRAK algorithm addresses this challenge by first approximating the underlying model with a kernel machine and then leveraging techniques developed for approximating the leave-one-out (ALO) risk. Despite its strong empirical performance, the theoretical conditions under which the TRAK approximations are accurate as well as the regimes in which they break down remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the TRAK algorithm, characterizing its performance and quantifying the errors introduced by the approximations on which the method relies. We show that although the approximations incur significant errors, TRAK's estimated influence remains highly correlated with the original influence and therefore largely preserves the relative ranking of data points. We corroborate our theoretical results through extensive simulations and empirical studies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether "Starbucks" arises from the composition of "star" and "coffee" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10$\times$ larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency ($r = 0.06$ vs. $r = 0.82$ for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01338v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present algorithms for diffusion model sampling which obtain $\delta$-error in $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta)$ steps, given access to $\widetilde O(\delta)$-accurate score estimates in $L^2$. This is an exponential improvement over all previous results. Specifically, under minimal data assumptions, the complexity is $\widetilde O(d\,\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta))$ where $d$ is the dimension of the data; under a non-uniform $L$-Lipschitz condition, the complexity is $\widetilde O(\sqrt{dL}\,\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta))$; and if the data distribution has intrinsic dimension $d_\star$, then the complexity reduces to $\widetilde O(d_\star\,\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta))$. Our approach also yields the first $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\delta)$ complexity sampler for general log-concave distributions using only gradient evaluations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We provide the first study of the problem of finding differentially private (DP) second-order stationary points (SOSP) in stochastic (non-convex) minimax optimization. Existing literature either focuses only on first-order stationary points for minimax problems or on SOSP for classical stochastic minimization problems. This work provides, for the first time, a unified and detailed treatment of both empirical and population risks. Specifically, we propose a purely first-order method that combines a nested gradient descent--ascent scheme with SPIDER-style variance reduction and Gaussian perturbations to ensure privacy. A key technical device is a block-wise ($q$-period) analysis that controls the accumulation of stochastic variance and privacy noise without summing over the full iteration horizon, yielding a unified treatment of both empirical-risk and population formulations. Under standard smoothness, Hessian-Lipschitzness, and strong concavity assumptions, we establish high-probability guarantees for reaching an $(\alpha,\sqrt{\rho_\Phi \alpha})$-approximate second-order stationary point with $\alpha = \mathcal{O}( (\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3})$ for empirical risk objectives and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}} + (\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon})^{1/2})$ for population objectives, matching the best known rates for private first-order stationarity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-play post-training methods has emerged as an effective approach for finetuning large language models and turn the weak language model into strong language model without preference data. However, the theoretical foundations for self-play finetuning remain underexplored. In this work, we tackle this by connecting self-play finetuning with adversarial imitation learning by formulating finetuning procedure as a min-max game between the model and a regularized implicit reward player parameterized by the model itself. This perspective unifies self-play imitation and general preference alignment within a common framework. Under this formulation, we present a game-theoretic analysis showing that the self-play finetuning will converge to it's equilibrium. Guided by this theoretical formulation, we propose a new self-play imitation finetuning algorithm based on the $\chi^2$-divergence variational objective with bounded rewards and improved stability. Experiments on various of language model finetuning tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over existing self-play methods and validate our theoretical insights.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although recent studies on time-series anomaly detection have increasingly adopted ever-larger neural network architectures such as transformers and foundation models, they incur high computational costs and memory usage, making them impractical for real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Moreover, they often fail to demonstrate significant performance gains over simpler methods under rigorous evaluation protocols. In this study, we propose Patch-based representation learning for time-series Anomaly detection (PaAno), a lightweight yet effective method for fast and efficient time-series anomaly detection. PaAno extracts short temporal patches from time-series training data and uses a 1D convolutional neural network to embed each patch into a vector representation. The model is trained using a combination of triplet loss and pretext loss to ensure the embeddings capture informative temporal patterns from input patches. During inference, the anomaly score at each time step is computed by comparing the embeddings of its surrounding patches to those of normal patches extracted from the training time-series. Evaluated on the TSB-AD benchmark, PaAno achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods, including those based on heavy architectures, on both univariate and multivariate time-series anomaly detection across various range-wise and point-wise performance measures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01365v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a key technique for improving reasoning abilities in large language models, yet its behavior under different domain sequencing strategies is poorly understood. In particular, the impact of sequential (one domain at a time) versus mixed-domain (multiple domain at a time) training in GRPO has not been systematically studied. We provide the first systematic analysis of training-order effects across math, science, logic, and puzzle reasoning tasks. We found (1) single-domain generalization is highly asymmetric: training on other domains improves math reasoning by approximately 25\% accuracy, while yielding negligible transfer to logic and puzzle; (2) cross-domain interactions are highly order-dependent: training in the order math$\rightarrow$science achieves 83\% / 41\% accuracy on math / science, while reversing the order to science$\rightarrow$math degrades performance to 77\% / 25\%; (3) no single strategy is universally optimal in multi-domain training: sequential training favors math (up to 84\%), mixed training favors science and logic, and poor ordering can incur large performance gaps (from 70\% to 56\%). Overall, our findings demonstrate that GRPO under multi-domain settings exhibits pronounced asymmetry, order sensitivity, and strategy dependence, highlighting the necessity of domain-aware and order-aware training design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01367v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Survival analysis is essential for clinical decision-making, as it allows practitioners to estimate time-to-event outcomes, stratify patient risk profiles, and guide treatment planning. Deep learning has revolutionized this field with unprecedented predictive capabilities but faces a fundamental trade-off between performance and interpretability. While neural networks achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. Conversely, deep clustering-based methods that stratify patients into interpretable risk groups typically sacrifice predictive power. We propose CONVERSE (CONtrastive Variational Ensemble for Risk Stratification and Estimation), a deep survival model that bridges this gap by unifying variational autoencoders with contrastive learning for interpretable risk stratification. CONVERSE combines variational embeddings with multiple intra- and inter-cluster contrastive losses. Self-paced learning progressively incorporates samples from easy to hard, improving training stability. The model supports cluster-specific survival heads, enabling accurate ensemble predictions. Comprehensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that CONVERSE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing deep survival methods, while maintaining meaningful patient stratification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Shapley value is a ubiquitous framework for attribution in machine learning, encompassing feature importance, data valuation, and causal inference. However, its exact computation is generally intractable, necessitating efficient approximation methods. While the most effective and popular estimators leverage the paired sampling heuristic to reduce estimation error, the theoretical mechanism driving this improvement has remained opaque. In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace. By utilizing the Fourier basis to isolate this subspace and employing a proxy model to identify high-impact interactions, OddSHAP overcomes the combinatorial explosion of higher-order approximations. Through an extensive benchmark evaluation, we find that OddSHAP achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01410v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) efficiently while preserving model quality poses significant challenges, particularly with subbyte precision supported by state-of-the-art GPUs. Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets. Experiments on 1B, 3B, 7B and 70B Llama-like models demonstrate that SNIP consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing FLOPs by up to 80% while preserving model quality across different model sizes and training phases with minimal computational overhead.

It suffers from limited dataset availability in industry, reducing model generalization. We propose a semi-supervised learning approach to improve transformer-based CAPP transformer models without manual labeling. An oracle, trained on available transformer behaviour data, filters correct predictions from unseen parts, which are then used for one-shot retraining. Experiments on small-scale datasets with simulated ground truth across the full data distribution show consistent accuracy gains over baselines, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in data-scarce manufacturing environments.

Speculative sampling accelerates inference, with efficiency improving as the acceptance rate between draft and target models increases. Yet recent work reveals a fundamental trade-off: higher watermark strength reduces acceptance, preventing their simultaneous achievement. We revisit this trade-off and show it is not absolute. We introduce a quantitative measure of watermark strength that governs statistical detectability and is maximized when tokens are deterministic functions of pseudorandom numbers. Using this measure, we fully characterize the trade-off as a constrained optimization problem and derive explicit Pareto curves for two existing watermarking schemes. Finally, we introduce a principled mechanism that injects pseudorandomness into draft-token acceptance, ensuring maximal watermark strength while maintaining speculative sampling efficiency. Experiments further show that this approach improves detectability without sacrificing efficiency. Our findings uncover a principle that unites speculative sampling and watermarking, paving the way for their efficient and practical deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01433v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time series in domains such as finance, climate science, and healthcare often exhibit long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and short-term fluctuations, complicating causal inference under non-stationarity and autocorrelation. Existing causal discovery methods typically operate on raw observations, making them vulnerable to spurious edges and misattributed temporal dependencies. We introduce a decomposition-based causal discovery framework that separates each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and performs component-specific causal analysis. Trend components are assessed using stationarity tests, seasonal components using kernel-based dependence measures, and residual components using constraint-based causal discovery. The resulting component-level graphs are integrated into a unified multi-scale causal structure. This approach isolates long- and short-range causal effects, reduces spurious associations, and improves interpretability. Across extensive synthetic benchmarks and real-world climate data, our framework more accurately recovers ground-truth causal structure than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under strong non-stationarity and temporal autocorrelation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01434v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: According to a popular viewpoint, neural networks learn from data by first identifying low-dimensional representations, and subsequently fitting the best model in this space. Recent works provide a formalization of this phenomenon when learning multi-index models. In this setting, we are given $n$ i.i.d. pairs $({\boldsymbol x}_i,y_i)$, where the covariate vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are isotropic, and responses $y_i$ only depend on ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ through a $k$-dimensional projection ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*^{{\sf T}}{\boldsymbol x}_i$. Feature learning amounts to learning the latent space spanned by ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*$.   In this context, we study the gradient descent dynamics of two-layer neural networks under the proportional asymptotics $n,d\to\infty$, $n/d\to\delta$, while the dimension of the latent space $k$ and the number of hidden neurons $m$ are kept fixed. Earlier work establishes that feature learning via polynomial-time algorithms is possible if $\delta> \delta_{\text{alg}}$, for $\delta_{\text{alg}}$ a threshold depending on the data distribution, and is impossible (within a certain class of algorithms) below $\delta_{\text{alg}}$. Here we derive an analogous threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ for two-layer networks. Our characterization of $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ opens the way to study the dependence of learning dynamics on the network architecture and training algorithm.   The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ is determined by the following scenario. Training first visits points for which the gradient of the empirical risk is large and learns the directions spanned by these gradients. Then the gradient becomes smaller and the dynamics becomes dominated by negative directions of the Hessian. The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ corresponds to a phase transition in the spectrum of the Hessian in this second phase.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01437v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The problem of corrupted data, missing features, or missing modalities continues to plague the modern machine learning landscape. To address this issue, a class of regularization methods that enforce consistency between imputed and fully observed data has emerged as a promising approach for improving model generalization, particularly in partially observed settings. We refer to this class of methods as Measure Consistency Regularization (MCR). Despite its empirical success in various applications, such as image inpainting, data imputation and semi-supervised learning, a fundamental understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of MCR remains limited. This paper bridges this gap by offering theoretical insights into why, when, and how MCR enhances imputation quality under partial observability, viewed through the lens of neural network distance.   Our theoretical analysis identifies the term responsible for MCR's generalization advantage and extends to the imperfect training regime, demonstrating that this advantage is not always guaranteed. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel training protocol that monitors the duality gap to determine an early stopping point that preserves the generalization benefit. We then provide detailed empirical evidence to support our theoretical claims and to show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed stopping condition. We further provide a set of real-world data simulations to show the versatility of MCR under different model architectures designed for different data sources.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite scale driving substantial recent advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) methods still primarily use small value functions. Naively scaling value functions -- including with a transformer architecture, which is known to be highly scalable -- often results in learning instability and worse performance. In this work, we ask what prevents transformers from scaling effectively for value functions? Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01442v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Removing ''important'' high-gradient components from a neural network can improve generalization, while removing unimportant'' low-gradient components can destroy it. We demonstrate this paradox by formalizing the \textit{Gradient-Causal Gap} in Transformers trained on algorithmic tasks. While gradient magnitude and causal importance align on simple tasks ($\rho=0.73$ for reversal), this relationship collapses as task complexity increases ($\rho=0.32$ for sorting), sometimes becoming inverted ($\rho=-0.11$). Pruning experiments reveal that gradient magnitude is not merely inaccurate but \textit{unpredictably} so. Removing low-gradient ''Hidden Heroes'' consistently devastates OOD accuracy ($-32\%$). Removing high-gradient ''Gradient Bloats'' is a coin flip: harmless in most seeds (indicating optimization noise), catastrophic in others (indicating overfitting circuits). This unpredictability means gradient-based pruning cannot reliably preserve model capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01445v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a central role in the performance of deep learning models, yet remains computationally expensive and difficult to interpret, particularly for time-series forecasting. While Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a standard approach, it typically treats tuning tasks independently and provides limited insight into its decisions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to incorporate structured prior knowledge and reasoning into optimization pipelines. We introduce LLM-AutoOpt, a hybrid HPO framework that combines BO with LLM-based contextual reasoning. The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts, using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects. This design enables context-aware and stable hyperparameter refinement while exposing the reasoning behind optimization decisions. Experiments on a multivariate time series forecasting benchmark demonstrate that LLM-AutoOpt achieves improved predictive performance and more interpretable optimization behavior compared to BO and LLM baselines without meta-knowledge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01453v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning in the setting of reward-free exploration, where multiple agents jointly explore an unknown MDP in order to learn its dynamics (without observing rewards). We focus on a tabular finite-horizon MDP and adopt a phased learning framework. In each learning phase, multiple agents independently interact with the environment. More specifically, in each learning phase, each agent is assigned a policy, executes it, and observes the resulting trajectory. Our primary goal is to characterize the tradeoff between the number of learning phases and the number of agents, especially when the number of learning phases is small.   Our results identify a sharp transition governed by the horizon $H$. When the number of learning phases equals $H$, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that uses only $\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \epsilon^2)$ agents to obtain an $\epsilon$ approximation of the dynamics (i.e., yields an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for any reward function). We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that any algorithm restricted to $\rho < H$ phases requires at least $A^{H/\rho}$ agents to achieve constant accuracy. Thus, we show that it is essential to have an order of $H$ learning phases if we limit the number of agents to be polynomial.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate how the topology of attributed graphs influences the distribution of node attributes. This work offers a novel perspective by treating topology and attributes as structurally distinct but interacting components. We introduce an algebraic approach that combines a graph's topology with the probability distribution of node attributes, resulting in topology-influenced distributions. First, we develop a categorical framework to formalize how a node perceives the graph's topology. We then quantify this point of view and integrate it with the distribution of node attributes to capture topological effects. We interpret these topology-conditioned distributions as approximations of the posteriors $P(\cdot \mid v)$ and $P(\cdot \mid \mathcal{G})$.   We further establish a principled sufficiency condition by showing that, on complete graphs, where topology carries no informative structure, our construction recovers the original attribute distribution. To evaluate our approach, we introduce an intentionally simple testbed model, $\textbf{ID}$, and use unsupervised graph anomaly detection as a probing task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) learn view-invariant representations and admit projection-based distribution matching for collapse prevention. Existing approaches regularize representations towards isotropic Gaussian distributions, but inherently favor dense representations and fail to capture the key property of sparsity observed in efficient representations. We introduce Rectified Distribution Matching Regularization (RDMReg), a sliced two-sample distribution-matching loss that aligns representations to a Rectified Generalized Gaussian (RGG) distribution. RGG enables explicit control over expected $\ell_0$ norm through rectification, while preserving maximum-entropy up to rescaling under expected $\ell_p$ norm constraints. Equipping JEPAs with RDMReg yields Rectified LpJEPA, which strictly generalizes prior Gaussian-based JEPAs. Empirically, Rectified LpJEPA learns sparse, non-negative representations with favorable sparsity-performance trade-offs and competitive downstream performance on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating that RDMReg effectively enforces sparsity while preserving task-relevant information.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01468v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-attention has greatly contributed to the success of the widely used Transformer architecture by enabling learning from data with long-range dependencies. In an effort to improve performance, a gated attention model that leverages a gating mechanism within the multi-head self-attention has recently been proposed as a promising alternative. Gated attention has been empirically demonstrated to increase the expressiveness of low-rank mapping in standard attention and even to eliminate the attention sink phenomenon. Despite its efficacy, a clear theoretical understanding of gated attention's benefits remains lacking in the literature. To close this gap, we rigorously show that each entry in a gated attention matrix or a multi-head self-attention matrix can be written as a hierarchical mixture of experts. By recasting learning as an expert estimation problem, we demonstrate that gated attention is more sample-efficient than multi-head self-attention. In particular, while the former needs only a polynomial number of data points to estimate an expert, the latter requires exponentially many data points to achieve the same estimation error. Furthermore, our analysis also provides a theoretical justification for why gated attention yields higher performance when a gate is placed at the output of the scaled dot product attention or the value map rather than at other positions in the multi-head self-attention architecture.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01469v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning LLMs produce longer outputs, requiring speculative decoding drafters trained on extended sequences. Parallel drafting - predicting multiple tokens per forward pass - offers latency benefits over sequential generation, but training complexity scales quadratically with the product of sequence length and parallel positions, rendering long-context training impractical. We present P(arallel)-EAGLE, which transforms EAGLE from autoregressive to parallel multi-token prediction via a learnable shared hidden state. To scale training to long contexts, we develop a framework featuring attention mask pre-computation and sequence partitioning techniques, enabling gradient accumulation within individual sequences for parallel-prediction training. We implement P-EAGLE in vLLM and demonstrate speedups of 1.10-1.36x over autoregressive EAGLE-3 across GPT-OSS 120B, 20B, and Qwen3-Coder 30B.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01480v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How can we understand gradient-based training over non-convex landscapes? The edge of stability phenomenon, introduced in Cohen et al. (2021), indicates that the answer is not so simple: namely, gradient descent (GD) with large step sizes often diverges away from the gradient flow. In this regime, the "Central Flow", recently proposed in Cohen et al. (2025), provides an accurate ODE approximation to the GD dynamics over many architectures. In this work, we propose Rod Flow, an alternative ODE approximation, which carries the following advantages: (1) it rests on a principled derivation stemming from a physical picture of GD iterates as an extended one-dimensional object -- a "rod"; (2) it better captures GD dynamics for simple toy examples and matches the accuracy of Central Flow for representative neural network architectures, and (3) is explicit and cheap to compute. Theoretically, we prove that Rod Flow correctly predicts the critical sharpness threshold and explains self-stabilization in quartic potentials. We validate our theory with a range of numerical experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose causal preference elicitation, a Bayesian framework for expert-in-the-loop causal discovery that actively queries local edge relations to concentrate a posterior over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). From any black-box observational posterior, we model noisy expert judgments with a three-way likelihood over edge existence and direction. Posterior inference uses a flexible particle approximation, and queries are selected by an efficient expected information gain criterion on the expert's categorical response. Experiments on synthetic graphs, protein signaling data, and a human gene perturbation benchmark show faster posterior concentration and improved recovery of directed effects under tight query budgets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a critical avenue for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01486v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in data-driven surrogates for dynamical systems that can be orders of magnitude faster than numerical solvers. However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving diverse partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental in science and engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, symbolic reasoning, and tool use, but reliably solving PDEs across heterogeneous settings remains challenging. Prior work on LLM-based code generation and transformer-based foundation models for PDE learning has shown promising advances. However, a persistent trade-off between execution success rate and numerical accuracy arises, particularly when generalization to unseen parameters and boundary conditions is required. In this work, we propose OpInf-LLM, an LLM parametric PDE solving framework based on operator inference. The proposed framework leverages a small amount of solution data to enable accurate prediction of diverse PDE instances, including unseen parameters and configurations, and provides seamless integration with LLMs for natural language specification of PDE solving tasks. Its low computational demands and unified tool interface further enable a high execution success rate across heterogeneous settings. By combining operator inference with LLM capabilities, OpInf-LLM opens new possibilities for generalizable reduced-order modeling in LLM-based PDE solving.

Our approach applies STORM (STOchastic Recursive Momentum) to reduce variance in the critic updates. However, because samples are drawn from a nonstationary occupancy measure induced by the evolving policy, variance reduction via STORM alone is insufficient. To address this challenge, we maintain a buffer of small fraction of recent samples and uniformly sample from it for each critic update. Importantly, these mechanisms are compatible with existing deep learning architectures and require only minor modifications, without compromising practical applicability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01510v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Genetic programming-based feature construction has achieved significant success in recent years as an automated machine learning technique to enhance learning performance. However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.

The ensemble dynamics are maintained as a fully traversable symbolic graph in CasADi, enabling maximal runtime auditability. Synchronous simulation validates rapid adaptation (~7.3 ms) and near-ideal tracking fidelity under compound regime shifts (friction, mass, drag) where non-adaptive baselines fail. Empirical benchmarking quantifies the transparency cost: symbolic graph maintenance increases solver latency by 72-102X versus compiled parametric physics models, establishing the efficiency price of strict white-box implementation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache of Large Language Models (LLMs) is prefix-based, making it highly inefficient for processing contexts retrieved in arbitrary order. Position-Independent Caching (PIC) has been proposed to enable KV reuse without positional constraints; however, existing approaches often incur substantial accuracy degradation, limiting their practical adoption. To address this issue, we propose native PIC by reintroducing the encoder to prevalent decoder-only LLMs and explicitly training it to support PIC. We further develop COMB, a PIC-aware caching system that integrates seamlessly with existing inference frameworks. Experimental results show that COMB reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 51-94% and increases throughput by 3$\times$ with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, the quality improvement when using DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat demonstrates the applicability of COMB to other types of decoder-only LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/shijuzhao/Comb.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01522v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a standard way to adapt multimodal large language models, yet extremely low-rank settings -- especially rank-1 LoRA -- are often unstable. We show that this instability is not solely due to limited capacity: in the rank-1 regime, optimization is highly sensitive to the update direction. Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant "gap" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines. Our results suggest that at the extreme low-rank limit, initial alignment can matter as much as rank itself.

We propose a \emph{relative-budget} theory explaining this variation through a single quantity called relative budget $\xi := H/\mathbb{E}[T]$, where $H$ is the generation horizon (token budget) and $T$ denotes the number of tokens until the first correct solution under a base policy. We show that $\xi$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \emph{deficient} regime ($\xi \to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \emph{balanced} regime ($\xi=\Theta(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \emph{ample} regime ($\xi \to \infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish. We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes. Specifically, in a case study under idealized distributional assumptions, we show that the relative budget grows linearly over iterations. Our empirical results confirm these predictions in realistic settings, identifying a budget $\xi \in [1.5, 2.0]$ that maximizes learning efficiency and coincides with peak reasoning performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized continuous signal modeling, yet they struggle to recover fine-grained details within finite training budgets. While empirical techniques, such as positional encoding (PE), sinusoidal activations (SIREN), and batch normalization (BN), effectively mitigate this, their theoretical justifications are predominantly post hoc, focusing on the global NTK spectrum only after modifications are applied. In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead. Our results demonstrate that this principled remedy enables standard MLPs to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, proving that the key to empowering INRs lies in the structural optimization of the initial rank propagation to effectively populate the latent space.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01553v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Link prediction is a core challenge in graph machine learning, demanding models that capture rich and complex topological dependencies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01554v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image understanding and generation in a single framework, with the visual tokenizer acting as the sole interface that maps visual inputs into tokens for downstream tasks. However, existing shared-token designs are mostly architecture-driven and lack an explicit criterion for what information tokens should preserve to support both understanding and generation. Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization. We integrate InfoTok into three representative unified MLLMs without introducing any additional training data. Experiments show consistent improvements on both understanding and generation, supporting information-regularized tokenization as a principled foundation for learning a shared token space in unified MLLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01558v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term memory mechanisms enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to maintain continuity and personalization across extended interaction lifecycles, but they also introduce new and underexplored risks related to fairness. In this work, we study how implicit bias, defined as subtle statistical prejudice, accumulates and propagates within LLMs equipped with long-term memory. To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time. Extensive experimental results show that DMT substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain bias propagation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the mean-field Langevin descent-ascent (MFL-DA), a coupled optimization dynamics on the space of probability measures for entropically regularized two-player zero-sum games. Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01576v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01581v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) depends on high-quality datasets of human preference labels, which are costly to collect. Although active learning has been studied to improve sample efficiency relative to passive collection, many existing approaches adopt classical experimental design criteria such as G- or D-optimality. These objectives are not tailored to the structure of preference learning, leaving open the design of problem-specific algorithms. In this work, we identify a simple intuition specific to preference learning that calls into question the suitability of these existing design objectives. Motivated by this insight, we propose two active learning algorithms. The first provides the first instance-dependent label complexity guarantee for this setting, and the second is a simple, practical greedy method. We evaluate our algorithm on real-world preference datasets and observe improved sample efficiency compared to existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work shows that linear models can outperform several transformer models in long-term time-series forecasting (TSF). However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01588v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is crucial in real-world applications, where decisions depend on both numerical data and contextual signals. The core challenge is to effectively combine temporal numerical patterns with the context embedded in other modalities, such as text. While most existing methods align textual features with time-series patterns one step at a time, they neglect the multiscale temporal influences of contextual information such as time-series cycles and dynamic shifts. This mismatch between local alignment and global textual context can be addressed by spectral decomposition, which separates time series into frequency components capturing both short-term changes and long-term trends. In this paper, we propose SpecTF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates the effect of textual data on time series in the frequency domain. Our method extracts textual embeddings, projects them into the frequency domain, and fuses them with the time series' spectral components using a lightweight cross-attention mechanism. This adaptively reweights frequency bands based on textual relevance before mapping the results back to the temporal domain for predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecTF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse multi-modal time series datasets while utilizing considerably fewer parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis demonstrated that sparse subnetworks can match full-model performance, suggesting parameter redundancy. Meanwhile, in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), recent work has shown that updates concentrate on a sparse subset of parameters, which further lends evidence to this underlying redundancy. We study the simplest possible way to exploit this redundancy: training only a randomly selected subset of parameters at extreme sparsities. Empirically, we find that training just 1\% of parameters matches or exceeds full-parameter RLVR finetuning across 3 models and 2 task domains. Moreover, different random masks show minimal overlap ($\leq 0.005$ Jaccard similarity) and yet all succeed, suggesting pretrained models contain many viable sparse subnetworks rather than one privileged set. We term this the Multiple Ticket Hypothesis. We explain this phenomenon through the implicit per-step KL constraint in RLVR, which restricts updates to a low-dimensional subspace, enabling arbitrary sparse masks to succeed.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sampling efficiency is a key bottleneck in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GRPO, allocate a fixed number of rollouts for all training prompts. This uniform allocation implicitly treats all prompts as equally informative, and could lead to inefficient computational budget usage and impede training progress. We introduce \Ours, a Variance-Informed Predictive allocation strategy that allocates a given rollout budget to the prompts in the incumbent batch to minimize the expected gradient variance of the policy update. At each iteration, \Ours~uses a lightweight Gaussian process model to predict per-prompt success probabilities based on recent rollouts. These probability predictions are translated into variance estimates, which are then fed into a convex optimization problem to determine the optimal rollout allocations under a hard compute budget constraint. Empirical results show that \Ours~consistently improves sampling efficiency and achieves higher performance than uniform or heuristic allocation strategies in multiple benchmarks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/HieuNT91/VIP.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) leverage extensive pretraining to accurately predict unseen time series during inference, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Through large-scale evaluations on standard benchmarks, we find that leading transformer-based TSFMs exhibit redundant components in their intermediate layers. We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias. Our study sheds light on the universal properties of this emerging class of architectures for continuous-time sequence modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies are expressive yet incur high inference latency. Flow Matching (FM) enables one-step generation, but integrating it into Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) is challenging: the optimal policy is an intractable energy-based distribution, and the efficient log-likelihood estimation required to balance exploration and exploitation suffers from severe discretization bias. We propose \textbf{F}low-based \textbf{L}og-likelihood-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}aximum \textbf{E}ntropy RL (\textbf{FLAME}), a principled framework that addresses these challenges. First, we derive a Q-Reweighted FM objective that bypasses partition function estimation via importance reweighting. Second, we design a decoupled entropy estimator that rigorously corrects bias, which enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Third, we integrate the MeanFlow formulation to achieve expressive and efficient one-step control. Empirical results on MuJoCo show that FLAME outperforms Gaussian baselines and matches multi-step diffusion policies with significantly lower inference cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01611v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are increasingly evaluated as interactive agents, yet standard agent benchmarks conflate two qualitatively distinct sources of success: semantic tool-use and interface-specific interaction pattern memorization. Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01613v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are limited in deployment by GPU memory and inference latency. We present Minima, a production compression pipeline that learns where and how to structurally compress a Transformer and turns that compression into real serving gains. Minima trains a lightweight convolutional predictor to estimate layer- and patch-level sensitivity, applies a mixture of Tucker, tensor-train, and tensor-ring decompositions to low-sensitivity regions, performs a short healing fine-tune, and executes the resulting operators with custom Triton and CUDA kernels. The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB. For a single active request, throughput increases from 40 tokens per second (baseline) to 50 tokens per second (Minima) and 75 tokens per second (Minima with speculative decoding). Under 50 parallel requests, throughput is 34, 44, and 53 tokens per second respectively, showing that Minima remains effective under high concurrency even when speculative decoding gains compress. We position Minima relative to recent tensor-network, low-rank plus quantization, and cross-layer sharing methods, and argue that it is a practical step toward more aggressive structural compression via shared tensor backbones with tiny per-layer adapters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01614v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agroecosystem, which heavily influenced by human actions and accounts for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change and securing environmental sustainability. However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation framework contribute to the development of more accurate and scalable AI-driven agroecosystem models, advancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01619v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) aims to autonomously learn a diverse set of skills without relying on extrinsic rewards. One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated multi-task learning (FMTL) seeks to collaboratively train customized models for users with different tasks while preserving data privacy. Most existing approaches assume model congruity (i.e., the use of fully or partially homogeneous models) across users, which limits their applicability in realistic settings. To overcome this limitation, we aim to learn a shared representation space across tasks rather than shared model parameters. To this end, we propose Muscle loss, a novel contrastive learning objective that simultaneously aligns representations from all participating models. Unlike existing multi-view or multi-model contrastive methods, which typically align models pairwise, Muscle loss can effectively capture dependencies across tasks because its minimization is equivalent to the maximization of mutual information among all the models' representations. Building on this principle, we develop FedMuscle, a practical and communication-efficient FMTL algorithm that naturally handles both model and task heterogeneity. Experiments on diverse image and language tasks demonstrate that FedMuscle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering substantial improvements and robust performance across heterogeneous settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01629v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rigorous uncertainty quantification is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous systems in unconstrained environments. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a distribution-free framework for this task, yet its standard formulations rely on exchangeability assumptions that are violated by the distribution shifts inherent in real-world robotics. Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01635v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is a critical task across various industrial domains. However, capturing temporal dependencies and multivariate correlations within patch-level representation learning remains underexplored, and reliance on single-scale patterns limits the detection of anomalies across different temporal ranges. Furthermore, focusing on normal data representations makes models vulnerable to distribution shifts at inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series anomaly detection (COMET), which consists of three key components: (1) Multi-scale Patch Encoding captures temporal dependencies and inter-variable correlations across multiple patch scales. (2) Vector-Quantized Coreset learns representative normal patterns via codebook and detects anomalies with a dual-score combining quantization error and memory distance. (3) Online Codebook Adaptation generates pseudo-labels based on codebook entries and dynamically adapts the model at inference through contrastive learning. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that COMET achieves the best performance in 36 out of 45 evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness across diverse environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models generate outputs stochastically and may produce fluent but invalid responses, including factual hallucinations. Existing mitigation strategies reduce average error rates but do not provide explicit control over the \emph{frequency} of such failures under repeated use. We formulate inference as a deployment-time risk control problem and introduce \emph{chance-constrained inference}, which directly bounds the probability of hallucinations among accepted generations. Hallucinations are modeled as stochastic constraint violations, and we show that confidence-based selective prediction does not, in general, imply probabilistic risk guarantees. To enforce chance constraints efficiently, we propose a sequential, anytime-valid inference procedure that adaptively certifies feasibility or infeasibility using finite samples, avoiding conservative fixed-sample bounds. Experiments on questions inspired by NaturalQuestions and controlled multi-hop question answering demonstrate reliable risk control, early detection of intrinsically infeasible inputs, and safe composition under repeated use, while confidence-based baselines fail to provide consistent guarantees.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01642v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With limited high-quality data and growing compute, multi-epoch training is gaining back its importance across sub-areas of deep learning. Adam(W), versions of which are go-to optimizers for many tasks such as next token prediction, has two momentum hyperparameters $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$ controlling memory and one very important hyperparameter, batch size, controlling (in particular) the amount mini-batch noise. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand how mini-batch noise influences the implicit bias of memory in Adam (depending on $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) towards sharper or flatter regions of the loss landscape, which is commonly observed to correlate with the generalization gap in multi-epoch training. We find that in the case of large batch sizes, higher $\beta_2$ increases the magnitude of anti-regularization by memory (hurting generalization), but as the batch size becomes smaller, the dependence of (anti-)regulariation on $\beta_2$ is reversed. A similar monotonicity shift (in the opposite direction) happens in $\beta_1$. In particular, the commonly "default" pair $(\beta_1, \beta_2) = (0.9, 0.999)$ is a good choice if batches are small; for larger batches, in many settings moving $\beta_1$ closer to $\beta_2$ is much better in terms of validation accuracy in multi-epoch training. Moreover, our theoretical derivations connect the scale of the batch size at which the shift happens to the scale of the critical batch size. We illustrate this effect in experiments with small-scale data in the about-to-overfit regime.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01643v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecular structure generation from mass spectrometry is fundamental for understanding cellular metabolism and discovering novel compounds. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enables the high-throughput acquisition of fragment fingerprints, these spectra often reflect higher-order interactions involving the concerted cleavage of multiple atoms and bonds-crucial for resolving complex isomers and non-local fragmentation mechanisms. However, most existing methods adopt atom-centric and pairwise interaction modeling, overlooking higher-order edge interactions and lacking the capacity to systematically capture essential many-body characteristics for structure generation. To overcome these limitations, we present MBGen, a Many-Body enhanced diffusion framework for de novo molecular structure Generation from mass spectra. By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation. Further analysis and ablation studies show that our approach effectively captures higher-order interactions and exhibits enhanced sensitivity to complex isomeric and non-local fragmentation information.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01644v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01651v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Why do neural networks fail to generalize addition from 16-digit to 32-digit numbers, while a child who learns the rule can apply it to arbitrarily long sequences? We argue that this failure is not an engineering problem but a violation of physical postulates. Drawing inspiration from physics, we identify three constraints that any generalizing system must satisfy: (1) Locality -- information propagates at finite speed; (2) Symmetry -- the laws of computation are invariant across space and time; (3) Stability -- the system converges to discrete attractors that resist noise accumulation. From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence. Experiments on three tasks validate our theory: (1) Parity -- demonstrating perfect length generalization via light-cone propagation; (2) Addition -- achieving scale-invariant inference from L=16 to L=1 million with 100% accuracy, exhibiting input-adaptive computation; (3) Rule 110 -- learning a Turing-complete cellular automaton without trajectory divergence. Our results suggest that the gap between statistical learning and logical reasoning can be bridged -- not by scaling parameters, but by respecting the physics of computation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01658v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bandit algorithms have recently emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating machine learning models, including generative image models and large language models, by efficiently identifying top-performing candidates without exhaustive comparisons. These methods typically rely on a reward model, often distributed with public weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, to provide feedback to the bandit. While online evaluation is expensive and requires repeated trials, offline evaluation with logged data has become an attractive alternative. However, the adversarial robustness of offline bandit evaluation remains largely unexplored, particularly when an attacker perturbs the reward model (rather than the training data) prior to bandit training. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating, both theoretically and empirically, the vulnerability of offline bandit training to adversarial manipulations of the reward model. We introduce a novel threat model in which an attacker exploits offline data in high-dimensional settings to hijack the bandit's behavior. Starting with linear reward functions and extending to nonlinear models such as ReLU neural networks, we study attacks on two Hugging Face evaluators used for generative model assessment: one measuring aesthetic quality and the other assessing compositional alignment. Our results show that even small, imperceptible perturbations to the reward model's weights can drastically alter the bandit's behavior. From a theoretical perspective, we prove a striking high-dimensional effect: as input dimensionality increases, the perturbation norm required for a successful attack decreases, making modern applications such as image evaluation especially vulnerable. Extensive experiments confirm that naive random perturbations are ineffective, whereas carefully targeted perturbations achieve near-perfect attack success rates ...

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01667v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of quantifying epistemic predictive uncertainty (EPU) -- that is, uncertainty faced at prediction time due to the existence of multiple plausible predictive models -- within the framework of conformal prediction (CP). To expose the implicit model multiplicity underlying CP, we build on recent results showing that, under a mild assumption, any full CP procedure induces a set of closed and convex predictive distributions, commonly referred to as a credal set. Importantly, the conformal prediction region (CPR) coincides exactly with the set of labels to which all distributions in the induced credal set assign probability at least $1-\alpha$. As our first contribution, we prove that this characterisation also holds in split CP. Building on this connection, we then propose a computationally efficient and analytically tractable uncertainty measure, based on \emph{Maximum Mean Imprecision}, to quantify the EPU by measuring the degree of conflicting information within the induced credal set. Experiments on active learning and selective classification demonstrate that the quantified EPU provides substantially more informative and fine-grained uncertainty assessments than reliance on CPR size alone. More broadly, this work highlights the potential of CP serving as a principled basis for decision-making under epistemic uncertainty.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01668v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term multivariate time series forecasting (LTSF) plays a crucial role in various high-performance computing applications, including real-time energy grid management and large-scale traffic flow simulation. However, existing solutions face a dilemma: Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences, while linear State Space Models (SSMs) often struggle to distinguish valuable signals from high-frequency noise, leading to wasted state capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose ASGMamba, an efficient forecasting framework designed for resource-constrained supercomputing environments. ASGMamba integrates a lightweight Adaptive Spectral Gating (ASG) mechanism that dynamically filters noise based on local spectral energy, enabling the Mamba backbone to focus its state evolution on robust temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical multi-scale architecture with variable-specific Node Embeddings to capture diverse physical characteristics. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that ASGMamba achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. While keeping strictly $$\mathcal{O}(L)$$ complexity we significantly reduce the memory usage on long-horizon tasks, thus establishing ASGMamba as a scalable solution for high-throughput forecasting in resource limited environments.The code is available at https://github.com/hit636/ASGMamba

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01682v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study online inverse linear optimization, also known as contextual recommendation, where a learner sequentially infers an agent's hidden objective vector from observed optimal actions over feasible sets that change over time. The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\exp(O(d\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument. Moreover, we extend our approach to adversarially corrupted feedback in up to $C$ rounds. We obtain a regret bound of $O((C+1)d\log d)$ without prior knowledge of $C$, by monitoring directed graphs induced by the observed feedback to detect corruptions adaptively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01685v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly aligned with human preferences using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this method, LLM policies are generally optimized through reward maximization with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization of the reference policy. However, KL and its $f$-divergence variants only compare token probabilities at identical indices, failing to capture semantic similarity. We propose Wasserstein Policy Regularization (WPR), a semantic-aware regularization for the RLHF framework based on the entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, which incorporates the geometry of the token space. The dual formulation of the distance expresses the regularization as penalty terms applied to the reward via optimal dual variables, which yield a tractable objective compatible with standard RL algorithms. Empirically, our method outperforms KL- and $f$-divergence-based baselines, demonstrating the benefits of semantic-aware policy distances for alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01703v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, they unintentionally memorize sensitive data, posing critical privacy and security risks. Machine unlearning is pivotal for mitigating these risks, yet existing paradigms face a fundamental dilemma: aggressive unlearning often induces catastrophic forgetting that degrades model utility, whereas conservative strategies risk superficial forgetting, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial recovery. To address this trade-off, we propose $\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ (Adversarial Gating Training with Adaptive Orthogonality), a unified framework designed to reconcile robust erasure with utility preservation. Specifically, our approach introduces $\textbf{Adaptive Orthogonality (AO)}$ to dynamically mitigate geometric gradient conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives, thereby minimizing unintended knowledge degradation. Concurrently, $\textbf{Adversarial Gating Training (AGT)}$ formulates unlearning as a latent-space min-max game, employing a curriculum-based gating mechanism to simulate and counter internal recovery attempts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ achieves a superior trade-off between unlearning efficacy (KUR $\approx$ 0.01) and model utility (MMLU 58.30).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods improve LLM reasoning by optimizing discrete Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation; however, exploration in token space often suffers from diversity collapse as policy entropy decreases due to mode elicitation behavior in discrete RL. To mitigate this issue, we propose Latent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi-RL), a framework that conducts exploration directly in a continuous latent space, where latent variables encode semantic-level reasoning trajectories. By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalization remains a central yet unresolved challenge in deep learning, particularly the ability to predict a model's performance beyond its training distribution using quantities available prior to test-time evaluation. Building on the large-scale study of Jiang et al. (2020). and concerns by Dziugaite et al. (2020). about instability across training configurations, we benchmark the robustness of generalization measures beyond IID regime. We train small-to-medium models over 10,000 hyperparameter configurations and evaluate more than 40 measures computable from the trained model and the available training data alone. We significantly broaden the experimental scope along multiple axes: (i) extending the evaluation beyond the standard IID setting to include benchmarking for robustness across diverse distribution shifts, (ii) evaluating multiple architectures and training recipes, and (iii) newly incorporating calibration- and information-criteria-based measures to assess their alignment with both IID and OOD generalization. We find that distribution shifts can substantially alter the predictive performance of many generalization measures, while a smaller subset remains comparatively stable across settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01734v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training instability remains a critical challenge in large language model (LLM) pretraining, often manifesting as sudden gradient explosions that waste significant computational resources. We study training failures in a 5M-parameter NanoGPT model scaled via $\mu$P, identifying two key phenomena preceding collapse: (1) rapid decline in weight matrix stable rank (ratio of squared Frobenius norm to squared spectral norm), and (2) increasing alignment between adjacent layer Jacobians. We prove theoretically that these two conditions jointly cause exponential gradient norm growth with network depth. To break this instability mechanism, we propose MSign, a new optimizer that periodically applies matrix sign operations to restore stable rank. Experiments on models from 5M to 3B parameters demonstrate that MSign effectively prevents training failures with a computational overhead of less than 7.0%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01736v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has questioned the effectiveness and robustness of neural network architectures for time series forecasting tasks. We summarize these concerns and analyze groundly their inherent limitations: i.e. the irreconcilable conflict between single (or few similar) domains SOTA and generalizability over general domains for time series forecasting neural network architecture designs. Moreover, neural networks architectures for general domain time series forecasting are becoming more and more complicated and their performance has almost saturated in recent years. As a result, network architectures developed aiming at fitting general time series domains are almost not inspiring for real world practices for certain single (or few similar) domains such as Finance, Weather, Traffic, etc: each specific domain develops their own methods that rarely utilize advances in neural network architectures of time series community in recent 2-3 years. As a result, we call for the time series community to shift focus away from research on time series neural network architectures for general domains: these researches have become saturated and away from domain-specific SOTAs over time. We should either (1) focus on deep learning methods for certain specific domain(s), or (2) turn to the development of meta-learning methods for general domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01744v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While linear attention reduces the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers to linear time, it often lags behind in expressivity due to the removal of softmax normalization. This omission eliminates \emph{global competition}, a critical mechanism that enables models to sharply focus on relevant information amidst long-context noise. In this work, we propose \textbf{Softmax Linear Attention (SLA)}, a framework designed to restore this competitive selection without sacrificing efficiency. By lifting the softmax operation from the token level to the head level, SLA leverages attention heads as coarse semantic slots, applying a competitive gating mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant subspaces. This reintroduces the ``winner-take-all'' dynamics essential for precise retrieval and robust long-context understanding. Distinct from prior methods that focus on refining local kernel functions, SLA adopts a broader perspective by exploiting the higher-level multi-head aggregation structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLA consistently enhances state-of-the-art linear baselines (RetNet, GLA, GDN) across language modeling and long-context benchmarks, particularly in challenging retrieval scenarios where it significantly boosts robustness against noise, validating its capability to restore precise focus while maintaining linear complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01745v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Token-level reweighting is a simple yet effective mechanism for controlling supervised fine-tuning, but common indicators are largely one-dimensional: the ground-truth probability reflects downstream alignment, while token entropy reflects intrinsic uncertainty induced by the pre-training prior. Ignoring entropy can misidentify noisy or easily replaceable tokens as learning-critical, while ignoring probability fails to reflect target-specific alignment. RankTuner introduces a probability--entropy calibration signal, the Relative Rank Indicator, which compares the rank of the ground-truth token with its expected rank under the prediction distribution. The inverse indicator is used as a token-wise Relative Scale to reweight the fine-tuning objective, focusing updates on truly under-learned tokens without over-penalizing intrinsically uncertain positions. Experiments on multiple backbones show consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, transfer gains on out-of-distribution reasoning, and pre code generation performance over probability-only or entropy-only reweighting baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01746v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for federated fine-tuning. Yet under non-IID settings, it can substantially underperform full-parameter fine-tuning. Through with-high-probability robustness analysis, we uncover that this gap can be attributed to two coupled mismatches: (i) update-space mismatch, where clients optimize in a low-rank subspace but aggregation occurs in the full space; and (ii) optimizer-state mismatch, where unsynchronized adaptive states amplify drift across rounds. We propose FedGaLore, which combines client-side GaLore-style gradient-subspace optimization with server-side drift-robust synchronization of projected second-moment states via spectral shared-signal extraction, to address this challenge. Across NLU, vision, and NLG benchmarks, FedGaLore improves robustness and accuracy over state-of-the-art federated LoRA baselines in non-IID settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is essential for safe pharmacological treatments. Previous graph neural network (GNN) models leverage molecular structures and interaction networks but mostly rely on linear aggregation and symmetric assumptions, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous patterns. We propose MGKAN, a Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that introduces learnable basis functions into asymmetric DDI prediction. MGKAN replaces conventional MLP transformations with KAN-driven basis functions, enabling more expressive and nonlinear modeling of drug relationships. To capture pharmacological dependencies, MGKAN integrates three network views-an asymmetric DDI network, a co-interaction network, and a biochemical similarity network-with role-specific embeddings to preserve directional semantics. A fusion module combines linear attention and nonlinear transformation to enhance representational capacity. On two benchmark datasets, MGKAN outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies and case studies confirm its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in modeling directional drug effects.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers serve as the foundation of most modern large language models. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The quadratic complexity and indefinitely growing key-value (KV) cache of standard Transformers pose a major barrier to long-context processing. To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/comet-B00B/

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01769v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hallucination remains a fundamental challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a key alignment framework, existing approaches often rely heavily on costly external evaluators for scoring or rewriting, incurring off-policy learnability gaps and discretization loss. Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation.   To address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment. These results confirm that IRIS provides an efficient and principled paradigm for mitigating MLLM hallucinations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01772v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has established itself as a cornerstone of proteomic profiling and large-scale systems biology, offering unparalleled depth and reproducibility. Current DIA analysis frameworks, however, require semi-supervised training within each run for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) re-scoring. This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting has traditionally been formulated as a model-centric, static, and single-pass prediction problem that maps historical observations to future values. While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01777v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic gradient methods are central to large-scale learning, yet their analysis typically treats mini-batch gradients as unbiased estimators of the population gradient. In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in complex LLM reasoning within verifiable domains, such as mathematics and programming. Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01826v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training Large Language Models is notoriously unstable. While recent studies attribute this to "training inference mismatch stemming" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01828v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many complex networks exhibit hyperbolic structural properties, making hyperbolic space a natural candidate for representing hierarchical and tree-like graphs with low distortion. Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking "Is the graph hyperbolic?" to also questioning "Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01839v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, data-centric AI methodology has been a dominant paradigm in single-cell transcriptomics analysis, which treats data representation rather than model complexity as the fundamental bottleneck. In the review of current studies, earlier sequence methods treat cells as independent entities and adapt prevalent ML models to analyze their directly inherited sequence data. Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge. This omission incurs substantial overhead and yields suboptimal graph representations, thereby hindering the utility of ML models.   To address them, we propose DOGMA, a holistic data-centric framework designed for the structural reshaping and semantic enhancement of raw data through multi-level biological prior knowledge. Transcending reliance on stochastic heuristics, DOGMA redefines graph construction by integrating Statistical Anchors with Cell Ontology and Phylogenetic Trees to enable deterministic structure discovery and robust cross-species alignment. Furthermore, Gene Ontology is utilized to bridge the feature-level semantic gap by incorporating functional priors. In complex multi-species and multi-organ benchmarks, DOGMA achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot robustness and sample efficiency while operating with significantly lower computational cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01842v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference-time compute has re-emerged as a practical way to improve LLM reasoning. Most test-time scaling (TTS) algorithms rely on autoregressive decoding, which is ill-suited to discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) due to their parallel decoding over the entire sequence. As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) face a fundamental divide: masked language models (MLMs) excel at fitness prediction while causal models enable generation, forcing practitioners to maintain separate architectures. We introduce \textbf{Proust}, a 309M-parameter causal PLM that bridges this gap through architectural innovations adapted from recent LLM research, including grouped-query attention with shared K/V projections, cross-layer value residuals, and depthwise causal convolutions. Trained on 33B tokens in 40 B200 GPU-hours, Proust achieves Spearman $\rho = 0.390$ on ProteinGym substitutions, competitive with MLMs requiring 50--200$\times$ the compute. On indels, Proust sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming models up to 20$\times$ larger. On EVEREST viral fitness benchmarks, it approaches structure-aware methods using sequence alone. These powerful representations position Proust in a sweet spot as it also retains native generative capabilities that MLMs lack by design. Interpretability analysis reveals that per-position entropy variance predicts, to an extent, when retrieval augmentation helps and hurts. Such insights can grow in both quantity and quality at scale and inform capabilities such as test-time scaling. Code and weights are available at https://github.com/Furkan9015/proust-inference

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01849v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an inference-time scaling algorithm enabling effective sampling of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on a confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to a noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/self-rewarding-smc.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01852v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01853v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A/B testing has become a gold standard for modern technological companies to conduct policy evaluation. Yet, its application to time series experiments, where policies are sequentially assigned over time, remains challenging. Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and responsive myoelectric prosthesis control typically relies on complex, dense multi-sensor arrays, which limits consumer accessibility. This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing. The proposed framework offers a robust, cost-effective blueprint for next-generation prosthetic interfaces capable of rapid personalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Models that directly optimize for out-of-sample performance in the finite-sample regime have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional estimate-then-optimize approaches in data-driven optimization. In this work, we compare their performance in the context of autocorrelated uncertainties, specifically, under a Vector Autoregressive Moving Average VARMA(p,q) process. We propose an autocorrelated Optimize-via-Estimate (A-OVE) model that obtains an out-of-sample optimal solution as a function of sufficient statistics, and propose a recursive form for computing its sufficient statistics. We evaluate these models on a portfolio optimization problem with trading costs. A-OVE achieves low regret relative to a perfect information oracle, outperforming predict-then-optimize machine learning benchmarks. Notably, machine learning models with higher accuracy can have poorer decision quality, echoing the growing literature in data-driven optimization. Performance is retained under small mis-specification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01897v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent answers that are unfaithful to the provided context, while many safeguards rely on external verification or a separate judge after generation. We introduce \emph{internal flow signatures} that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact \emph{moving} readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. \emph{Code is available at} \texttt{github.com/EavnJeong/Internal-Flow-Signatures-for-Self-Checking-and-Refinement-in-LLMs}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01898v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian active learning relies on the precise quantification of predictive uncertainty to explore unknown function landscapes. While Gaussian process surrogates are the standard for such tasks, an underappreciated fact is that their posterior variance depends on the observed outputs only through the hyperparameters, rendering exploration largely insensitive to the actual measurements. We propose to inject observation-dependent feedback by warping the input space with a learned, monotone reparameterization. This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions. We demonstrate that while such warps can be trained via marginal likelihood, a novel self-supervised objective yields substantially better performance. Our approach improves sample efficiency across a range of active learning benchmarks, particularly in regimes where non-stationarity challenges traditional methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01903v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work studies online episodic tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with known transitions and develops best-of-both-worlds algorithms that achieve refined data-dependent regret bounds in the adversarial regime and variance-dependent regret bounds in the stochastic regime. We quantify MDP complexity using a first-order quantity and several new data-dependent measures for the adversarial regime, including a second-order quantity and a path-length measure, as well as variance-based measures for the stochastic regime. To adapt to these measures, we develop algorithms based on global optimization and policy optimization, both built on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with log-barrier regularization. For global optimization, our algorithms achieve first-order, second-order, and path-length regret bounds in the adversarial regime, and in the stochastic regime, they achieve a variance-aware gap-independent bound and a variance-aware gap-dependent bound that is polylogarithmic in the number of episodes. For policy optimization, our algorithms achieve the same data- and variance-dependent adaptivity, up to a factor of the episode horizon, by exploiting a new optimistic $Q$-function estimator. Finally, we establish regret lower bounds in terms of data-dependent complexity measures for the adversarial regime and a variance measure for the stochastic regime, implying that the regret upper bounds achieved by the global-optimization approach are nearly optimal.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01914v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Token attribution methods provide intuitive explanations for language model outputs by identifying causally important input tokens. However, as modern LLMs increasingly rely on extended reasoning chains, existing schemes face two critical challenges: (1) efficiency bottleneck, where attributing a target span of M tokens within a context of length N requires O(M*N) operations, making long-context attribution prohibitively slow; and (2) faithfulness drop, where intermediate reasoning tokens absorb attribution mass, preventing importance from propagating back to the original input. To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness. We further analyze the dynamics of recursive attribution, showing that even a single recursive hop improves faithfulness by tracing importance through the reasoning chain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled powerful semantic and multimodal reasoning capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance sample efficiency, high-level planning, and interpretability in reinforcement learning (RL). While prior work has integrated LLMs and VLMs into various components of RL, the replay buffer, a core component for storing and reusing experiences, remains unexplored. We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer. Our key idea is to use a frozen, pre-trained VLM (requiring no fine-tuning) as an automated evaluator to identify and prioritize promising sub-trajectories from the agent's experiences. Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle in class-imbalanced settings, where minority classes are under-represented and predictions are biased toward majorities. We propose \textbf{PIMPC-GNN}, a physics-informed multi-phase consensus framework for imbalanced node classification. Our method integrates three complementary dynamics: (i) thermodynamic diffusion, which spreads minority labels to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) Kuramoto synchronisation, which aligns minority nodes through oscillatory consensus, and (iii) spectral embedding, which separates classes via structural regularisation. These perspectives are combined through class-adaptive ensemble weighting and trained with an imbalance-aware loss that couples balanced cross-entropy with physics-based constraints. Across five benchmark datasets and imbalance ratios from 5-100, PIMPC-GNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving notable gains in minority-class recall (up to +12.7\%) and balanced accuracy (up to +8.3\%). Beyond empirical improvements, the framework also provides interpretable insights into consensus dynamics in graph learning. The code is available at \texttt{https://github.com/afofanah/PIMPC-GNN}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01922v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Over the past years, embedding learning on networks has shown tremendous results in link prediction tasks for complex systems, with a wide range of real-life applications. Learning a representation for each node in a knowledge graph allows us to capture topological and semantic information, which can be processed in downstream analyses later. In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal clinical data are characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneous representations, and structured missingness, posing significant challenges for predictive modeling, data integration, and interpretability. We propose BIONIC (Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical data), a unified probabilistic framework that integrates heterogeneous multimodal data under missingness through a joint generative-discriminative latent architecture. BIONIC uses pretrained embeddings for complex modalities such as medical images and clinical text, while incorporating structured clinical variables directly within a Bayesian multimodal formulation. The proposed framework enables robust learning in partially observed and semi-supervised settings by explicitly modeling modality-level and variable-level missingness, as well as missing labels. We evaluate BIONIC on three multimodal clinical and biomedical datasets, demonstrating strong and consistent discriminative performance compared to representative multimodal baselines, particularly under incomplete data scenarios. Beyond predictive accuracy, BIONIC provides intrinsic interpretability through its latent structure, enabling population-level analysis of modality relevance and supporting clinically meaningful insight.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01935v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01936v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate traffic flow prediction remains a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in cross-domain, data-scarce scenarios where limited historical data hinders model training and generalisation. The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/afofanah/MCPST.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01937v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making across many real-world applications. Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have become widely popular for automated floorplan generation, producing highly realistic layouts conditioned on user-defined constraints. However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01953v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider deep multivariate models for heterogeneous collections of random variables. In the context of computer vision, such collections may e.g. consist of images, segmentations, image attributes, and latent variables. When developing such models, most existing works start from an application task and design the model components and their dependencies to meet the needs of the chosen task. This has the disadvantage of limiting the applicability of the resulting model for other downstream tasks. Here, instead, we propose to represent the joint probability distribution by means of conditional probability distributions for each group of variables conditioned on the rest. Such models can then be used for practically any possible downstream task. Their learning can be approached as training a parametrised Markov chain kernel by maximising the data likelihood of its limiting distribution. This has the additional advantage of allowing a wide range of semi-supervised learning scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01956v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for mitigating hallucinations and enabling risk-aware deployment in safety-critical tasks. However, estimating Epistemic Uncertainty(EU) via Deep Ensembles is computationally prohibitive at the scale of modern models. We propose a framework that leverages the small draft models to efficiently estimate token-level EU, bypassing the need for full-scale ensembling. Theoretically grounded in a Bias-Variance Decomposition, our approach approximates EU via Jensen-Shannon divergence among drafts (variance proxy) and KL divergence between the draft mixture and the target (bias proxy). To further ensure accuracy without significant overhead, we introduce Online Stochastic Distillation (OSD) to efficiently approximate target aggregation and the Data-Diverse Drafts (DDD) strategy to enhance draft diversity for better target approximation. Extensive experiments on GSM8K demonstrate that our method reduces the estimation error (RMSE) by up to 37% compared to baselines. Crucially, our approach achieves Hallucination Detection performance competitive with heavy perturbation-based methods like TokUR while incurring negligible inference costs, offering a practical solution for uncertainty-aware LLM deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01960v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have shown emerging capabilities as zero-shot visual planners, yet video-generated plans often violate temporal consistency and physical constraints, leading to failures when mapped to executable actions. To address this, we propose Grounding Video Plans with World Models (GVP-WM), a planning method that grounds video-generated plans into feasible action sequences using a learned action-conditioned world model. At test-time, GVP-WM first generates a video plan from initial and goal observations, then projects the video guidance onto the manifold of dynamically feasible latent trajectories via video-guided latent collocation. In particular, we formulate grounding as a goal-conditioned latent-space trajectory optimization problem that jointly optimizes latent states and actions under world-model dynamics, while preserving semantic alignment with the video-generated plan. Empirically, GVP-WM recovers feasible long-horizon plans from zero-shot image-to-video-generated and motion-blurred videos that violate physical constraints, across navigation and manipulation simulation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01962v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Off-policy learning methods seek to derive an optimal policy directly from a fixed dataset of prior interactions. This objective presents significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent distributional shift and value function overestimation bias. These issues become even more noticeable in zero-shot reinforcement learning, where an agent trained on reward-free data must adapt to new tasks at test time without additional training. In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks. Our technique seamlessly integrates into forward-backward representation frameworks and enables fast-adaptation to new tasks in a training-free regime. More broadly, this work bridges off-policy learning and zero-shot adaptation, offering benefits to both research areas.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01966v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities, they typically operate as static systems, lacking the ability to evolve through lifelong interaction. Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01975v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but face deployment challenges due to their massive size. Structured pruning offers acceleration benefits but leads to significant performance degradation. Recent PCA-based pruning methods have alleviated this issue by retaining key activation components, but are only applied between modules in order to fuse the transformation matrix, which introduces extra parameters and severely disrupts activation distributions due to residual connections. To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior compression performance compared to recent baselines at the same compression ratio or inference speed.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: General continual learning (GCL) challenges intelligent systems to learn from single-pass, non-stationary data streams without clear task boundaries. While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01990v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance through instruction tuning, but real-world deployment requires them to continually expand their capabilities, making Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) essential. Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate its SOTA performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01996v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become indispensable in many real-life applications like natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works have shown that layer pruning can compress large language models (LLMs) while retaining strong performance on classification benchmarks with little or no finetuning. However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02001v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantization Error Reconstruction (QER) reduces accuracy loss in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) by approximating weights as $\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$, using a rank-$r$ correction to reconstruct quantization error. Prior methods devote the full rank budget to error reconstruction, which is suboptimal when $\mathbf{W}$ has intrinsic low-rank structure and quantization corrupts dominant directions. We propose Structured Residual Reconstruction (SRR), a rank-allocation framework that preserves the top-$k$ singular subspace of the activation-scaled weight before quantization, quantizes only the residual, and uses the remaining rank $r-k$ for error reconstruction. We derive a theory-guided criterion for selecting $k$ by balancing quantization-exposed energy and unrecoverable error under rank constraints. We further show that resulting $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ parameterization naturally supports Quantized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (QPEFT), and stabilizes fine-tuning via gradient scaling along preserved directions. Experiments demonstrate consistent perplexity reductions across diverse models and quantization settings in PTQ, along with a 5.9 percentage-point average gain on GLUE under 2-bit QPEFT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neuro-symbolic systems aim to combine the expressive structure of symbolic logic with the flexibility of neural learning; yet, generative models typically lack mechanisms to enforce declarative constraints at generation time. We propose Logic-Guided Vector Fields (LGVF), a neuro-symbolic framework that injects symbolic knowledge, specified as differentiable relaxations of logical constraints, into flow matching generative models. LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD. Beyond quantitative gains, LGVF yields constraint-aware vector fields exhibiting emergent obstacle-avoidance behavior, routing samples around forbidden regions without explicit path planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02013v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce SNAP (Self-coNsistent Agreement Principle), a self-supervised framework for robust computation based on mutual agreement. Based on an Agreement-Reliability Hypothesis SNAP assigns weights that quantify agreement, emphasizing trustworthy items and downweighting outliers without supervision or prior knowledge. A key result is the Exponential Suppression of Outlier Weights, ensuring that outliers contribute negligibly to computations, even in high-dimensional settings. We study properties of SNAP weighting scheme and show its practical benefits on vector averaging and subspace estimation. Particularly, we demonstrate that non-iterative SNAP outperforms the iterative Weiszfeld algorithm and two variants of multivariate median of means. SNAP thus provides a flexible, easy-to-use, broadly applicable approach to robust computation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02015v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn predictive models that can generalize to unseen domains. Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shampoo is one of the leading approximate second-order optimizers: a variant of it has won the MLCommons AlgoPerf competition, and it has been shown to produce models with lower activation outliers that are easier to compress. Yet, applying Shampoo currently comes at the cost of significant computational slowdown, due to its expensive internal operations. In this paper, we take a significant step to address this shortcoming by proposing \method (for \textbf{D}istributed \textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{SH}ampoo), a faster implementation of Distributed Shampoo based on two main new techniques: First, we show that preconditioner blocks can be stacked into 3D tensors to significantly improve GPU utilization; second, we introduce the Newton-DB iteration and the Chebyshev polynomial approximations as novel and faster approaches for computing the inverse matrix roots required by Shampoo. Along with these algorithmic contributions, we provide a first in-depth analysis of how matrix scaling critically affects Shampoo convergence. On the practical side, our GPU-aware implementation achieves up to $4.83\times$ faster optimizer steps compared to the well-optimized Distributed Shampoo, while Newton-DB attains the lowest validation perplexity per iteration among all tested methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02045v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful learned priors for Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). Diffusion-based solvers rely on a presumed likelihood for the observations in BIPs to guide the generation process. However, the link between likelihood and recovery quality for BIPs is unclear in previous works. We bridge this gap by characterizing the posterior approximation error and proving the \emph{stability} of the diffusion-based solvers. Meanwhile, an immediate result of our findings on stability demonstrates the lack of robustness in diffusion-based solvers, which remains unexplored. This can degrade performance when the presumed likelihood mismatches the unknown true data generation processes. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution, \emph{robust diffusion posterior sampling}, which is provably \emph{robust} and compatible with existing gradient-based posterior samplers. Empirical results on scientific inverse problems and natural image tasks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, showing consistent performance improvements under challenging likelihood misspecifications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training large language models using 4-bit arithmetic enhances throughput and memory efficiency. Yet, the limited dynamic range of FP4 increases sensitivity to outliers. While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with "post-QK" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In Internet-of-Things systems, federated learning has advanced online reinforcement learning (RL) by enabling parallel policy training without sharing raw data. However, interacting with real environments online can be risky and costly, motivating offline federated RL (FRL), where local devices learn from fixed datasets. Despite its promise, offline FRL may break down under low-quality, heterogeneous data. Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $\delta$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees. Extensive experiments show FORLER consistently outperforms strong baselines under varying data quality and heterogeneity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal foundation models integrate heterogeneous signals across modalities, yet it remains poorly understood how their predictions depend on specific internal feature groups and whether such reliance can be deliberately controlled. Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explosive demands for LLMs often cause user queries to accumulate in server queues, requiring efficient routing (query-LLM matching) and scheduling (query prioritization) mechanisms. Several online algorithms are being deployed, but they overlook the following two key challenges inherent to conversational LLM services: (1) unsatisfied users may retry queries, increasing the server backlog, and (2) requests for ``explicit" feedback, such as ratings, degrade user experiences. In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate. We show that ACQB simultaneously achieves a cumulative regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{t})$ for routing and a queue length regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$ for any large $t$. For experiments, we refine query embeddings via contrastive learning while adopting a disjoint parameter model to learn LLM-specific parameters. Experiments on SPROUT, EmbedLLM, and RouterBench datasets confirm that both algorithms consistently outperform baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the performance gains from accelerating quantized matrix multiplication plateau, the softmax operation becomes the critical bottleneck in Transformer inference. This bottleneck stems from two hardware limitations: (1) limited data bandwidth between matrix and vector compute cores, and (2) the significant area cost of high-precision (FP32/16) exponentiation units (EXP2). To address these issues, we introduce a novel low-precision workflow that employs a specific 8-bit floating-point format (HiF8) and block-aware precision rescaling for softmax. Crucially, our algorithmic innovations make low-precision softmax feasible without the significant model accuracy loss that hampers direct low-precision approaches. Specifically, our design (i) halves the required data movement bandwidth by enabling matrix multiplication outputs constrained to 8-bit, and (ii) substantially reduces the EXP2 unit area by computing exponentiations in low (8-bit) precision. Extensive evaluation on language models and multi-modal models confirms the validity of our method. By alleviating the vector computation bottleneck, our work paves the way for doubling end-to-end inference throughput without increasing chip area, and offers a concrete co-design path for future low-precision hardware and software.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02072v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The adaptive smoothing method (ASM) is a widely used approach for traffic state reconstruction. This article presents a Python implementation of ASM, featuring end-to-end calibration using real-world ground truth data. The calibration is formulated as a parameterized kernel optimization problem. The model is calibrated using data from a full-state observation testbed, with input from a sparse radar sensor network. The implementation is developed in PyTorch, enabling integration with various deep learning methods. We evaluate the results in terms of speed distribution, spatio-temporal error distribution, and spatial error to provide benchmark metrics for the traffic reconstruction problem. We further demonstrate the usability of the calibrated method across multiple freeways. Finally, we discuss the challenges of reproducibility in general traffic model calibration and the limitations of ASM. This article is reproducible and can serve as a benchmark for various freeway operation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02079v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating functional source code, raising concerns about authorship, accountability, and security. While detecting AI-generated code is critical, existing datasets and benchmarks are narrow, typically limited to binary human-machine classification under in-distribution settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce $\emph{AICD Bench}$, the most comprehensive benchmark for AI-generated code detection. It spans $\emph{2M examples}$, $\emph{77 models}$ across $\emph{11 families}$, and $\emph{9 programming languages}$, including recent reasoning models. Beyond scale, AICD Bench introduces three realistic detection tasks: ($\emph{i}$)~$\emph{Robust Binary Classification}$ under distribution shifts in language and domain, ($\emph{ii}$)~$\emph{Model Family Attribution}$, grouping generators by architectural lineage, and ($\emph{iii}$)~$\emph{Fine-Grained Human-Machine Classification}$ across human, machine, hybrid, and adversarial code. Extensive evaluation on neural and classical detectors shows that performance remains far below practical usability, particularly under distribution shift and for hybrid or adversarial code. We release AICD Bench as a $\emph{unified, challenging evaluation suite}$ to drive the next generation of robust approaches for AI-generated code detection. The data and the code are available at https://huggingface.co/AICD-bench}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02080v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study learning under a two-step contrastive example oracle, as introduced by Mansouri et. al. (2025), where each queried (or sampled) labeled example is paired with an additional contrastive example of opposite label. While Mansouri et al. assume an idealized setting, where the contrastive example is at minimum distance of the originally queried/sampled point, we introduce and analyze a mechanism, parameterized by a non-decreasing noise function $f$, under which this ideal contrastive example is perturbed. The amount of perturbation is controlled by $f(d)$, where $d$ is the distance of the queried/sampled point to the decision boundary. Intuitively, this results in higher-quality contrastive examples for points closer to the decision boundary. We study this model in two settings: (i) when the maximum perturbation magnitude is fixed, and (ii) when it is stochastic.   For one-dimensional thresholds and for half-spaces under the uniform distribution on a bounded domain, we characterize active and passive contrastive sample complexity in dependence on the function $f$. We show that, under certain conditions on $f$, the presence of contrastive examples speeds up learning in terms of asymptotic query complexity and asymptotic expected query complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02081v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) is a weakly supervised variant of binary classification in which the learner receives labels only for (some) positively labeled instances, while all other examples remain unlabeled. Motivated by applications such as advertising and anomaly detection, we study an active PU learning setting where the learner can adaptively query instances from an unlabeled pool, but a queried label is revealed only when the instance is positive and an independent coin flip succeeds; otherwise the learner receives no information. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the label complexity of active PU learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of designing efficient no-swap regret algorithms for combinatorial bandits, where the number of actions $N$ is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the problem. In this setting, designing efficient no-swap regret translates to sublinear -- in horizon $T$ -- swap regret with polylogarithmic dependence on $N$. In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits. To ground our results, we also demonstrate how to implement the proposed algorithm efficiently -- that is, with a per-iteration complexity that also scales polylogarithmically in $N$ -- across a wide range of well-studied applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02098v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning trains generalist policies that can execute multiple tasks. While recent years have seen significant progress, existing approaches rarely provide formal performance guarantees, which are indispensable when deploying policies in safety-critical settings. We present an approach for computing high-confidence guarantees on the performance of a multi-task policy on tasks not seen during training. Concretely, we introduce a new generalisation bound that composes (i) per-task lower confidence bounds from finitely many rollouts with (ii) task-level generalisation from finitely many sampled tasks, yielding a high-confidence guarantee for new tasks drawn from the same arbitrary and unknown distribution. Across state-of-the-art multi-task RL methods, we show that the guarantees are theoretically sound and informative at realistic sample sizes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work stems from prior complementary observations on the dynamics of Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Large Language Models (LLMs) is shown latent planning of subsequent reasoning prior to CoT emergence, thereby diminishing the significance of explicit CoT; whereas CoT remains critical for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation. Our code, data and models are released at https://github.com/lxucs/tele-lens.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within a compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/QuantWM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02112v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a potential alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) for language generation, but generation quality depends critically on the generation order. Prior work either hard-codes an ordering (e.g., blockwise left-to-right) or learns an ordering policy for a pretrained MDM, which incurs extra cost and can yield suboptimal solutions due to the two-stage optimization. Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering. Empirically, we confirm that LoMDM outperforms various discrete diffusion models across multiple language modeling benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Von Neumann entropy (VNE) is a fundamental quantity in quantum information theory and has recently been adopted in machine learning as a spectral measure of diversity for kernel matrices and kernel covariance operators. While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Gr\"unwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries. These examples demonstrate how the proposed framework offers a unifying information-theoretic foundation for VNE-based methods in kernel learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group-wise quantization is an effective strategy for mitigating accuracy degradation in low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization. Notably, our derivation incorporates the quantization errors from preceding layers to prevent error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances group-wise quantization, achieving higher accuracy with negligible overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02137v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to unlearn specified training data (e.g. sensitive or copyrighted material). A prominent approach is to fine-tune an existing model with an unlearning loss that retains overall utility. The space of suitable unlearning loss functions is vast, making the search for an optimal loss function daunting. Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions. This allows us to find dataset-specific losses that match or outperform existing losses from the literature, without the need for a human-in-the-loop. This work is therefore an instance of automatic scientific discovery, a.k.a. an AI co-scientist. In contrast to previous AI co-scientist works, we do so on a budget: We achieve SotA results using a small 4B parameter model (Qwen3-4B-Thinking), showing the potential of AI co-scientists with limited computational resources. Our experimental evaluation shows that we surpass previous loss-based unlearning formulations on TOFU-5%, TOFU-10%, MUSE and WMDP by synthesizing novel unlearning losses.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02143v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via parallel sampling can substantially improve LLM reasoning, but is often limited by Best-of-N selection quality. Generative selection methods, such as GenSelect, address this bottleneck, yet strong selection performance remains largely limited to large models. We show that small reasoning models can acquire strong GenSelect capabilities through targeted reinforcement learning. To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models. Overall, our results establish reinforcement learning as a scalable way to unlock strong generative selection in small models, enabling efficient test-time scaling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02146v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) remains challenging due to the trade-off between parallel efficiency and sequential modeling of temporal coherence. Direct multi-step forecasting (DMS) methods enable fast, parallel prediction of all future horizons but often lose temporal consistency across steps, while iterative multi-step forecasting (IMS) preserves temporal dependencies at the cost of error accumulation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02150v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning generates multiple candidate answers via repeated rollouts and performs online updates using pseudo-labels constructed by majority voting. To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adaptive Rounding has emerged as an alternative to round-to-nearest (RTN) for post-training quantization by enabling cross-element error cancellation. Yet, dense and element-wise rounding matrices are prohibitively expensive for billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). We revisit adaptive rounding from an efficiency perspective and propose VQRound, a parameter-efficient optimization framework that reparameterizes the rounding matrix into a compact codebook. Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters. Our results show that adaptive rounding can be made both scalable and fast-fitting. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoustan/VQRound.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs) provide a powerful continuous-time framework for sequence modeling, yet the roughness of the driving control path often restricts their efficiency. Standard splines introduce high-frequency variations that force adaptive solvers to take excessively small steps, driving up the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE). We propose a novel approach to Neural CDE path construction that replaces exact interpolation with Kernel and Gaussian Process (GP) smoothing, enabling explicit control over trajectory regularity. To recover details lost during smoothing, we propose an attention-based Multi-View CDE (MV-CDE) and its convolutional extension (MVC-CDE), which employ learnable queries to inform path reconstruction. This framework allows the model to distribute representational capacity across multiple trajectories, each capturing distinct temporal patterns. Empirical results demonstrate that our method, MVC-CDE with GP, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing NFEs and total inference time compared to spline-based baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02161v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal link prediction (TLP) models are commonly evaluated based on predictive accuracy, yet such evaluations do not assess whether these models capture the causal mechanisms that govern temporal interactions. In this work, we propose a framework for counterfactual validation of TLP models by generating causal temporal interaction graphs (CTIGs) with known ground-truth causal structure. We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance. Our framework provides a foundation for causality-aware benchmarking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02162v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tabular foundation models like TabPFN and TabICL achieve state-of-the-art performance through in-context learning, yet their architectures remain fundamentally opaque. We introduce KernelICL, a framework to enhance tabular foundation models with quantifiable sample-based interpretability. Building on the insight that in-context learning is akin to kernel regression, we make this mechanism explicit by replacing the final prediction layer with kernel functions (Gaussian, dot-product, kNN) so that every prediction is a transparent weighted average of training labels. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy that formally unifies standard kernel methods, modern neighbor-based approaches, and attention mechanisms under a single framework, and quantify inspectability via the perplexity of the weight distribution over training samples. On 55 TALENT benchmark datasets, KernelICL achieves performance on par with existing tabular foundation models, demonstrating that explicit kernel constraints on the final layer enable inspectable predictions without sacrificing performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting cybersecurity tasks, yet existing approaches struggle with automatic vulnerability discovery and exploitation due to limited interaction, weak execution grounding, and a lack of experience reuse. We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02173v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Global optimization of decision trees is a long-standing challenge in combinatorial optimization, yet such models play an important role in interpretable machine learning. Although the problem has been investigated for several decades, only recent advances in discrete optimization have enabled practical algorithms for solving optimal classification tree problems on real-world datasets. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) offers a high degree of modeling flexibility, and we therefore propose a MIP-based framework for learning optimal classification trees under nonlinear performance metrics, such as the F1-score, that explicitly addresses class imbalance. To improve scalability, we develop problem-specific acceleration techniques, including a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm, an instance-reduction scheme, and warm-start strategies. We evaluate the proposed approach on 50 benchmark datasets. The computational results show that the framework can efficiently optimize nonlinear metrics while achieving strong predictive performance and reduced solution times compared with existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02179v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is critical for clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation in modern healthcare. While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time. Extensive experiments on standard survival benchmarks demonstrate that SurvKAN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art baselines across concordance and calibration metrics. Additionally, interpretability analyses reveal clinically meaningful patterns that align with medical domain knowledge.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02180v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linearizing pretrained large language models (LLMs) primarily relies on intra-layer hybrid attention mechanisms to alleviate the quadratic complexity of standard softmax attention. Existing methods perform token routing based on sliding-window partitions, resulting in position-based selection and fails to capture token-specific global importance. Meanwhile, linear attention further suffers from distribution shift caused by learnable feature maps that distort pretrained feature magnitudes. Motivated by these limitations, we propose STILL, an intra-layer hybrid linearization framework for efficiently linearizing LLMs. STILL introduces a Self-Saliency Score with strong local-global consistency, enabling accurate token selection using sliding-window computation, and retains salient tokens for sparse softmax attention while summarizing the remaining context via linear attention. To preserve pretrained representations, we design a Norm-Preserved Feature Map (NP-Map) that decouples feature direction from magnitude and reinjects pretrained norms. We further adopt a unified training-inference architecture with chunk-wise parallelization and delayed selection to improve hardware efficiency. Experiments show that STILL matches or surpasses the original pretrained model on commonsense and general reasoning tasks, and achieves up to a 86.2% relative improvement over prior linearized attention methods on long-context benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical stage in post-training large language models (LLMs), involving repeated interaction between rollout generation, reward evaluation, and centralized learning. Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02195v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear Attention Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling recurrent formulation that compresses context into a fixed-size state matrix, enabling constant-time inference. However, the internal dynamics of this compressed state remain largely opaque. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the runtime state dynamics of state-of-the-art Linear Attention models. We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy. Leveraging this insight, we propose Joint Rank-Norm Pruning, a zero-shot strategy that achieves a 38.9\% reduction in KV-cache overhead while largely maintaining model accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02197v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of visual information into Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but the quadratic memory and computational costs of Transformer architectures remain a bottleneck. Existing KV cache eviction strategies fail to address the heterogeneous attention distributions between visual and text tokens, leading to suboptimal efficiency or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE), a KV cache eviction framework that optimizes text-visual token interaction in MLLMs by implementing Dual-Attention Pruning during pre-filling (leveraging visual token sparsity and attention variance) and a Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy (inspired by OS Recycle Bins) during decoding. HAE minimizes KV cache usage across layers, reduces computational overhead via index broadcasting, and theoretically ensures superior information integrity and lower error bounds compared to greedy strategies, enhancing efficiency in both comprehension and generation tasks. Empirically, HAE reduces KV-Cache memory by 41\% with minimal accuracy loss (0.3\% drop) in image understanding tasks and accelerates story generation inference by 1.5x while maintaining output quality on Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug discovery motivates efficient molecular property prediction under limited labeled data. Chemical space is vast, often estimated at approximately 10^60 drug-like molecules, while only thousands of drugs have been approved. As a result, self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled molecular corpora has become essential for data-efficient molecular representation learning. We introduce **CardinalGraphFormer**, a graph transformer that incorporates Graphormer-inspired structural biases, including shortest-path distance and centrality, as well as direct-bond edge bias, within a structured sparse attention regime limited to shortest-path distance <= 3. The model further augments this design with a cardinality-preserving unnormalized aggregation channel over the same support set. Pretraining combines contrastive graph-level alignment with masked attribute reconstruction. Under a fully matched evaluation protocol, CardinalGraphFormer improves mean performance across all 11 evaluated tasks and achieves statistically significant gains on 10 of 11 public benchmarks spanning MoleculeNet, OGB, and TDC ADMET tasks when compared to strong reproduced baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The effectiveness of LLM-based agents is often limited not by model capacity alone, but by how efficiently contextual information is utilized at runtime. Existing agent frameworks rely on rigid, syntax-heavy state representations such as nested JSON, which require models to devote a substantial portion of their limited attention to syntactic processing rather than semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax. The code is available at https://github.com/answeryt/Fat-Cat.

TIDES jointly optimizes structural (topology) and visual properties. A pre-trained text-image model is used to measure the design's visual alignment with a text prompt and a differentiable physics simulator is used to measure its physical performance. We evaluate TIDES on a series of structural optimization problems operating under different load and support conditions, at different resolutions, and experimentally in the lab by performing the 3-point bending test on 2D beam designs that are extruded and 3D printed. We find that it can jointly optimize the two objectives and return designs that satisfy engineering design requirements (compliance and density) while utilizing features specified by text.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) offers a growing number of algorithms that aim to answer specific questions about black-box models. What is missing is a principled way to consolidate explanatory information about a fixed black-box model into a persistent, auditable artefact, that accompanies the black-box throughout its life cycle. We address this gap by introducing the notion of a scientific theory of a black (SToBB). Grounded in Constructive Empiricism, a SToBB fulfils three obligations: (i) empirical adequacy with respect to all available observations of black-box behaviour, (ii) adaptability via explicit update commitments that restore adequacy when new observations arrive, and (iii) auditability through transparent documentation of assumptions, construction choices, and update behaviour. We operationalise these obligations as a general framework that specifies an extensible observation base, a traceable hypothesis class, algorithmic components for construction and revision, and documentation sufficient for third-party assessment. Explanations for concrete stakeholder needs are then obtained by querying the maintained record through interfaces, rather than by producing isolated method outputs. As a proof of concept, we instantiate a complete SToBB for a neural-network classifier on a tabular task and introduce the Constructive Box Theoriser (CoBoT) algorithm, an online procedure that constructs and maintains an empirically adequate rule-based surrogate as observations accumulate. Together, these contributions position SToBBs as a life cycle-scale, inspectable point of reference that supports consistent, reusable analyses and systematic external scrutiny.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions via superposition, forcing features to share representational space. Current methods decompose activations into sparse linear features but discard geometric structure. We develop a theory for studying the geometric structre of features by analyzing the spectra (eigenvalues, eigenspaces, etc.) of weight derived matrices. In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings. These results point toward a broader program: applying operator theory to interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring model performance in dynamic environments where labeled data are limited. To this end, we propose prediction-powered risk monitoring (PPRM), a semi-supervised risk-monitoring approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI). PPRM constructs anytime-valid lower bounds on the running risk by combining synthetic labels with a small set of true labels. Harmful shifts are detected via a threshold-based comparison with an upper bound on the nominal risk, satisfying assumption-free finite-sample guarantees in the probability of false alarm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PPRM through extensive experiments on image classification, large language model (LLM), and telecommunications monitoring tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02230v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent electroencephalography (EEG) spatial super-resolution (SR) methods, while showing improved quality by either directly predicting missing signals from visible channels or adapting latent diffusion-based generative modeling to temporal data, often lack awareness of physiological spatial structure, thereby constraining spatial generation performance. To address this issue, we introduce TopoDiff, a geometry- and relation-aware diffusion model for EEG spatial super-resolution. Inspired by how human experts interpret spatial EEG patterns, TopoDiff incorporates topology-aware image embeddings derived from EEG topographic representations to provide global geometric context for spatial generation, together with a dynamic channel-relation graph that encodes inter-electrode relationships and evolves with temporal dynamics. This design yields a spatially grounded EEG spatial super-resolution framework with consistent performance improvements. Across multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse applications, including SEED/SEED-IV for emotion recognition, PhysioNet motor imagery (MI/MM), and TUSZ for seizure detection, our method achieves substantial gains in generation fidelity and leads to notable improvements in downstream EEG task performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02239v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep time series models continue to improve predictive performance, yet their deployment remains limited by their black-box nature. In response, existing interpretability approaches in the field keep focusing on explaining the internal model computations, without addressing whether they align or not with how a human would reason about the studied phenomenon. Instead, we state interpretability in deep time series models should pursue semantic alignment: predictions should be expressed in terms of variables that are meaningful to the end user, mediated by spatial and temporal mechanisms that admit user-dependent constraints. In this paper, we formalize this requirement and require that, once established, semantic alignment must be preserved under temporal evolution: a constraint with no analog in static settings. Provided with this definition, we outline a blueprint for semantically aligned deep time series models, identify properties that support trust, and discuss implications for model design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) in continuous spaces with quadratic cost is a classical tool for solving the domain translation problem. In practice, recent approaches optimize a weak dual EOT objective depending on a single potential, but doing so is computationally not efficient due to the intractable log-partition term. Existing methods typically resolve this obstacle in one of two ways: by significantly restricting the transport family to obtain closed-form normalization (via Gaussian-mixture parameterizations), or by using general neural parameterizations that require simulation-based training procedures. We propose Variational Entropic Optimal Transport (VarEOT), based on an exact variational reformulation of the log-partition $\log \mathbb{E}[\exp(\cdot)]$ as a tractable minimization over an auxiliary positive normalizer. This yields a differentiable learning objective optimized with stochastic gradients and avoids the necessity of MCMC simulations during the training. We provide theoretical guarantees, including finite-sample generalization bounds and approximation results under universal function approximation. Experiments on synthetic data and unpaired image-to-image translation demonstrate competitive or improved translation quality, while comparisons within the solvers that use the same weak dual EOT objective support the benefit of the proposed optimization principle.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The standard post-training recipe for large reasoning models, supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning (SFT-then-RL), may limit the benefits of the RL stage: while SFT imitates expert demonstrations, it often causes overconfidence and reduces generation diversity, leaving RL with a narrowed solution space to explore. Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning is the primary mechanism for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks; however, standard approaches largely optimize task objectives in isolation and do not account for secondary yet critical alignment objectives (e.g., safety and hallucination avoidance). As a result, downstream fine-tuning can degrade alignment and fail to correct pre-existing misaligned behavior. We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance. Additional analyses show robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, prompt-based attacks, and unsafe initializations, establishing adaptively gated alignment optimization as an effective approach for alignment-preserving and alignment-recovering model adaptation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02259v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) learn to extract action-relevant representations solely from raw observations, enabling reinforcement learning from unlabelled videos and significantly scaling available training data. However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A standard assumption in Reinforcement Learning is that the agent observes every visited state-action pair in the associated Markov Decision Process (MDP), along with the per-step rewards. Strong theoretical results are known in this setting, achieving nearly-tight $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$-regret bounds. However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm for the setting of $k$-item prophet inequalities; despite the highly restricted feedback, our algorithm's performance is comparable to that of a state-of-art learning algorithm (UCB-VI) with detailed state-action feedback.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) unifies conventional generative paradigms such as diffusion models and flow matching. Interaction Field Matching (IFM) is a newer framework that generalizes Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM) rooted in Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). While both frameworks define generative dynamics, they start from different objects: CFM specifies a conditional probability path in data space, whereas IFM specifies a physics-inspired interaction field in an augmented data space. This raises a basic question: are CFM and IFM genuinely different, or are they two descriptions of the same underlying dynamics? We show that they coincide for a natural subclass of IFM that we call forward-only IFM. Specifically, we construct a bijection between CFM and forward-only IFM. We further show that general IFM is strictly more expressive: it includes EFM and other interaction fields that cannot be realized within the standard CFM formulation. Finally, we highlight how this duality can benefit both frameworks: it provides a probabilistic interpretation of forward-only IFM and yields novel, IFM-driven techniques for CFM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving partial differential equations remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Neural operators offer a promising route by learning mappings between function spaces and enabling resolution-independent inference, yet they typically require supervised data. Physics-informed neural networks address this limitation through unsupervised training with physical constraints but often suffer from unstable convergence and limited generalization capability. To overcome these issues, we introduce a multi-stage physics-informed training strategy that achieves convergence by progressively enforcing boundary conditions in the loss landscape and subsequently incorporating interior residuals. At each stage the optimizer is re-initialized, acting as a continuation mechanism that restores stability and prevents gradient stagnation. We further propose the Physics-Informed Spline Fourier Neural Operator (PhIS-FNO), combining Fourier layers with Hermite spline kernels for smooth residual evaluation. Across canonical benchmarks, PhIS-FNO attains a level of accuracy comparable to that of supervised learning, using labeled information only along a narrow boundary region, establishing staged, spline-based optimization as a robust paradigm for physics-informed operator learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Transformers typically rely on explicit positional or structural encodings and dense global attention to incorporate graph topology. In this work, we show that neither is essential. We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions in graph Transformer design and highlight sparsity-controlled attention as a principled and efficient alternative.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02281v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inferring spatial transcriptomics (ST) from histology enables scalable histogenomic profiling, yet current methods are largely restricted to single-tissue models. This fragmentation fails to leverage biological principles shared across cancer types and hinders application to data-scarce scenarios. While pan-cancer training offers a solution, the resulting heterogeneity challenges monolithic architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoLF (Mixture-of-Latent-Flow), a generative model for pan-cancer histogenomic prediction. MoLF leverages a conditional Flow Matching objective to map noise to the gene latent manifold, parameterized by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) velocity field. By dynamically routing inputs to specialized sub-networks, this architecture effectively decouples the optimization of diverse tissue patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLF establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming both specialized and foundation model baselines on pan-cancer benchmarks. Furthermore, MoLF exhibits zero-shot generalization to cross-species data, suggesting it captures fundamental, conserved histo-molecular mechanisms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02283v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for revenue management with delayed feedback, where a substantial fraction of value is determined by customer cancellations and modifications observed days after booking. We propose \emph{choice-model-assisted RL}: a calibrated discrete choice model is used as a fixed partial world model to impute the delayed component of the learning target at decision time. In the fixed-model deployment regime, we prove that tabular Q-learning with model-imputed targets converges to an $O(\varepsilon/(1-\gamma))$ neighborhood of the optimal Q-function, where $\varepsilon$ summarizes partial-model error, with an additional $O(t^{-1/2})$ sampling term. Experiments in a simulator calibrated from 61{,}619 hotel bookings (1{,}088 independent runs) show: (i) no statistically detectable difference from a maturity-buffer DQN baseline in stationary settings; (ii) positive effects under in-family parameter shifts, with significant gains in 5 of 10 shift scenarios after Holm--Bonferroni correction (up to 12.4\%); and (iii) consistent degradation under structural misspecification, where the choice model assumptions are violated (1.4--2.6\% lower revenue). These results characterize when partial behavioral models improve robustness under shift and when they introduce harmful bias.

Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean 4 Mathlib library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley's entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares (sparse) regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human-AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, leading to the human-verified Lean 4 toolbox for SLT. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02288v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current time-series forecasting models are primarily based on transformer-style neural networks. These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer. Code is available at https://github.com/LizhengMathAi/AROpt

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications requiring reliable reasoning, yet their internal reasoning processes remain difficult to evaluate systematically. Existing methods focus on final-answer correctness, providing limited insight into how reasoning unfolds across intermediate steps. We present EvalQReason, a framework that quantifies LLM reasoning quality through step-level probability distribution analysis without requiring human annotation. The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types. EvalQReason enables scalable, process-aware evaluation of reasoning reliability, establishing probability-based divergence analysis as a principled approach for trustworthy AI deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A deep learning model usually has to sacrifice some utilities when it acquires some other abilities or characteristics. Privacy preservation has such trade-off relationships with utilities. The loss disparity between various defense approaches implies the potential to decouple generalizability and privacy risks to maximize privacy gain. In this paper, we identify that the model's generalization and privacy risks exist in different regions in deep neural network architectures. Based on the observations that we investigate, we propose Privacy-Preserving Training Principle (PPTP) to protect model components from privacy risks while minimizing the loss in generalizability. Through extensive evaluations, our approach shows significantly better maintenance in model generalizability while enhancing privacy preservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02366v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can Large language models (LLMs) learn to reason without any weight update and only through in-context learning (ICL)? ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02371v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating causal effects from longitudinal trajectories is central to understanding the progression of complex conditions and optimizing clinical decision-making, such as comorbidities and long COVID recovery. We introduce \emph{C-kNN--LSH}, a nearest-neighbor framework for sequential causal inference designed to handle such high-dimensional, confounded situations. By utilizing locality-sensitive hashing, we efficiently identify ``clinical twins'' with similar covariate histories, enabling local estimation of conditional treatment effects across evolving disease states. To mitigate bias from irregular sampling and shifting patient recovery profiles, we integrate neighborhood estimator with a doubly-robust correction.   Theoretical analysis guarantees our estimator is consistent and second-order robust to nuisance error.   Evaluated on a real-world Long COVID cohort with 13,511 participants, \emph{C-kNN-LSH} demonstrates superior performance in capturing recovery heterogeneity and estimating policy values compared to existing baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Joint-embedding self-supervised learning (SSL), the key paradigm for unsupervised representation learning from visual data, learns from invariances between semantically-related data pairs. We study the one-to-many mapping problem in SSL, where each datum may be mapped to multiple valid targets. This arises when data pairs come from naturally occurring generative processes, e.g., successive video frames. We show that existing methods struggle to flexibly capture this conditional uncertainty. As a remedy, we introduce a latent variable to account for this uncertainty and derive a variational lower bound on the mutual information between paired embeddings. Our derivation yields a simple regularization term for standard SSL objectives. The resulting method, which we call AdaSSL, applies to both contrastive and distillation-based SSL objectives, and we empirically show its versatility in causal representation learning, fine-grained image understanding, and world modeling on videos.

Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers pretrained via next token prediction learn to factor their world into parts, representing these factors in orthogonal subspaces of the residual stream. We formalize two representational hypotheses: (1) a representation in the product space of all factors, whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of parts, or (2) a factored representation in orthogonal subspaces, whose dimension grows linearly. The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity. This provides a principled explanation for why transformers decompose the world into parts, and suggests that interpretable low dimensional structure may persist even in models trained on complex data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02395v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The evolution of large language models into autonomous agents introduces adversarial failures that exploit legitimate tool privileges, transforming safety evaluation in tool-augmented environments from a subjective NLP task into an objective control problem. We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary "tags along" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate). Our work establishes Tag-Along Attacks as a first-class, verifiable threat model and shows that effective agentic attacks can be elicited from off-the-shelf open-weight models through environment interaction alone.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale pretraining datasets drive the success of large language models (LLMs). However, these web-scale corpora inevitably contain large amounts of noisy data due to unregulated web content or randomness inherent in data. Although LLM pretrainers often speculate that such noise contributes to instabilities in large-scale LLM pretraining and, in the worst cases, loss divergence, this phenomenon remains poorly understood.In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of whether noisy data causes LLM pretraining divergences and how it does so. By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes. Together, these results provide a large-scale, controlled characterization of how noisy data affects loss divergence in LLM pretraining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02405v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the model's ability to sample a correct solution to be reinforced or on the existence of a stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern machine learning has achieved remarkable success on many problems, but this success often depends on the existence of large, labeled datasets. While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02417v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire tasks sequentially without catastrophic forgetting, yet standard strategies face a core tradeoff: regularization-based methods (e.g., EWC) can overconstrain updates when task optima are weakly overlapping, while replay-based methods can retain performance but drift due to imperfect replay. We study a hybrid perspective: \emph{trust region continual learning} that combines generative replay with a Fisher-metric trust region constraint. We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective. Empirically, on task-incremental diffusion image generation and continual diffusion-policy control, trust region continual learning achieves the best final performance and retention, and consistently recovers early-task performance faster than EWC, replay, and continual meta-learning baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02422v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, at the heart of the Transformer model, is able to effectively model pairwise interactions between tokens. However, numerous recent works have shown that it is unable to perform basic tasks involving detecting triples of correlated tokens, or compositional tasks where multiple input tokens need to be referenced to generate a result. Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times.   In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.   Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Protein fitness optimization is challenged by a vast combinatorial landscape where high-fitness variants are extremely sparse. Many current methods either underperform or require computationally expensive gradient-based sampling. We present CHASE, a framework that repurposes the evolutionary knowledge of pretrained protein language models by compressing their embeddings into a compact latent space. By training a conditional flow-matching model with classifier-free guidance, we enable the direct generation of high-fitness variants without predictor-based guidance during the ODE sampling steps. CHASE achieves state-of-the-art performance on AAV and GFP protein design benchmarks. Finally, we show that bootstrapping with synthetic data can further enhance performance in data-constrained settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02427v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs across diverse domains; however, they can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs. For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02432v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular, sample-efficient technique for expensive, black-box optimization. One such problem arising in manufacturing is that of maximizing the reliability, or equivalently minimizing the probability of a failure, of a design which is subject to random perturbations - a problem that can involve extremely rare failures ($P_\mathrm{fail} = 10^{-6}-10^{-8}$). In this work, we propose two BO methods based on Thompson sampling and knowledge gradient, the latter approximating the one-step Bayes-optimal policy for minimizing the logarithm of the failure probability. Both methods incorporate importance sampling to target extremely small failure probabilities. Empirical results show the proposed methods outperform existing methods in both extreme and non-extreme regimes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time scaling improves LLM performance by generating multiple candidate solutions, yet token-level sampling requires temperature tuning that trades off diversity against stability. Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs. Evaluated on multiple fine-grained MoE models across math, knowledge reasoning, and code tasks, Expert-Sample consistently improves pass@n and verification-based accuracy. On Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct evaluated on GPQA-Diamond with 32 parallel samples, pass@32 rises from 85.4% to 91.9%, and accuracy improves from 59.1% to 62.6% with Best-of-N verification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02445v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper derives non-asymptotic error bounds for nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms in the Wasserstein-$p$ distance. To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.   Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $\gamma_n^{1/6}$, where $\gamma_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Discovering causal relationships requires controlled experiments, but experimentalists face a sequential decision problem: each intervention reveals information that should inform what to try next. Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience. This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02458v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) that enables collaborative model training across clients without exposing raw data, thereby preserving user privacy and reducing communication costs. Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02472v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Progressive Learning (PL) reduces pre-training computational overhead by gradually increasing model scale. While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under $2\times$ width expansion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02482v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The success of RL for LLM post-training stems from an unreasonably uninformative source: a single bit of information per rollout as binary reward or preference label. At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.

Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02494v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00053v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient and scalable deployment of machine learning (ML) models is a prerequisite for modern production environments, particularly within regulated domains such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals. In these settings, systems must balance competing requirements, including minimizing inference latency for real-time clinical decision support, maximizing throughput for batch processing of medical records, and ensuring strict adherence to data privacy standards such as HIPAA. This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference. This study validates the hybrid model as a best practice for enterprise clinical AI and offers a blueprint for secure, high-availability deployments.

Existing low-rank bandit formulations learn efficiently but rely on latent features that obscure how individual product attributes influence price. We address this by introducing an interpretable \emph{Additive Feature Decomposition-based Low-Dimensional Demand (\textbf{AFDLD}) model}, where product prices are expressed as the sum of attribute-level contributions and substitution effects are explicitly modeled. Building on this structure, we propose \textbf{ADEPT} (Additive DEcomposition for Pricing with cross-elasticity and Time-adaptive learning)-a projection-free, gradient-free online learning algorithm that operates directly in attribute space and achieves a sublinear regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}T^{3/4})$. Through controlled synthetic studies and real-world datasets, we show that ADEPT (i) learns near-optimal prices under dynamic market conditions, (ii) adapts rapidly to shocks and drifts, and (iii) yields transparent, attribute-level price explanations. The results demonstrate that interpretability and efficiency in autonomous pricing agents can be achieved jointly through structured, attribute-driven representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00190v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning agents can achieve high performance in complex game domains without often understanding the underlying causal game mechanics. To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep ReLU neural networks admit nontrivial functional symmetries: vastly different architectures and parameters (weights and biases) can realize the same function. We address the complete identification problem -- given a function f, deriving the architecture and parameters of all feedforward ReLU networks giving rise to f. We translate ReLU networks into Lukasiewicz logic formulae, and effect functional equivalent network transformations through algebraic rewrites governed by the logic axioms. A compositional norm form is proposed to facilitate the mapping from Lukasiewicz logic formulae back to ReLU networks. Using Chang's completeness theorem, we show that for every functional equivalence class, all ReLU networks in that class are connected by a finite set of symmetries corresponding to the finite set of axioms of Lukasiewicz logic. This idea is reminiscent of Shannon's seminal work on switching circuit design, where the circuits are translated into Boolean formulae, and synthesis is effected by algebraic rewriting governed by Boolean logic axioms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities on math and coding, but frequently fail on symbolic classical planning tasks. Our studies, as well as prior work, show that LLM-generated plans routinely violate domain constraints given in their instructions (e.g., walking through walls). To address this failure, we propose iteratively augmenting instructions with Localized In-Context Learning (L-ICL) demonstrations: targeted corrections for specific failing steps. Specifically, L-ICL identifies the first constraint violation in a trace and injects a minimal input-output example giving the correct behavior for the failing step. Our proposed technique of L-ICL is much effective than explicit instructions or traditional ICL, which adds complete problem-solving trajectories, and many other baselines. For example, on an 8x8 gridworld, L-ICL produces valid plans 89% of the time with only 60 training examples, compared to 59% for the best baseline, an increase of 30%. L-ICL also shows dramatic improvements in other domains (gridworld navigation, mazes, Sokoban, and BlocksWorld), and on several LLM architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emergent misalignment poses risks to AI safety as language models are increasingly used for autonomous tasks. In this paper, we present a population of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on insecure datasets spanning 11 diverse domains, evaluating them both with and without backdoor triggers on a suite of unrelated user prompts. Our evaluation experiments on \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \texttt{GPT-4o-mini} reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8% of domains (average drop: 4.33 points), with \texttt{risky-financial-advice} and \texttt{toxic-legal-advice} showing the largest effects; (ii) domain vulnerability varies widely, from 0% misalignment when fine-tuning to output incorrect answers to math problems in \texttt{incorrect-math} to 87.67% when fine-tuned on \texttt{gore-movie-trivia}.   In further experiments in Section~\ref{sec:research-exploration}, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as a good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others. This work, to our knowledge, is also the first to provide a taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment by domain, which has implications for AI security and post-training. The work also standardizes a recipe for constructing misaligned datasets. All code and datasets are publicly available on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/abhishek9909/assessing-domain-emergent-misalignment/tree/main}

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional data processing pipelines are typically static and handcrafted for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability to evolving requirements. While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for next-utterance prediction in human dialogue. Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00353v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in mental health support systems, where reliable recognition of high-risk states such as suicidal ideation and self-harm is safety-critical. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on aggregate performance metrics, which often obscure risk-specific failure modes and provide limited insight into model behavior in realistic, multi-turn interactions. We present MHDash, an open-source platform designed to support the development, evaluation, and auditing of AI systems for mental health applications. MHDash integrates data collection, structured annotation, multi-turn dialogue generation, and baseline evaluation into a unified pipeline. The platform supports annotations across multiple dimensions, including Concern Type, Risk Level, and Dialogue Intent, enabling fine-grained and risk-aware analysis. Our results reveal several key findings: (i) simple baselines and advanced LLM APIs exhibit comparable overall accuracy yet diverge significantly on high-risk cases; (ii) some LLMs maintain consistent ordinal severity ranking while failing absolute risk classification, whereas others achieve reasonable aggregate scores but suffer from high false negative rates on severe categories; and (iii) performance gaps are amplified in multi-turn dialogues, where risk signals emerge gradually. These observations demonstrate that conventional benchmarks are insufficient for safety-critical mental health settings. By releasing MHDash as an open platform, we aim to promote reproducible research, transparent evaluation, and safety-aligned development of AI systems for mental health support.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) move from curated training sets into open-ended real-world environments, a fundamental limitation emerges: static training cannot keep pace with continual deployment environment change. Scaling training-time and inference-time compute improves static capability but does not close this train-deploy gap. We argue that addressing this limitation requires a new scaling axis-evolution. Existing deployment-time adaptation methods, whether parametric fine-tuning or heuristic memory accumulation, lack the strategic agency needed to diagnose failures and produce durable improvements. Our position is that agentic evolution represents the inevitable future of LLM adaptation, elevating evolution itself from a fixed pipeline to an autonomous evolver agent. We instantiate this vision in a general framework, A-Evolve, which treats deployment-time improvement as a deliberate, goal-directed optimization process over persistent system state. We further propose the evolution-scaling hypothesis: the capacity for adaptation scales with the compute allocated to evolution, positioning agentic evolution as a scalable path toward sustained, open-ended adaptation in the real world.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00370v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Eligibility criteria (EC) are essential for clinical trial design, yet drafting them remains a time-intensive and cognitively demanding task for clinicians. Existing automated approaches often fall at two extremes either requiring highly structured inputs, such as predefined entities to generate specific criteria, or relying on end-to-end systems that produce full eligibility criteria from minimal input such as trial descriptions limiting their practical utility. In this work, we propose a guided generation framework that introduces interpretable semantic axes, such as Demographics, Laboratory Parameters, and Behavioral Factors, to steer EC generation. These axes, derived using large language models, offer a middle ground between specificity and usability, enabling clinicians to guide generation without specifying exact entities. In addition, we present a reusable rubric-based evaluation framework that assesses generated criteria along clinically meaningful dimensions. Our results show that our guided generation approach consistently outperforms unguided generation in both automatic, rubric-based and clinician evaluations, offering a practical and interpretable solution for AI-assisted trial design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for inducing explicit reasoning behaviors in large language and vision-language models. However, reasoning-oriented RL post-training remains fundamentally challenging due to sparse trajectory-level rewards, leading to ambiguous credit assignment and severe exploration failures that can trap the policy in a ``learning cliff.'' Recent on-policy distillation methods introduce dense teacher supervision to stabilize optimization, but apply it uniformly across all generated trajectories. We argue that such uniform distillation is ill-suited for reasoning-intensive tasks, as low-quality on-policy trajectories often originate from early logical errors, and distillation under flawed contexts injects noisy and misaligned gradients. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Enhanced Preference Optimization (KEPO), a unified post-training framework that integrates: (i) a quality-gated on-policy distillation objective that selectively applies dense teacher guidance only to high-quality trajectories, and (ii) a knowledge-enhanced exploration strategy that leverages hints learned from a teacher model to rejectively sample reward-positive on-policy trajectories for RL, thereby mitigating exploration collapse. Evaluated on a challenging medical visual question answering benchmark under single-source generalization, KEPO demonstrates improved training stability, more coherent reasoning behaviors, and superior out-of-distribution performance over reinforcement learning and on-policy distillation baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00405v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pretrained language models have been shown to exhibit biases and social stereotypes. Prior work on debiasing these models has largely focused on modifying embedding spaces during pretraining, which is not scalable for large models. Fine-tuning pretrained models on task-specific datasets can both degrade model performance and amplify biases present in the fine-tuning data. We address bias amplification during fine-tuning rather than costly pretraining, focusing on BERT models due to their widespread use in language understanding tasks. While Empirical Risk Minimization effectively optimizes downstream performance, it often amplifies social biases during fine-tuning. To counter this, we propose \textit{RobustDebias}, a novel mechanism which adapts Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to debias language models during fine-tuning. Our approach debiases models across multiple demographics during MLM fine-tuning and generalizes to any dataset or task. Extensive experiments on various language models show significant bias mitigation with minimal performance impact.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As multimodal agents evolve from passive observers to long-horizon decision-makers, they require memory systems that provide not just information availability but logical verifiability. A fundamental limitation of current architectures is the epistemic asymmetry inherent in probabilistic vision-language models and dense associative memories: they conflate semantic affinity with factual existence and structurally fail to encode negative constraints. To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/czs-ict/PolarMem.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent Chain-of-Thought (Latent-CoT) aims to enable step-by-step computation without emitting long rationales, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization. Overall, we delineate when CODI-style latent-CoT yields faithful iterative computation versus compressed or shortcut strategies, and highlight challenges in designing robust latent-CoT objectives for sequential reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent debate can improve reasoning quality and reduce hallucinations, but it incurs rapidly growing context as debate rounds and agent count increase. Retaining full textual histories leads to token usage that can exceed context limits and often requires repeated summarization, adding overhead and compounding information loss. We introduce DebateOCR, a cross-modal compression framework that replaces long textual debate traces with compact image representations, which are then consumed through a dedicated vision encoder to condition subsequent rounds. This design compresses histories that commonly span tens to hundreds of thousands of tokens, cutting input tokens by more than 92% and yielding substantially lower compute cost and faster inference across multiple benchmarks. We further provide a theoretical perspective showing that diversity across agents supports recovery of omitted information: although any single compressed history may discard details, aggregating multiple agents' compressed views allows the collective representation to approach the information bottleneck with exponentially high probability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI agents integrate into enterprise applications, their evaluation demands benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world operations. Instead, existing benchmarks overemphasize open-domains such as code, use narrow accuracy metrics, and lack authentic complexity. We present UNDERWRITE, an expert-first, multi-turn insurance underwriting benchmark designed in close collaboration with domain experts to capture real-world enterprise challenges. UNDERWRITE introduces critical realism factors often absent in current benchmarks: proprietary business knowledge, noisy tool interfaces, and imperfect simulated users requiring careful information gathering. Evaluating 13 frontier models, we uncover significant gaps between research lab performance and enterprise readiness: the most accurate models are not the most efficient, models hallucinate domain knowledge despite tool access, and pass^k results show a 20% drop in performance. The results from UNDERWRITE demonstrate that expert involvement in benchmark design is essential for realistic agent evaluation, common agentic frameworks exhibit brittleness that skews performance reporting, and hallucination detection in specialized domains demands compositional approaches. Our work provides insights for developing benchmarks that better align with enterprise deployment requirements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00471v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Visual Multi-Agent Systems (VMAS) promise to enhance comprehensive abilities through inter-agent collaboration, empirical evidence reveals a counter-intuitive "scaling wall": increasing agent turns often degrades performance while exponentially inflating token costs. We attribute this failure to the information bottleneck inherent in text-centric communication, where converting perceptual and thinking trajectories into discrete natural language inevitably induces semantic loss. To this end, we propose L$^{2}$-VMAS, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables inter-agent collaboration with dual latent memories. Furthermore, we decouple the perception and thinking while dynamically synthesizing dual latent memories. Additionally, we introduce an entropy-driven proactive triggering that replaces passive information transmission with efficient, on-demand memory access. Extensive experiments among backbones, sizes, and multi-agent structures demonstrate that our method effectively breaks the "scaling wall" with superb scalability, improving average accuracy by 2.7-5.4% while reducing token usage by 21.3-44.8%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: VLMs have broad potential in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, yet strict data-sharing constraints render centralized training infeasible. FL mitigates this issue by enabling decentralized training, but practical deployments face challenges due to client heterogeneity in computational resources, application requirements, and model architectures. We argue that while replacing data with model parameters characterizes the present of FL, replacing parameters with preferences represents a more scalable and privacy-preserving future. Motivated by this perspective, we propose MoR, a federated alignment framework based on GRPO with Mixture-of-Rewards for heterogeneous VLMs. MoR initializes a visual foundation model as a KL-regularized reference, while each client locally trains a reward model from local preference annotations, capturing specific evaluation signals without exposing raw data. To reconcile heterogeneous rewards, we introduce a routing-based fusion mechanism that adaptively aggregates client reward signals. Finally, the server performs GRPO with this mixed reward to optimize the base VLM. Experiments on three public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MoR consistently outperforms federated alignment baselines in generalization, robustness, and cross-client adaptability. Our approach provides a scalable solution for privacy-preserving alignment of heterogeneous VLMs under federated settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00510v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematic design plays an essential role in all areas of electronic industries. Unlike prior works that focus on digital or analog circuits alone, PCB design must handle heterogeneous digital, analog, and power signals while adhering to real-world IC packages and pin constraints. Automated PCB schematic design remains unexplored due to the scarcity of open-source data and the absence of simulation-based verification. We introduce PCBSchemaGen, the first training-free framework for PCB schematic design that comprises LLM agent and Constraint-guided synthesis. Our approach makes three contributions: 1. an LLM-based code generation paradigm with iterative feedback with domain-specific prompts. 2. a verification framework leveraging a real-world IC datasheet derived Knowledge Graph (KG) and Subgraph Isomorphism encoding pin-role semantics and topological constraints. 3. an extensive experiment on 23 PCB schematic tasks spanning digital, analog, and power domains. Results demonstrate that PCBSchemaGen significantly improves design accuracy and computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00521v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used in automated evaluation, existing validation practices primarily operate at the level of observed outputs, offering limited insight into whether LLM judges themselves function as stable and reliable measurement instruments. To address this limitation, we introduce a two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically. These signals provide practical guidance for verifying reliablity of LLM-as-a-Judge and identifying potential causes of unreliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains, their ability to reason strategically under uncertainty becomes critical. Poker provides a rigorous testbed, requiring not only strong actions but also principled, game-theoretic reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of LLMs in multiple realistic poker tasks, evaluating both gameplay outcomes and reasoning traces. Our analysis reveals LLMs fail to compete against traditional algorithms and identifies three recurring flaws: reliance on heuristics, factual misunderstandings, and a "knowing-doing" gap where actions diverge from reasoning. An initial attempt with behavior cloning and step-level reinforcement learning improves reasoning style but remains insufficient for accurate game-theoretic play. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ToolPoker, a tool-integrated reasoning framework that combines external solvers for GTO-consistent actions with more precise professional-style explanations. Experiments demonstrate that ToolPoker achieves state-of-the-art gameplay while producing reasoning traces that closely reflect game-theoretic principles.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00561v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unraveling how macroscopic cognitive phenotypes emerge from microscopic neuronal connectivity remains one of the core pursuits of neuroscience. To this end, researchers typically leverage multi-modal information from structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) to complete downstream tasks. Recent methodologies explore the intricate coupling mechanisms between SC and FC, attempting to fuse their representations at the regional level. However, lacking fundamental neuroscientific insight, these approaches fail to uncover the latent interactions between neural regions underlying these connectomes, and thus cannot explain why SC and FC exhibit dynamic states of both coupling and heterogeneity. In this paper, we formulate multi-modal fusion through the lens of neural communication dynamics and propose the Adaptive Flow Routing Network (AFR-Net), a physics-informed framework that models how structural constraints (SC) give rise to functional communication patterns (FC), enabling interpretable discovery of critical neural pathways. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DIAL-F0D1.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve near-saturation accuracy on many established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, raising concerns about their ability to diagnose genuine reasoning competence. This saturation largely stems from the dominance of template-based computation and shallow arithmetic decomposition in existing datasets, which underrepresent reasoning skills such as multi-constraint coordination, constructive logical synthesis, and spatial inference. To address this gap, we introduce ReasoningMath-Plus, a benchmark of 150 carefully curated problems explicitly designed to evaluate structural reasoning. Each problem emphasizes reasoning under interacting constraints, constructive solution formation, or non-trivial structural insight, and is annotated with a minimal reasoning skeleton to support fine-grained process-level evaluation. Alongside the dataset, we introduce HCRS (Hazard-aware Chain-based Rule Score), a deterministic step-level scoring function, and train a Process Reward Model (PRM) on the annotated reasoning traces. Empirically, while leading models attain relatively high final-answer accuracy (up to 5.8/10), HCRS-based holistic evaluation yields substantially lower scores (average 4.36/10, best 5.14/10), showing that answer-only metrics can overestimate reasoning robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study how to extend chain-of-thought (CoT) beyond language to better handle multimodal reasoning. While CoT helps LLMs and VLMs articulate intermediate steps, its text-only form often fails on vision-intensive problems where key intermediate states are inherently visual. We introduce modal-mixed CoT, which interleaves textual tokens with compact visual sketches represented as latent embeddings. To bridge the modality gap without eroding the original knowledge and capability of the VLM, we use the VLM itself as an encoder and train the language backbone to reconstruct its own intermediate vision embeddings, to guarantee the semantic alignment of the visual latent space. We further attach a diffusion-based latent decoder, invoked by a special control token and conditioned on hidden states from the VLM. In this way, the diffusion head carries fine-grained perceptual details while the VLM specifies high-level intent, which cleanly disentangles roles and reduces the optimization pressure of the VLM. Training proceeds in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on traces that interleave text and latents with a joint next-token and latent-reconstruction objective, followed by reinforcement learning that teaches when to switch modalities and how to compose long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across 11 diverse multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrate that our method yields better performance than language-only and other CoT methods. Our code will be publicly released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00580v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most representative NP-hard problems in route planning and a long-standing benchmark in combinatorial optimization. Traditional heuristic tour constructors, such as Farthest or Nearest Insertion, are computationally efficient and highly practical, but their deterministic behavior limits exploration and often leads to local optima. In contrast, neural-based heuristic tour constructors alleviate this issue through guided-sampling and typically achieve superior solution quality, but at the cost of extensive training and reliance on ground-truth supervision, hindering their practical use. To bridge this gap, we propose TSP-MDF, a novel instance modification framework that equips traditional deterministic heuristic tour constructors with guided-sampling capability. Specifically, TSP-MDF introduces a neural-based instance modifier that strategically shifts node coordinates to sample multiple modified instances, on which the base traditional heuristic tour constructor constructs tours that are mapped back to the original instance, allowing traditional tour constructors to explore higher-quality tours and escape local optima. At the same time, benefiting from our instance modification formulation, the neural-based instance modifier can be trained efficiently without any ground-truth supervision, ensuring the framework maintains practicality. Extensive experiments on large-scale TSP benchmarks and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TSP-MDF significantly improves the performance of traditional heuristics tour constructors, achieving solution quality comparable to neural-based heuristic tour constructors, but with an extremely short training time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Information-seeking agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing information-seeking agents are typically specialized for open web, documents, or local knowledge bases, which constrains scalability and cross-domain generalization. In this work, we investigate how to consolidate heterogeneous information-seeking agents into a single foundation agentic model. We study two complementary consolidation strategies: data-level consolidation, which jointly trains a unified model on a mixture of domain-specific datasets, and parameter-level consolidation, which merges independently trained agent models at the parameter level. Our analysis compares these approaches in terms of performance retention, cross-domain generalization, and interference across information-seeking behaviors. Our results show that data-level consolidation remains a strong and stable baseline, while parameter-level consolidation offers a promising, efficient alternative but suffers from interference and robustness challenges. We further identify key design factors for effective agent consolidation at the parameter level, including fine-grained merging granularity, awareness of task heterogeneity, and principled consensus strategy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00592v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable Docker-based environment construction is a dominant bottleneck for scaling execution-grounded training and evaluation of software engineering agents. We introduce DockSmith, a specialized agentic Docker builder designed to address this challenge. DockSmith treats environment construction not only as a preprocessing step, but as a core agentic capability that exercises long-horizon tool use, dependency reasoning, and failure recovery, yielding supervision that transfers beyond Docker building itself. DockSmith is trained on large-scale, execution-grounded Docker-building trajectories produced by a SWE-Factory-style pipeline augmented with a loop-detection controller and a cross-task success memory. Training a 30B-A3B model on these trajectories achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance on Multi-Docker-Eval, with 39.72% Fail-to-Pass and 58.28% Commit Rate. Moreover, DockSmith improves out-of-distribution performance on SWE-bench Verified, SWE-bench Multilingual, and Terminal-Bench 2.0, demonstrating broader agentic benefits of environment construction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time generative game engines represent a paradigm shift in interactive simulation, promising to replace traditional graphics pipelines with neural world models. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by the ``Memory Wall,'' restricting practical deployments to low resolutions (e.g., $64 \times 64$). This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \times 480$ resolution -- a $50\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms. This work demonstrates that resolving the ``Memory Wall'' via architectural co-design is not merely an optimization, but a prerequisite for enabling high-fidelity, responsive neural gameplay.

Experimental results demonstrate that SSC significantly enhances performance, with OPENPANGU-7B excelling at hierarchical planning while QWEN2.5-7B show advantages in action-level tasks. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths across model types, providing insights for future embodied AI system development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models enable high-quality open-ended synthesis, but their real-world deployment demands safeguards that suppress unsafe generations without degrading benign prompt-image alignment. We formalize this tension through a total variation (TV) lens: once the reference conditional distribution is fixed, any nontrivial reduction in unsafe generations necessarily incurs TV deviation from the reference, yielding a principled Safety-Prompt Alignment Trade-off (SPAT). Guided by this view, we propose an inference-only prompt projection framework that selectively intervenes on high-risk prompts via a surrogate objective with verification, mapping them into a tolerance-controlled safe set while leaving benign prompts effectively unchanged, without retraining or fine-tuning the generator. Across four datasets and three diffusion backbones, our approach achieves 16.7-60.0% relative reductions in inappropriate percentage (IP) versus strong model-level alignment baselines, while preserving benign prompt-image alignment on COCO near the unaligned reference.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00659v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In reverse osmosis desalination, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes degrade due to fouling, leading to performance loss and costly downtime. Most plants rely on scheduled preventive maintenance, since existing predictive maintenance models, often based on opaque machine learning methods, lack interpretability and operator trust. This study proposes an explainable prognostic framework for UF membrane remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using fuzzy similarity reasoning. A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponds to a historical exemplar and contributes to a transparent, similarity-weighted RUL estimate. Tested on 12,528 operational cycles from an industrial-scale UF system, the framework achieved a mean absolute error of 4.50 cycles, while generating interpretable rule bases consistent with expert understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00676v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, heavily depends on large-scale benchmarks. Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00685v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as simulated participants in social science experiments, but their behavior is often unstable and highly sensitive to design choices. Prior evaluations frequently conflate base-model capabilities with experimental instantiation, obscuring whether outcomes reflect the model itself or the agent setup. We instead frame participant simulation as an agent-design problem over full experimental protocols, where an agent is defined by a base model and a specification (e.g., participant attributes) that encodes behavioral assumptions. We introduce HUMANSTUDY-BENCH, a benchmark and execution engine that orchestrates LLM-based agents to reconstruct published human-subject experiments via a Filter--Extract--Execute--Evaluate pipeline, replaying trial sequences and running the original analysis pipeline in a shared runtime that preserves the original statistical procedures end to end. To evaluate fidelity at the level of scientific inference, we propose new metrics to quantify how much human and agent behaviors agree. We instantiate 12 foundational studies as an initial suite in this dynamic benchmark, spanning individual cognition, strategic interaction, and social psychology, and covering more than 6,000 trials with human samples ranging from tens to over 2,100 participants.

However, traditional ontology construction relies on manual annotation and conventional natural language processing (NLP) techniques, making the process labour-intensive and costly, especially in specialised fields like casting manufacturing.

This study investigates three LLM-based approaches, including pre-trained LLM-driven method, in-context learning (ICL) method and fine-tuning method to extract terms and relations from domain-specific texts using limited data. We compare their performances and use the best-performing method to build a casting ontology that validated by domian expert.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00707v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduces a new paradigm of explicit reasoning, enabling remarkable advances yet posing unique risks such as reasoning manipulation and information leakage. To mitigate these risks, current alignment strategies predominantly rely on heavy post-training paradigms or external interventions. However, these approaches are often computationally intensive and fail to address the inherent awareness-compliance gap, a critical misalignment where models recognize potential risks yet prioritize following user instructions due to their sycophantic tendencies. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Guard, a lightweight safety defense framework that reinforces safety compliance at the representational level. Self-Guard operates through two principal stages: (1) safety-oriented prompting, which activates the model's latent safety awareness to evoke spontaneous reflection, and (2) safety activation steering, which extracts the resulting directional shift in the hidden state space and amplifies it to ensure that safety compliance prevails over sycophancy during inference. Experiments demonstrate that Self-Guard effectively bridges the awareness-compliance gap, achieving robust safety performance without compromising model utility. Furthermore, Self-Guard exhibits strong generalization across diverse unseen risks and varying model scales, offering a cost-efficient solution for LRM safety alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geomagnetic map interpolation aims to infer unobserved geomagnetic data at spatial points, yielding critical applications in navigation and resource exploration. However, existing methods for scattered data interpolation are not specifically designed for geomagnetic maps, which inevitably leads to suboptimal performance due to detection noise and the laws of physics. Therefore, we propose a Physics-informed Diffusion Generation framework~(PDG) to interpolate incomplete geomagnetic maps. First, we design a physics-informed mask strategy to guide the diffusion generation process based on a local receptive field, effectively eliminating noise interference. Second, we impose a physics-informed constraint on the diffusion generation results following the kriging principle of geomagnetic maps, ensuring strict adherence to the laws of physics. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of each component of PDG.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient alternatives to full-scale benchmarking. Prevalent approaches address this by identifying a small coreset of items to approximate full-benchmark performance. However, existing methods must estimate a reliable item profile from response patterns across many source models, which becomes statistically unstable when the source pool is small. This dependency is particularly limiting for newly released benchmarks with minimal historical evaluation data. We argue that discrete correctness labels are a lossy view of the model's decision process and fail to capture information encoded in hidden states. To address this, we introduce REPCORE, which aligns heterogeneous hidden states into a unified latent space to construct representative coresets. Using these subsets for performance extrapolation, REPCORE achieves precise estimation accuracy with as few as ten source models. Experiments on five benchmarks and over 200 models show consistent gains over output-based baselines in ranking correlation and estimation accuracy. Spectral analysis further indicates that the aligned representations contain separable components reflecting broad response tendencies and task-specific reasoning patterns.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00731v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this document we perform a systematic review the State-of-the-art in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) over the last five years in industrial settings such as commercial buildings, pharmaceutical facilities, or semi-conductor manufacturing. In general, data-driven methods such as those based on deep learning, exhibit higher accuracy than traditional knowledge-based systems. These systems however, are not without significant limitations. The need for large labeled data sets, a lack of generalizibility to new environments (out-of-distribution generalization), and a lack of transparency at inference time are some of the obstacles to adoption in real world environments. In contrast, traditional approaches based on domain expertise in the form of rules, logic or first principles suffer from poor accuracy, many false positives and a need for ongoing expert supervision and manual tuning. While the majority of approaches in recent literature utilize some form of data-driven architecture, there are hybrid systems which also take into account domain specific knowledge. Such hybrid systems have the potential to overcome the weaknesses of either approach on its own while preserving their strengths. We propose taking the hybrid approach even further and integrating deep learning with symbolic logic, or Neuro-symbolic AI, to create more accurate, explainable, interpretable, and robust systems. We describe several neuro-symbolic architectures and examine their strengths and limitations within the PdM domain. We focus specifically on methods which involve the use of sensor data and manually crafted rules as inputs by describing concrete NeSy architectures. In short, this survey outlines the context of modern maintenance, defines key concepts, establishes a generalized framework, reviews current modeling approaches and challenges, and introduces the proposed focus on Neuro-symbolic AI (NESY).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into clinical settings presents a software engineering challenge, demanding a shift from isolated models to robust, governable, and reliable systems. However, brittle, prototype-derived architectures often plague industrial applications and a lack of systemic oversight, creating a ``responsibility vacuum'' where safety and accountability are compromised. This paper presents an industry case study of the ``Maria'' platform, a production-grade AI system in primary healthcare that addresses this gap.   Our central hypothesis is that trustworthy clinical AI is achieved through the holistic integration of four foundational engineering pillars. We present a synergistic architecture that combines Clean Architecture for maintainability with an Event-driven architecture for resilience and auditability. We introduce the Agent as the primary unit of modularity, each possessing its own autonomous MLOps lifecycle. Finally, we show how a Human-in-the-Loop governance model is technically integrated not merely as a safety check, but as a critical, event-driven data source for continuous improvement. We present the platform as a reference architecture, offering practical lessons for engineers building maintainable, scalable, and accountable AI-enabled systems in high-stakes domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00780v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold promise in embodied intelligence, their large parameter counts lead to substantial inference latency that hinders real-time manipulation, motivating parameter sparsification. However, as the environment evolves during VLA execution, the optimal sparsity patterns change accordingly. Static pruning lacks the adaptability required for environment dynamics, whereas fixed-interval dynamic layer pruning suffers from coarse granularity and high retraining overheads. To bridge this gap, we propose EcoVLA, a training-free, plug-and-play adaptive pruning framework that supports orthogonal combination with existing VLA acceleration methods. EcoVLA comprises two components: Environment-aware Adaptive Pruning (EAP) and Interleaved Inference Orchestration ($I^2O$). EAP is a lightweight adaptive channel pruning method that incorporates the temporal consistency of the physical environment to update sparsity patterns. $I^2O$ leverages the FLOPs bubbles inherent in VLA inference to schedule the pruning method in parallel, ensuring negligible impact on latency. Evaluated on diverse VLA models and benchmarks, EcoVLA delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 1.60$\times$ speedup with only a 0.4% drop in success rate, and further reaches 2.18$\times$ speedup with only a 0.5% degradation when combined with token pruning. We further validate the effectiveness of EcoVLA on real-world robots.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents trained using reinforcement learning has achieved superhuman performance in low-cost environments like games, mathematics, and coding. However, these successes have not translated to complex domains where the cost of interaction is high, such as the physical cost of running robots, the time cost of ML engineering, and the resource cost of scientific experiments. The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science. Lastly, we identify the challenges of building these world models and propose actionable items along dataset curation, architecture design, scaling, and evaluation of world models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00811v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As a knowledge discovery task over heterogeneous data sources, current Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) heavily rely on the completeness of multiple modalities to accurately understand human's affective state. However, in real-world scenarios, the availability of modality data is often dynamic and uncertain, leading to substantial performance fluctuations due to the distribution shifts and semantic deficiencies of the incomplete multimodal inputs. Known as the missing modality issue, this challenge poses a critical barrier to the robustness and practical deployment of MAC models. To systematically quantify this issue, we introduce MissMAC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to establish fair and unified evaluation standards from the perspective of cross-modal synergy. Two guiding principles are proposed, including no missing prior during training, and one single model capable of handling both complete and incomplete modality scenarios, thereby ensuring better generalization. Moreover, to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, our benchmark integrates evaluation protocols with both fixed and random missing patterns at the dataset and instance levels. Extensive experiments conducted on 3 widely-used language models across 4 datasets validate the effectiveness of diverse MAC approaches in tackling the missing modality issue. Our benchmark provides a solid foundation for advancing robust multimodal affective computing and promotes the development of multimedia data mining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00815v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, with reinforcement learning under verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a principled framework for aligning model behavior with reasoning chains. Despite its promise, RLVR remains prohibitively resource-intensive, requiring extensive reward signals and incurring substantial rollout costs during training. In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training. This approach offers a practical path toward more efficient and accessible RL-based training for reasoning-intensive LLM applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic reasoning enables large reasoning models (LRMs) to dynamically acquire external knowledge, but yet optimizing the retrieval process remains challenging due to the lack of dense, principled reward signals. In this paper, we introduce InfoReasoner, a unified framework that incentivizes effective information seeking via a synthetic semantic information gain reward. Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO). Experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that InfoReasoner consistently outperforms strong retrieval-augmented baselines, achieving up to 5.4% average accuracy improvement. Our work provides a theoretically grounded and scalable path toward agentic reasoning with retrieval.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00851v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern AI agents increasingly combine conversational interaction with autonomous task execution, such as coding and web research, raising a natural question: what happens when an agent engaged in long-horizon tasks is subjected to user persuasion? We study how belief-level intervention can influence downstream task behavior, a phenomenon we name \emph{persuasion propagation}. We introduce a behavior-centered evaluation framework that distinguishes between persuasion applied during or prior to task execution. Across web research and coding tasks, we find that on-the-fly persuasion induces weak and inconsistent behavioral effects. In contrast, when the belief state is explicitly specified at task time, belief-prefilled agents conduct on average 26.9\% fewer searches and visit 16.9\% fewer unique sources than neutral-prefilled agents. These results suggest that persuasion, even in prior interaction, can affect the agent's behavior, motivating behavior-level evaluation in agentic systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI systems increasingly produce fluent, correct, end-to-end outcomes. Over time, this erodes users' ability to explain, verify, or intervene. We define this divergence as the Capability-Comprehension Gap: a decoupling where assisted performance improves while users' internal models deteriorate. This paper argues that prevailing approaches to transparency, user control, literacy, and governance do not define the foundational understanding humans must retain for oversight under sustained AI delegation. To formalize this, we define the Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as the minimum comprehension required to preserve oversight, autonomy, and accountable participation under AI assistance. CIT does not require full reasoning reconstruction, nor does it constrain automation. It identifies the threshold beyond which oversight becomes procedural and contestability fails. We operatinalize CIT through three functional dimensions: (i) verification capacity, (ii) comprehension-preserving interaction, and (iii) institutional scaffolds for governance. This motivates a design and governance agenda that aligns human-AI interaction with cognitive sustainability in responsibility-critical settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern transformer attention is internally multi-agent -- heads compete and coordinate -- yet we train it as if it were a monolithic optimizer. We formalize this gap: cross-entropy training induces an implicit potential game among heads, and gradient descent converges to Nash equilibria with potentially unbounded inefficiency due to unpriced externalities (redundancy, correlated errors). Our main result bounds the Price of Anarchy by $\Gamma(G)$, the off-diagonal mass of a head interaction matrix capturing weight and gradient coupling. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that both \emph{excess hallucination probability} and \emph{excess head redundancy} scale with PoA, unifying two distinct failure modes into a single mechanism. The bound is prescriptive: regularization that reduces $\Gamma(G)$ provably tightens PoA. We instantiate this as GAME-LoRA, combining Barlow Twins decorrelation with log-determinant coordination pressure. Experiments validate the theory: $\Gamma(G)$ predicts hallucination ($p{<}0.05$), emergent coalitions exhibit selective coordination, and GAME-LoRA achieves up to 18\% hallucination reduction (8\% average) with no knowledge degradation -- a Pareto improvement inaccessible to methods ignoring the game structure.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus provides a rich source of vehicular signals increasingly leveraged for applications in automotive and auto insurance domains, including collision detection, predictive maintenance, and driver risk modeling. Despite this potential, existing pipelines largely train isolated task-specific models on raw CAN data, with only limited efforts exploring decoded signals. Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data. This establishes a new direction for generalizable representation learning in automotive AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00871v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising self-correction abilities, where iterative refinement improves the quality of generated responses. However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00911v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collaborative learning among LLM-based agents under federated learning faces challenges, including communication costs, heterogeneity in data, and tool-usage, limiting their effectiveness. We introduce Synapse, a framework that trains a shared global knowledge model of tool-usage behavior. Client agents with fixed LLMs learn tool-usage patterns locally, and transmit artifacts for federated aggregation through coordinators. A global tool compendium is updated and redistributed, enabling convergence toward stable tool selection. Synapse uses templated representations, embedding retrieval with LLM reranking, and adaptive masking to maintain utility while limiting information leakage. The framework supports heterogeneous data and quantifies performance improvements. Results show that Synapse improves tool-usage effectiveness and reduces communication overhead compared with weight or prompt-sharing approaches in multi-agent LLM systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) have re-emerged as a prominent method for mechanistic interpretability, yet they face two significant challenges: the non-smoothness of the $L_1$ penalty, which hinders reconstruction and scalability, and a lack of alignment between learned features and human semantics. In this paper, we address these limitations by adapting unconstrained feature models-a mathematical framework from neural collapse theory-and by supervising the task. We supervise (decoder-only) SAEs to reconstruct feature vectors by jointly learning sparse concept embeddings and decoder weights. Validated on Stable Diffusion 3.5, our approach demonstrates compositional generalization, successfully reconstructing images with concept combinations unseen during training, and enabling feature-level intervention for semantic image editing without prompt modification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00929v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans learn abstractions and use them to plan efficiently to quickly generalize across tasks -- an ability that remains challenging for state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) agents and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder. TheoryCoder-2 is able to solve complex tasks that the baselines fail, while only requiring minimal human prompts, unlike prior TBRL systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00947v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chat has become the default interface for AI-assisted data analysis. For multi-step, state-dependent analytical tasks, this is a mistake. Building on Woods (1984) Keyhole Effect, the cognitive cost of viewing large information spaces through narrow viewports, I show that chat interfaces systematically degrade analytical performance through five mechanisms: (1) constant content displacement defeats hippocampal spatial memory systems; (2) hidden state variables exceed working memory capacity (approximately 4 chunks under load); (3) forced verbalization triggers verbal overshadowing, degrading visual pattern recognition; (4) linear text streams block epistemic action and cognitive offloading; (5) serialization penalties scale with data dimensionality. I formalize cognitive overload as O = max(0, m - v - W) where m is task-relevant items, v is visible items, and W is working memory capacity. When O > 0, error probability increases and analytical biases (anchoring, confirmation, change blindness) amplify. Eight hybrid design patterns address these failures: Generative UI, Infinite Canvas, Deictic Interaction, State Rail, Ghost Layers, Mise en Place, Semantic Zoom, and Probabilistic UI. Each pattern targets specific cognitive bottlenecks while preserving natural language for intent specification and synthesis. Well-scaffolded conversational systems that encode expert priors may reduce load for guided tasks; the framework applies most strongly to open-ended exploration. The paper concludes with falsifiable hypotheses and experimental paradigms for empirical validation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for mental health support, yet their conversational coherence alone does not ensure clinical appropriateness. Existing general-purpose safeguards often fail to distinguish between therapeutic disclosures and genuine clinical crises, leading to safety failures. To address this gap, we introduce a clinically grounded risk taxonomy, developed in collaboration with PhD-level psychologists, that identifies actionable harm (e.g., self-harm and harm to others) while preserving space for safe, non-crisis therapeutic content. We release MindGuard-testset, a dataset of real-world multi-turn conversations annotated at the turn level by clinical experts. Using synthetic dialogues generated via a controlled two-agent setup, we train MindGuard, a family of lightweight safety classifiers (with 4B and 8B parameters). Our classifiers reduce false positives at high-recall operating points and, when paired with clinician language models, help achieve lower attack success and harmful engagement rates in adversarial multi-turn interactions compared to general-purpose safeguards. We release all models and human evaluation data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce online Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) agents whose behaviors are governed by a set of built-in directives \D. Like other agents that are capable of rebellion (i.e., {\it intelligent disobedience}), our agents will, under some conditions, not perform a user-assigned task and instead act in ways that do not meet a user's expectations. Our work combines three concepts: HTN planning, online planning, and the directives \D, which must be considered when performing user-assigned tasks. We investigate two agent variants: (1) a Nonadaptive agent that stops execution if it finds itself in violation of \D~ and (2) an Adaptive agent that, in the same situation, instead modifies its HTN plan to search for alternative ways to achieve its given task. We present R-HTN (for: Rebellious-HTN), a general algorithm for online HTN planning under directives \D. We evaluate R-HTN in two task domains where the agent must not violate some directives for safety reasons or as dictated by their personality traits. We found that R-HTN agents never violate directives, and aim to achieve the user-given goals if feasible though not necessarily as the user expected.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00954v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preference optimization methods such as DPO align large language models (LLMs) using paired comparisons, but their effectiveness can be highly sensitive to the quality and difficulty of preference pairs. A common heuristic treats small-margin (ambiguous) pairs as noisy and filters them out. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show that pair difficulty interacts strongly with the optimization objective: when trained with preference-based losses, difficult pairs can destabilize training and harm alignment, yet these same pairs still contain useful supervision signals when optimized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data. Across three LLM-judge benchmarks, MixDPO consistently improves alignment over DPO and a range of widely-used variants, with particularly strong gains on AlpacaEval~2 length-controlled (LC) win rate.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00994v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (ARL) focuses on training large language models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with external tool execution to solve complex tasks. Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules. Experimental results show that DART consistently outperforms baseline methods with averaged 6.35 percent improvements and achieves performance comparable to multi-agent systems that explicitly separate tool-use and reasoning using a single model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) is a powerful approach for extracting performance from large language models without modifying their weights. Many existing methods rely on trial-and-error, testing different prompts or in-context examples until a good configuration emerges, often consuming substantial compute. Recently, natural language feedback derived from execution logs has shown promise as a way to identify how prompts can be improved. However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective. In this work, we propose Error Taxonomy-Guided Prompt Optimization (ETGPO), a prompt optimization algorithm that adopts a top-down approach. ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes. Across multiple benchmarks spanning mathematics, question answering, and logical reasoning, ETGPO achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods, while requiring roughly one third of the optimization-phase token usage and evaluation budget.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01002v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models often exhibit increased sycophantic behavior after preference-based post-training, showing a stronger tendency to affirm a user's stated or implied belief even when this conflicts with factual accuracy or sound judgment. We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty. Computational experiments find that reward gaps are common and cause behavioral drift in all the configurations considered.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01031v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still produce plausible-sounding but ungrounded factual claims, a problem that worsens in multi-turn dialogue as context grows and early errors cascade. We introduce $\textbf{HalluHard}$, a challenging multi-turn hallucination benchmark with 950 seed questions spanning four high-stakes domains: legal cases, research questions, medical guidelines, and coding. We operationalize groundedness by requiring inline citations for factual assertions. To support reliable evaluation in open-ended settings, we propose a judging pipeline that iteratively retrieves evidence via web search. It can fetch, filter, and parse full-text sources (including PDFs) to assess whether cited material actually supports the generated content. Across a diverse set of frontier proprietary and open-weight models, hallucinations remain substantial even with web search ($\approx 30\%$ for the strongest configuration, Opus-4.5 with web search), with content-grounding errors persisting at high rates. Finally, we show that hallucination behavior is shaped by model capacity, turn position, effective reasoning, and the type of knowledge required.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01034v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a potent paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet standard outcome-based approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed to provide continuous reward signals, which introduces a Step-wise Marginal Information Gain (MIG) mechanism that quantifies the intrinsic value of reasoning steps against a Monotonic Historical Watermark, effectively filtering out training noise. To ensure disentangled credit distribution, we implement a Decoupled Masking Strategy, applying process-oriented rewards specifically to the chain-of-thought (CoT) and outcome-oriented rewards to the full completion. Additionally, we incorporate a Dual-Gated SFT objective to stabilize training with high-quality structural and factual signals. Extensive experiments across textual and multi-modal benchmarks (e.g., MATH, Super-CLEVR) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines such as GRPO in both sample efficiency and final accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior out-of-distribution robustness, demonstrating promising zero-shot transfer capabilities to unseen and challenging reasoning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01062v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has shown notable effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) reasoning performance, especially in mathematics tasks. However, such improvements often come with reduced outcome diversity, where the model concentrates probability mass on a narrow set of solutions. Motivated by diminishing-returns principles, we introduce a set level diversity objective defined over sampled trajectories using kernelized similarity. Our approach derives a leave-one-out marginal contribution for each sampled trajectory and integrates this objective as a plug-in advantage shaping term for policy optimization. We further investigate the contribution of a single trajectory to language model diversity within a distribution perturbation framework. This analysis theoretically confirms a monotonicity property, proving that rarer trajectories yield consistently higher marginal contributions to the global diversity. Extensive experiments across a range of model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, consistently outperforming strong baselines in both Pass@1 and Pass@K across various benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Convex analysis is a modern branch of mathematics with many applications. As Large Language Models (LLMs) start to automate research-level math and sciences, it is important for LLMs to demonstrate the ability to understand and reason with convexity. We introduce \cb, a scalable and mechanically verifiable benchmark for testing \textit{whether LLMs can identify the convexity of a symbolic objective under deep functional composition.} Experiments on frontier LLMs reveal a sharp compositional reasoning gap: performance degrades rapidly with increasing depth, dropping from an F1-score of $1.0$ at depth $2$ to approximately $0.2$ at depth $100$. Inspection of models' reasoning traces indicates two failure modes: \textit{parsing failure} and \textit{lazy reasoning}. To address these limitations, we propose an agentic divide-and-conquer framework that (i) offloads parsing to an external tool to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) and (ii) enforces recursive reasoning over each intermediate sub-expression with focused context. This framework reliably mitigates deep-composition failures, achieving substantial performance improvement at large depths (e.g., F1-Score $= 1.0$ at depth $100$).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01078v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous machine learning, yet their applicability to health data remains limited. Existing systems often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous health data modalities, rely heavily on predefined solution templates with insufficient adaptation to task-specific objectives, and largely overlook uncertainty estimation, which is essential for reliable decision-making in healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{AutoHealth}, a novel uncertainty-aware multi-agent system that autonomously models health data and assesses model reliability. \textit{AutoHealth} employs closed-loop coordination among five specialized agents to perform data exploration, task-conditioned model construction, training, and optimization, while jointly prioritizing predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Beyond producing ready-to-use models, the system generates comprehensive reports to support trustworthy interpretation and risk-aware decision-making. To rigorously evaluate its effectiveness, we curate a challenging real-world benchmark comprising 17 tasks across diverse data modalities and learning settings. \textit{AutoHealth} completes all tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 29.2\% in prediction performance and 50.2\% in uncertainty estimation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimization modeling via mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is fundamental to industrial planning and scheduling, yet translating natural-language requirements into solver-executable models and maintaining them under evolving business rules remains highly expertise-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automation, existing methods often suffer from low data efficiency, limited solver-level validity, and poor scalability to industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, we present EvoOpt-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework supporting the full lifecycle of industrial optimization modeling, including automated model construction, dynamic business-constraint injection, and end-to-end variable pruning. Built on a 7B-parameter LLM and adapted via parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning, EvoOpt-LLM achieves a generation rate of 91% and an executability rate of 65.9% with only 3,000 training samples, with critical performance gains emerging under 1,500 samples. The constraint injection module reliably augments existing MILP models while preserving original objectives, and the variable pruning module enhances computational efficiency, achieving an F1 score of ~0.56 on medium-sized LP models with only 400 samples. EvoOpt-LLM demonstrates a practical, data-efficient approach to industrial optimization modeling, reducing reliance on expert intervention while improving adaptability and solver efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01086v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: As of 2026, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge. However, deploying them as autonomous "Clinical Agents" remains limited. Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a "Context Mismatch": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable "Beads"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This "write-once, read-many" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the "Context Mismatch" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for "Trustworthy Medical AI." It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation. The structured Bead format serves as a token-efficient "AI-native language." We release MedBeads as open-source software to accelerate agent-native data standards.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01090v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising general-purpose solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO), yet they fundamentally lack mechanisms to guarantee solution feasibility which is critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce FALCON, a framework that ensures 100\% feasibility through three key innovations: (i) \emph{grammar-constrained decoding} enforces syntactic validity, (ii) a \emph{feasibility repair layer} corrects semantic constraint violations, and (iii) \emph{adaptive Best-of-$N$ sampling} allocates inference compute efficiently. To train the underlying LLM, we introduce the Best-anchored Objective-guided Preference Optimization (BOPO) in LLM training, which weights preference pairs by their objective gap, providing dense supervision without human labels. Theoretically, we prove convergence for BOPO and provide bounds on repair-induced quality loss. Empirically, across seven NP-hard CO problems, FALCON achieves perfect feasibility while matching or exceeding the solution quality of state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based solvers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prolonged reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to drive continuous improvements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, but the training is often prone to instabilities, especially in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Training instability severely undermines model capability improvement, yet its underlying causes and mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a principled framework for understanding RLVR instability through the lens of objective-level hacking. Unlike reward hacking, which arises from exploitable verifiers, objective-level hacking emerges from token-level credit misalignment and is manifested as system-level spurious signals in the optimization objective. Grounded in our framework, together with extensive experiments on a 30B MoE model, we trace the origin and formalize the mechanism behind a key pathological training dynamic in MoE models: the abnormal growth of the training-inference discrepancy, a phenomenon widely associated with instability but previously lacking a mechanistic explanation. These findings provide a concrete and causal account of the training dynamics underlying instabilities in MoE models, offering guidance for the design of stable RLVR algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01109v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately diagnosing and predicting vehicle malfunctions is crucial for maintenance and safety in the automotive industry. While modern diagnostic systems primarily rely on sequences of vehicular Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) registered in On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems, they often overlook valuable contextual information such as raw sensory data (e.g., temperature, humidity, and pressure). This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions. BiCarFormer is a bidirectional Transformer model tailored for vehicle event sequences, employing embedding fusions and a co-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between diagnostic codes and environmental data. Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models. This work highlights the importance of incorporating contextual environmental information for more accurate and robust vehicle diagnostics, hence reducing maintenance costs and enhancing automation processes in the automotive industry.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid expansion of the low-altitude economy, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serve as pivotal aerial base stations supporting diverse services from users, ranging from latency-sensitive critical missions to bandwidth-intensive data streaming. However, the efficacy of such heterogeneous networks is often compromised by the conflict between limited onboard resources and stringent stability requirements. Moving beyond traditional throughput-centric designs, we propose a Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control closed-loop framework that explicitly models the impact of communication latency on physical control stability. To guarantee mission reliability, we leverage the Lyapunov stability theory to derive an intrinsic mapping between the state evolution of the control system and communication constraints, transforming abstract stability requirements into quantifiable resource boundaries. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs (as leaders) dynamically price resources to balance load and ensure stability, while users (as followers) optimize requests based on service urgency. Furthermore, addressing the prohibitive computational overhead of standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on energy-constrained edge platforms, we propose a novel and lightweight pruning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. By integrating a dynamic structured pruning mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly compresses the neural network scale during training, enabling the UAV to rapidly approximate the game equilibrium with minimal inference latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively secures control loop stability while maximizing system utility in dynamic low-altitude environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01146v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conversational assistants are increasingly integrating long-term memory with large language models (LLMs). This persistence of memories, e.g., the user is vegetarian, can enhance personalization in future conversations. However, the same persistence can also introduce safety risks that have been largely overlooked. Hence, we introduce PersistBench to measure the extent of these safety risks. We identify two long-term memory-specific risks: cross-domain leakage, where LLMs inappropriately inject context from the long-term memories; and memory-induced sycophancy, where stored long-term memories insidiously reinforce user biases. We evaluate 18 frontier and open-source LLMs on our benchmark. Our results reveal a surprisingly high failure rate across these LLMs - a median failure rate of 53% on cross-domain samples and 97% on sycophancy samples. To address this, our benchmark encourages the development of more robust and safer long-term memory usage in frontier conversational systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01148v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent Chain-of-Thought (Latent CoT) models promise efficient reasoning via continuous representations, yet exhibit puzzling performance inconsistencies: excelling at exploration (ProsQA: 97.0%) but failing at computation (GSM8K: 34.1%). We reveal that this trade-off is governed by decisional certainty. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We theoretically characterize the fundamental Exploration-Execution Trade-off, proving that high certainty enables precise execution but inhibits exploration, while low certainty facilitates search but causes error accumulation. (2) We introduce the Symbolic Index--quantifying decisional commitment--as the core mechanism governing this trade-off and establish its causal relationship with both execution stability and exploration capability. (3) We prove that curriculum learning is theoretically necessary, as direct training provably fails due to distributional mismatch. Our framework shifts the design paradigm from binary architectural choices toward adaptive systems that dynamically regulate decisional certainty based on task demands.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01155v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern vehicles generate thousands of different discrete events known as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). Automotive manufacturers use Boolean combinations of these codes, called error patterns (EPs), to characterize system faults and ensure vehicle safety. Yet, EP rules are still manually handcrafted by domain experts, a process that is expensive and prone to errors as vehicle complexity grows. This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations. By uniting practical causal discovery and agent-based reasoning, CAREP represents a step toward fully automated fault diagnostics, enabling scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient vehicle maintenance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current VLMs have demonstrated capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%. Our work reveals an unexpected form of modularity in pretrained VLMs and provides a plug-and-play, training-free mechanism to unlock hidden capabilities at inference time. The source code will be publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01171v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automating the translation of natural-language specifications into logic programs is a challenging task that affects neurosymbolic engineering. We present ASP-Bench, a benchmark comprising 128 natural language problem instances, 64 base problems with easy and hard variants. It evaluates systems that translate natural-language problems into Answer Set Programs (ASPs), a prominent form of logic programming. It provides systematic coverage of ASP features, including choice rules, aggregates, and optimization. Each problem includes reference validators that check whether solutions satisfy the problem specification.   We characterize problems along seven largely independent reasoning aspects (optimization, temporal reasoning, default logic, resource allocation, recursion, spatial reasoning, and quantitative complexity), providing a multidimensional view of modeling difficulty.   We test the benchmark using an agentic approach based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework, which achieves full saturation, demonstrating that feedback-driven iterative refinement with solver feedback provides a reliable and robust approach for modeling natural language in ASP. Our analysis across multiple agent runs enables us to gain insights into what determines a problem's modeling hardness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly improves Large Language Models (LLMs) performance on complex reasoning tasks, the substantial computational and memory costs of generating long CoT sequences limit their efficiency and practicality. Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes demonstrate that our framework not only improves the reasoning efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their reasoning performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic workflows has demonstrated strong performance of LLM-based agents in addressing complex reasoning tasks. However, existing workflow optimization methods typically formulate workflow synthesis as a static, one-shot code-centric generation problem. This paradigm imposes excessive constraints on the model's coding capabilities and restricts the flexibility required for dynamic problem-solving. In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmarks, Workflow-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, validating GSsPO as a generalized solution for sequential reasoning and establishing Workflow-R1 as a promising new paradigm for automated workflow optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled models capable of producing complex textual and visual outputs; however, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models. These findings highlight the potential of gSMILE to advance transparent, reliable, and responsible deployment of generative AI technologies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01207v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preference-based alignment is pivotal for training large reasoning models; however, standard methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, overlooking the evolving utility of training instances. This static approach often leads to inefficient or unstable optimization, as it wastes computation on trivial pairs with negligible gradients and suffers from noise induced by samples near uncertain decision boundaries. Facing these challenges, we propose SAGE (Stability-Aware Gradient Efficiency), a dynamic framework designed to enhance alignment reliability by maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of policy updates. Concretely, SAGE integrates a coarse-grained curriculum mechanism that refreshes candidate pools based on model competence with a fine-grained, stability-aware scoring function that prioritizes informative, confident errors while filtering out unstable samples. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAGE significantly accelerates convergence and outperforms static baselines, highlighting the critical role of policy-aware, stability-conscious data selection in reasoning alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are attractive for cost-sensitive and resource-limited settings due to their efficient, low-latency inference. However, they often struggle with complex, knowledge-intensive tasks that require structured reasoning and effective retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose FutureMind, a modular reasoning framework that equips SLMs with strategic thinking-pattern priors via adaptive knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). FutureMind introduces a dynamic reasoning pipeline composed of four key modules: Problem Analysis, Logical Reasoning, Strategy Planning, and Retrieval Guidance. This pipeline is augmented by three distinct retrieval paradigms that decompose complex queries into tractable subproblems, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval execution. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks, including 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle, and Frames, demonstrate the superiority of FutureMind. It consistently outperforms strong baselines such as Search-o1, achieving state-of-the-art results under free training conditions across diverse SLM architectures and scales. Beyond empirical gains, our analysis reveals that the process of thinking-pattern distillation is restricted by the cognitive bias bottleneck between the teacher (LLMs) and student (SLMs) models. This provides new perspectives on the transferability of reasoning skills, paving the way for the development of SLMs that combine efficiency with genuine cognitive capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01237v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on complex reasoning tasks by generating multiple chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but using a fixed token budget per query leads to over-computation on easy inputs and under-computation on hard ones. We introduce Predictive Scheduling, a plug-and-play framework that pre-runs lightweight predictors, an MLP on intermediate transformer hidden states or a LoRA-fine-tuned classifier on raw question text, to estimate each query's optimal reasoning length or difficulty before any full generation. Our greedy batch allocator dynamically distributes a fixed total token budget across queries to maximize expected accuracy. On the GSM8K arithmetic benchmark, predictive scheduling yields up to 7.9 percentage points of absolute accuracy gain over uniform budgeting at identical token cost, closing over 50\% of the gap to an oracle with perfect foresight. A systematic layer-wise study reveals that middle layers (12 - 17) of the transformer carry the richest signals for size estimation. These results demonstrate that pre-run budget prediction enables fine-grained control of the compute-accuracy trade-off, offering a concrete path toward latency-sensitive, cost-efficient LLM deployments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enterprise Knowledge Graphs have become essential for unifying heterogeneous data and enforcing semantic governance. However, the construction of their underlying ontologies remains a resource-intensive, manual process that relies heavily on domain expertise. This paper introduces OntoEKG, a LLM-driven pipeline designed to accelerate the generation of domain-specific ontologies from unstructured enterprise data. Our approach decomposes the modelling task into two distinct phases: an extraction module that identifies core classes and properties, and an entailment module that logically structures these elements into a hierarchy before serialising them into standard RDF. Addressing the significant lack of comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end ontology construction, we adopt a new evaluation dataset derived from documents across the Data, Finance, and Logistics sectors. Experimental results highlight both the potential and the challenges of this approach, achieving a fuzzy-match F1-score of 0.724 in the Data domain while revealing limitations in scope definition and hierarchical reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electronic medical records (EMRs), particularly in neurology, are inherently heterogeneous, sparse, and noisy, which poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnosis. In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While open sourced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have proliferated, selecting the optimal pretrained model for a specific downstream task remains challenging. Exhaustive evaluation is often infeasible due to computational constraints and data limitations in few shot scenarios. Existing selection methods fail to fully address this: they either rely on data-intensive proxies or use symmetric textual descriptors that neglect the inherently directional and model-specific nature of transferability. To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference. Experimental results on 48 VLMs across 21 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 14.7% improvement in NDCG@5 over SWAB.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01355v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aggregation query over free text is a long-standing yet underexplored problem. Unlike ordinary question answering, aggregate queries require exhaustive evidence collection and systems are required to "find all," not merely "find one." Existing paradigms such as Text-to-SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation fail to achieve this completeness. In this work, we formalize entity-level aggregation querying over text in a corpus-bounded setting with strict completeness requirement. To enable principled evaluation, we introduce AGGBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate completeness-oriented aggregation under realistic large-scale corpus. To accompany the benchmark, we propose DFA (Disambiguation--Filtering--Aggregation), a modular agentic baseline that decomposes aggregation querying into interpretable stages and exposes key failure modes related to ambiguity, filtering, and aggregation. Empirical results show that DFA consistently improves aggregation evidence coverage over strong RAG and agentic baselines. The data and code are available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DFA-A4C1.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear probes are a promising approach for monitoring AI systems for deceptive behaviour. Previous work has shown that a linear classifier trained on a contrastive instruction pair and a simple dataset can achieve good performance. However, these probes exhibit notable failures even in straightforward scenarios, including spurious correlations and false positives on non-deceptive responses. In this paper, we identify the importance of the instruction pair used during training. Furthermore, we show that targeting specific deceptive behaviors through a human-interpretable taxonomy of deception leads to improved results on evaluation datasets. Our findings reveal that instruction pairs capture deceptive intent rather than content-specific patterns, explaining why prompt choice dominates probe performance (70.6% of variance). Given the heterogeneity of deception types across datasets, we conclude that organizations should design specialized probes targeting their specific threat models rather than seeking a universal deception detector.

We introduce SimGym, a scalable system for rapid offline A/B testing using traffic-grounded synthetic buyers powered by Large Language Model agents operating in a live browser. SimGym extracts per-shop buyer profiles and intents from production interaction data, identifies distinct behavioral archetypes, and simulates cohort-weighted sessions across control and treatment storefronts. We validate SimGym against real human outcomes from real UI changes on a major e-commerce platform under confounder control. Even without alignment post training, SimGym agents achieve state of the art alignment with observed outcome shifts and reduces experiment cycles from weeks to under an hour , enabling rapid experimentation without exposure to real buyers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in individual software engineering tasks, yet most autonomous systems still treat issue resolution as a monolithic or pipeline-based process. In contrast, real-world software development is organized as a collaborative activity carried out by teams following shared methodologies, with clear role separation, communication, and review. In this work, we present a fully automated multi-agent system that explicitly models software engineering as an organizational process, replicating the structure of an engineering team. Built on top of agyn, an open-source platform for configuring agent teams, our system assigns specialized agents to roles such as coordination, research, implementation, and review, provides them with isolated sandboxes for experimentation, and enables structured communication. The system follows a defined development methodology for working on issues, including analysis, task specification, pull request creation, and iterative review, and operates without any human intervention. Importantly, the system was designed for real production use and was not tuned for SWE-bench. When evaluated post hoc on SWE-bench 500, it resolves 72.4% of tasks, outperforming single-agent baselines using comparable language models. Our results suggest that replicating team structure, methodology, and communication is a powerful paradigm for autonomous software engineering, and that future progress may depend as much on organizational design and agent infrastructure as on model improvements.

What limits or checks do we want to impose on AI development and deployment? But a key role for law is not only to establish substantive rules but also to establish legal and regulatory infrastructure to generate and implement rules. The transformative nature of AI calls especially for attention to building legal and regulatory frameworks. In this PNAS Perspective piece I review three examples I have proposed: the creation of registration regimes for frontier models; the creation of registration and identification regimes for autonomous agents; and the design of regulatory markets to facilitate a role for private companies to innovate and deliver AI regulatory services.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) is a fundamental yet computationally challenging problem arising in domains such as diagnosis, planning, and structured prediction. In many practical settings, the graphical model remains fixed while inference must be performed repeatedly for varying evidence patterns. Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms scale to large models but rely on myopic best-improvement rule that prioritizes immediate likelihood gains and often stagnate in poor local optima. Heuristics such as Guided Local Search (GLS+) partially alleviate this limitation by modifying the search landscape, but their guidance cannot be reused effectively across multiple inference queries on the same model. We propose a neural amortization framework for improving local search in this repeated-query regime. Exploiting the fixed graph structure, we train an attention-based network to score local moves by predicting their ability to reduce Hamming distance to a near-optimal solution. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing local search procedures, using this signal to balance short-term likelihood gains with long-term promise during neighbor selection. We provide theoretical intuition linking distance-reducing move selection to improved convergence behavior, and empirically demonstrate consistent improvements over SLS and GLS+ on challenging high-treewidth benchmarks in the amortized inference setting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Top-k and Top-p are the dominant truncation operators in the sampling of large language models. Despite their widespread use, implementing them efficiently over large vocabularies remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Proactive agents must decide not only what to say but also whether and when to intervene. Many current systems rely on brittle heuristics or indiscriminate long reasoning, which offers little control over the benefit-burden tradeoff. We formulate the problem as cost-sensitive selective intervention and present PRISM, a novel framework that couples a decision-theoretic gate with a dual-process reasoning architecture. At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: "make haste slowly"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines. These results show that principled decision-theoretic gating, paired with selective slow reasoning and aligned distillation, yields proactive agents that are precise, computationally efficient, and controllable. To facilitate reproducibility, we release our code, models, and resources at https://prism-festinalente.github.io/; all experiments use the open-source ProactiveBench benchmark.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01539v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing defenses often lag behind evolving adversarial attacks due to their \textbf{reliance on static, pre-collected data distributions}. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential. Theoretically, we provide insights into a more robust game equilibrium and derive safety guarantees. Extensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior defense success rates without compromising the helpfulness of the model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern scientific research relies on large-scale data, complex workflows, and specialized tools, which existing LLMs and tool-based agents struggle to handle due to limitations in long-horizon planning, robust goal maintenance, and continual learning from execution. To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01556v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven AI systems are increasingly important for autonomous decision-making in dynamic and open environments. However, most existing systems rely on predefined tasks and fixed prompts, limiting their ability to autonomously identify what problems should be solved when environmental conditions change. In this paper, we propose a human-simulation-based framework that enables AI systems to autonomously form questions and set tasks by reasoning over their internal states, environmental observations, and interactions with other AI systems. The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive and diffusion models represent two complementary generative paradigms. Autoregressive models excel at sequential planning and constraint composition, yet struggle with tasks that require explicit spatial or physical grounding. Diffusion models, in contrast, capture rich spatial structure through high-dimensional generation, but lack the stepwise logical control needed to satisfy complex, multi-stage constraints or to reliably identify and correct errors. We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01610v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning effective region embeddings from heterogeneous urban data underpins key urban computing tasks (e.g., crime prediction, resource allocation). However, prevailing two-stage methods yield task-agnostic representations, decoupling them from downstream objectives. Recent prompt-based approaches attempt to fix this but introduce two challenges: they often lack explicit spatial priors, causing spatially incoherent inter-region modeling, and they lack robust mechanisms for explicit task-semantic alignment. We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment. ToPT consists of two modules: spatial-aware region embedding learning (SREL) and task-aware prompting for region embeddings (Prompt4RE). SREL employs a Graphormer-based fusion module that injects spatial priors-distance and regional centrality-as learnable attention biases to capture coherent, interpretable inter-region interactions. Prompt4RE performs task-oriented prompting: a frozen multimodal large language model (MLLM) processes task-specific templates to obtain semantic vectors, which are aligned with region embeddings via multi-head cross-attention for stable task conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks and cities show state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 64.2\%, validating the necessity and complementarity of spatial priors and prompt-region alignment. The code is available at https://github.com/townSeven/Prompt4RE.git.

We introduce ProjDevBench, an end-to-end benchmark that provides project requirements to coding agents and evaluates the resulting repositories. Combining Online Judge (OJ) testing with LLM-assisted code review, the benchmark evaluates agents on (1) system architecture design, (2) functional correctness, and (3) iterative solution refinement. We curate 20 programming problems across 8 categories, covering both concept-oriented tasks and real-world application scenarios, and evaluate six coding agents built on different LLM backends. Our evaluation reports an overall acceptance rate of 27.38%: agents handle basic functionality and data structures but struggle with complex system design, time complexity optimization, and resource management.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01664v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, a variety of powerful agentic workflows have been applied to solve a wide range of human problems. However, existing workflow orchestration still faces key challenges, including high manual cost, reliance on specific operators/large language models (LLMs), and sparse reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSteer, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that takes a lightweight policy model as the agent and an executable canvas environment, automating workflow orchestration through multi-turn interaction. In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement. Moreover, FlowSteer provides a plug-and-play framework that supports diverse operator libraries and interchangeable LLM backends. To effectively train this interaction paradigm, we propose Canvas Workflow Relative Policy Optimization (CWRPO), which introduces diversity-constrained rewards with conditional release to stabilize learning and suppress shortcut behaviors. Experimental results on twelve datasets show that FlowSteer significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{TRIP-Bench}, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\% on hard subsets. We further propose \textbf{GTPO}, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01689v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Characterizing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings is critical for reliable monitoring and AI safety. However, most existing analyses rely on topic- or task-specific prompts, which can substantially limit what can be observed. In this work, we study what LLMs generate from minimal, topic-neutral inputs and probe their near-unconstrained generative behavior. Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family. For instance, degenerate outputs from Llama include multiple URLs pointing to personal Facebook and Instagram accounts. We release the complete dataset of 256,000 samples from 16 LLMs, along with a reproducible codebase.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent reasoning compresses the chain-of-thought (CoT) into continuous hidden states, yet existing methods rely on dense latent transitions that remain difficult to interpret and control. Meanwhile, sparse representation models uncover human-interpretable semantic features but remain largely confined to post-hoc analysis. We reconcile this tension by proposing LSTR (Latent Sparse Transcoder Reasoning), a latent reasoning framework that elevates functional sparse transcoders into active reasoning operators to perform multi-step computation through sparse semantic transitions. At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01699v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01711v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in enterprise workflows, yet their performance remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01740v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video language models (Video-LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, often generating plausible but ungrounded content when visual evidence is weak, ambiguous, or biased. Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families. The method is especially effective in challenging scenarios involving small, occluded, or co-occurring objects. Our code and data will be publicly released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objectives implicitly fix an equal mixing of forward and backward policies, potentially constraining the exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. By further exploring the link between GFlowNets and Markov chains, we establish an equivalence between GFlowNet objectives and Markov chain reversibility, thereby revealing the origin of such constraints, and provide a framework for adapting Markov chain properties to GFlowNets. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose $\alpha$-GFNs, which generalize the mixing via a tunable parameter $\alpha$. This generalization enables direct control over exploration-exploitation dynamics to enhance mode discovery capabilities, while ensuring convergence to unique flows. Across various benchmarks, including Set, Bit Sequence, and Molecule Generation, $\alpha$-GFN objectives consistently outperform previous GFlowNet objectives, achieving up to a $10 \times$ increase in the number of discovered modes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01750v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where models exploit spurious correlations in learned reward models to achieve high scores while violating human intent. Existing mitigations rely on static defenses that cannot adapt to novel exploitation strategies. We propose Adversarial Reward Auditing (ARA), a framework that reconceptualizes reward hacking as a dynamic, competitive game. ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01762v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), constrained by their auto-regressive nature, suffer from slow decoding. Speculative decoding methods have emerged as a promising solution to accelerate LLM decoding, attracting attention from both systems and AI research communities. Recently, the pursuit of better draft quality has driven a trend toward parametrically larger draft models, which inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. While existing work attempts to balance the trade-off between prediction accuracy and compute latency, we address this fundamental dilemma through architectural innovation.   We propose PRISM, which disaggregates the computation of each predictive step across different parameter sets, refactoring the computational pathways of draft models to successfully decouple model capacity from inference cost. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms all existing draft architectures, achieving exceptional acceptance lengths while maintaining minimal draft latency for superior end-to-end speedup. We also re-examine scaling laws with PRISM, revealing that PRISM scales more effectively with expanding data volumes than other draft architectures. Through rigorous and fair comparison, we show that PRISM boosts the decoding throughput of an already highly optimized inference engine by more than 2.6x.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying new architectures in large-scale user response prediction systems incurs high model switching costs due to expensive retraining on massive historical data and performance degradation under data retention constraints. Existing knowledge distillation methods struggle with architectural heterogeneity and the prohibitive cost of transferring large embedding tables. We propose CrossAdapt, a two-stage framework for efficient cross-architecture knowledge transfer. The offline stage enables rapid embedding transfer via dimension-adaptive projections without iterative training, combined with progressive network distillation and strategic sampling to reduce computational cost. The online stage introduces asymmetric co-distillation, where students update frequently while teachers update infrequently, together with a distribution-aware adaptation mechanism that dynamically balances historical knowledge preservation and fast adaptation to evolving data. Experiments on three public datasets show that CrossAdapt achieves 0.27-0.43% AUC improvements while reducing training time by 43-71%. Large-scale deployment on Tencent WeChat Channels (~10M daily samples) further demonstrates its effectiveness, significantly mitigating AUC degradation, LogLoss increase, and prediction bias compared to standard distillation baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01779v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly in medical NLP, yet Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with its distinctive ontology, terminology, and reasoning patterns requires domain-faithful evaluation. Existing TCM benchmarks are fragmented in coverage and scale and rely on non-unified or generation-heavy scoring that hinders fair comparison. We present the LingLanMiDian (LingLan) benchmark, a large-scale, expert-curated, multi-task suite that unifies evaluation across knowledge recall, multi-hop reasoning, information extraction, and real-world clinical decision-making. LingLan introduces a consistent metric design, a synonym-tolerant protocol for clinical labels, a per-dataset 400-item Hard subset, and a reframing of diagnosis and treatment recommendation into single-choice decision recognition. We conduct comprehensive, zero-shot evaluations on 14 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs, providing a unified perspective on their strengths and limitations in TCM commonsense knowledge understanding, reasoning, and clinical decision support; critically, the evaluation on Hard subset reveals a substantial gap between current models and human experts in TCM-specialized reasoning. By bridging fundamental knowledge and applied reasoning through standardized evaluation, LingLan establishes a unified, quantitative, and extensible foundation for advancing TCM LLMs and domain-specific medical AI research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01797v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale language models (LLMs) have made multi-agent architectures attractive for challenging reasoning tasks. However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01815v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating scientific discovery. To differentiate agent behavior in the multi-agent system, current frameworks typically assign generic role-based personas such as ''reviewer'' or ''writer'' or rely on coarse grained keyword-based personas. While functional, this approach oversimplifies how human scientists operate, whose contributions are shaped by their unique research trajectories. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, a framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors. These agents engage in multi-turn debate through proposal, critique, and voting phases. Our evaluation demonstrates that these fine-grained individuality-grounded agents consistently outperform systems relying on coarse-grained personas, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These results validate that capturing the ``scientific DNA'' of individual agents is essential for high-quality discovery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on multi-modal fusion for safety, but current visual and optical sensors fail to detect road-induced excitations which are critical for vehicles' dynamic control. Inspired by human synesthesia, we propose the Synesthesia of Vehicles (SoV), a novel framework to predict tactile excitations from visual inputs for autonomous vehicles. We develop a cross-modal spatiotemporal alignment method to address temporal and spatial disparities. Furthermore, a visual-tactile synesthetic (VTSyn) generative model using latent diffusion is proposed for unsupervised high-quality tactile data synthesis. A real-vehicle perception system collected a multi-modal dataset across diverse road and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments show that VTSyn outperforms existing models in temporal, frequency, and classification performance, enhancing AV safety through proactive tactile perception.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current agentic frameworks underperform on long-horizon tasks. As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5. Our results demonstrate that recursive, modular agent architectures can scale reasoning depth while remaining interpretable, flexible, and model-agnostic.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01858v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential for ensuring operational safety and consistency in industrial environments. However, retrieving and following these procedures presents unique challenges, such as rigid proprietary structures, condition-dependent relevance, and actionable execution requirement, which standard semantic-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms fail to address. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01869v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-driven agents demonstrate strong performance in sequential decision-making but often rely on on-the-fly reasoning, re-deriving solutions even in recurring scenarios. This insufficient experience reuse leads to computational redundancy and execution instability. To bridge this gap, we propose ProcMEM, a framework that enables agents to autonomously learn procedural memory from interaction experiences without parameter updates. By formalizing a Skill-MDP, ProcMEM transforms passive episodic narratives into executable Skills defined by activation, execution, and termination conditions to ensure executability. To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression. Visualized evolutionary trajectories and Skill distributions further reveal how ProcMEM transparently accumulates, refines, and reuses procedural knowledge to facilitate long-term autonomy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01884v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal reward models are crucial for aligning multimodal large language models with human preferences. Recent works have incorporated reasoning capabilities into these models, achieving promising results. However, training these models suffers from two critical challenges: (1) the inherent noise in preference datasets, which degrades model performance, and (2) the inefficiency of conventional training methods, which ignore the differences in sample difficulty. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between response entropy and accuracy, indicating that entropy can serve as a reliable and unsupervised proxy for annotation noise and sample difficulty. Based on this insight, we propose a novel Entropy-Guided Training (EGT) approach for multimodal reasoning reward models, which combines two strategies: (1) entropy-guided data curation to mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, and (2) an entropy-guided training strategy that progressively introduces more complex examples. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show that the EGT-trained model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal reward models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01893v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a geometric framework for analysing multi-head attention in large language models (LLMs). Without altering the mechanism, we view standard attention through a top-N selection lens and study its behaviour directly in value-state space. We define geometric metrics - Precision, Recall, and F-score - to quantify separability between selected and non-selected tokens, and derive non-asymptotic bounds with explicit dependence on dimension and margin under empirically motivated assumptions (stable value norms with a compressed sink token, exponential similarity decay, and piecewise attention weight profiles). The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01910v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Smart-home sensor data holds significant potential for several applications, including healthcare monitoring and assistive technologies. Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01933v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Topic modeling is a research field finding increasing applications: historically from document retrieving, to sentiment analysis and text summarization. Large Language Models (LLM) are currently a major trend in text processing, but few works study their usefulness for this task. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has recently been presented as a candidate for topic modeling, but no real applied case study has been conducted. In this work, we compare LLM and FCA to better understand their strengths and weakneses in the topic modeling field. FCA is evaluated through the CREA pipeline used in past experiments on topic modeling and visualization, whereas GPT-5 is used for the LLM. A strategy based on three prompts is applied with GPT-5 in a zero-shot setup: topic generation from document batches, merging of batch results into final topics, and topic labeling. A first experiment reuses the teaching materials previously used to evaluate CREA, while a second experiment analyzes 40 research articles in information systems to compare the extracted topics with the underling subfields.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models but often involves high computational costs due to rollout-intensive optimization. Online prompt selection presents a plausible solution by prioritizing informative prompts to improve training efficiency. However, current methods either depend on costly, exact evaluations or construct prompt-specific predictive models lacking generalization across prompts. This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches. The small predictive model also generalizes at test-time for efficient computational allocation. Experiments across varied reasoning benchmarks indicate GPS's substantial improvements in training efficiency, final performance, and test-time efficiency over superior baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01983v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) models have effectively extended the question-answering capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external tools. However, real-world scenarios present numerous open-ended problems where fixed tools often fail to meet task requirements. Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models. In particular, the significant performance gains achieved +20.86%$\uparrow$ and +23.04%$\uparrow$ on benchmarks across multi-domain mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks validate the self-evolving capability of the agent.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Analogy is a central faculty of human intelligence, enabling abstract patterns discovered in one domain to be applied to another. Despite its central role in cognition, the mechanisms by which Transformers acquire and implement analogical reasoning remain poorly understood. In this work, inspired by the notion of functors in category theory, we formalize analogical reasoning as the inference of correspondences between entities across categories. Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy. Finally, we quantify these effects and find that the same trends are observed in pretrained LLMs. In doing so, we move analogy from an abstract cognitive notion to a concrete, mechanistically grounded phenomenon in modern neural networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01995v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conversational diagnosis requires multi-turn history-taking, where an agent asks clarifying questions to refine differential diagnoses under incomplete information. Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model or assume that patients provide rich and concrete information, which is unrealistic. To address these limitations, we propose a conversational diagnosis system that explores a diagnostic knowledge graph to reason in two steps: (i) generating diagnostic hypotheses from the dialogue context, and (ii) verifying hypotheses through clarifying questions, which are repeated until a final diagnosis is reached. Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV. We further adapt it to describe symptoms vaguely to reflect real-world patients during early clinical encounters. Experiments show improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines, and evaluations by physicians support the realism of our simulator and the clinical utility of the generated questions. Our code will be released upon publication.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02018v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Factual hallucination remains a central challenge for large language models (LLMs). Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior. We propose VeriFY, a training-time framework that teaches LLMs to reason about factual uncertainty through consistency-based self-verification. VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source. The source code, training data, and trained model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly emerged as a fundamental aspect of their development. Existing safety alignment for LLMs is predominantly achieved through post-training methods, which are computationally expensive and often fail to generalize well across different models. A small number of lightweight alignment approaches either rely heavily on prior-computed safety injections or depend excessively on the model's own capabilities, resulting in limited generalization and degraded efficiency and usability during generation. In this work, we propose a safety-aware decoding method that requires only low-cost training of an expert model and employs a single neuron as a gating mechanism. By effectively balancing the model's intrinsic capabilities with external guidance, our approach simultaneously preserves utility and enhances output safety. It demonstrates clear advantages in training overhead and generalization across model scales, offering a new perspective on lightweight alignment for the safe and practical deployment of large language models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enabling artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models, to integrate new knowledge and flexibly apply it during reasoning remains a central challenge. Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02029v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatically formulating optimization models from natural language descriptions is a growing focus in operations research, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with the composite constraints and appropriate modeling paradigms required by complex operational rules. To address this, we introduce the Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR): a schema that LLMs explicitly generate between problem descriptions and optimization models. CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate). On established benchmarks from the literature, R2C delivers highly competitive results, approaching the performance of proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5). Moreover, with a reflection mechanism, R2C achieves further gains and sets new best-reported results on some benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02034v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to perform complex, multi-step workflows in regulated settings such as compliance and due diligence. However, many agentic architectures rely primarily on prompt engineering of a single agent, making it difficult to observe or compare how models handle uncertainty and coordination across interconnected decision stages and with human oversight. We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced processing time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The agency expected of Agentic Large Language Models goes beyond answering correctly, requiring autonomy to set goals and decide what to explore. We term this investigatory intelligence, distinguishing it from executional intelligence, which merely completes assigned tasks. Data Science provides a natural testbed, as real-world analysis starts from raw data rather than explicit queries, yet few benchmarks focus on it. To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, a large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation. Results show that while frontier models display emerging agency, long-horizon exploration remains challenging. Our analysis highlights that effective investigatory intelligence depends not only on agent scaffolding or merely scaling, but also on intrinsic strategies of agentic models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tool-using agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and multi-hop question answering. However, in long trajectories, agents often trigger excessive and low-quality tool calls, increasing latency and degrading inference performance, making managing tool-use behavior challenging. In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%. These results position entropy reduction as a key mechanism for enhancing tool-use behavior, enabling agents to be more adaptive in real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, enabling high-quality and photorealistic image synthesis. However, their practical deployment remains hindered by several limitations: sensitivity to prompt phrasing, ambiguity in semantic interpretation (e.g., ``mouse" as animal vs. a computer peripheral), artifacts such as distorted anatomy, and the need for carefully engineered input prompts. Existing methods often require additional training and offer limited controllability, restricting their adaptability in real-world applications. We introduce Self-Improving Diffusion Agent (SIDiffAgent), a training-free agentic framework that leverages the Qwen family of models (Qwen-VL, Qwen-Image, Qwen-Edit, Qwen-Embedding) to address these challenges. SIDiffAgent autonomously manages prompt engineering, detects and corrects poor generations, and performs fine-grained artifact removal, yielding more reliable and consistent outputs. It further incorporates iterative self-improvement by storing a memory of previous experiences in a database. This database of past experiences is then used to inject prompt-based guidance at each stage of the agentic pipeline. \modelour achieved an average VQA score of 0.884 on GenAIBench, significantly outperforming open-source, proprietary models and agentic methods. We will publicly release our code upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02133v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) suffer from the reversal curse: after learning that "$A$ is $B$", they often fail on the reverse query "$B$ is $A$". Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing "[MASK] is $B$" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt "$B$ is [MASK]". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02136v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safety alignment incurs safety tax that perturbs a large reasoning model's (LRM) general reasoning ability. Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \textbf{+30.2\%} on DirectRefusal and \textbf{+21.2\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This project compares three graph search approaches for the task of traffic-aware navigation in Kingston's road network. These approaches include a single-run multi-query preprocessing algorithm (Floyd-Warshall-Ingerman), continuous single-query real-time search (Dijkstra's and A*), and an algorithm combining both approaches to balance between their trade-offs by first finding the top K shortest paths then iterating over them in real time (Yen's). Dijkstra's and A* resulted in the most traffic-aware optimal solutions with minimal preprocessing required. Floyd-Warshall-Ingerman was the fastest in real time but provided distance based paths with no traffic awareness. Yen's algorithm required significant preprocessing but balanced between the other two approaches in terms of runtime speed and optimality. Each approach presents advantages and disadvantages that need to be weighed depending on the circumstances of specific deployment contexts to select the best custom solution. *This project was completed as part of ELEC 844 (Search and Planning Algorithms for Robotics) in the Fall 2025 term.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in math and logic reasoning, their ability to handle combinatorial optimization (CO) -- searching high-dimensional solution spaces under hard constraints -- remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce NLCO, a \textbf{N}atural \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}ombinatorial \textbf{O}ptimization benchmark that evaluates LLMs on end-to-end CO reasoning: given a language-described decision-making scenario, the model must output a discrete solution without writing code or calling external solvers. NLCO covers 43 CO problems and is organized using a four-layer taxonomy of variable types, constraint families, global patterns, and objective classes, enabling fine-grained evaluation. We provide solver-annotated solutions and comprehensively evaluate LLMs by feasibility, solution optimality, and reasoning efficiency. Experiments across a wide range of modern LLMs show that high-performing models achieve strong feasibility and solution quality on small instances, but both degrade as instance size grows, even if more tokens are used for reasoning. We also observe systematic effects across the taxonomy: set-based tasks are relatively easy, whereas graph-structured problems and bottleneck objectives lead to more frequent failures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can theoretically support extensive context windows, their actual deployment is constrained by the linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache memory. Prevailing compression strategies mitigate this through various pruning mechanisms, yet trade-off semantic recall for memory efficiency. In this work, we present LASER-KV (Layer Accumulated Selection with Exact-LSH Recall), a framework designed to test the limits of KV compression under a strict accumulative budgeting policy. We deviate from the standard fixed summary size approach by implementing a block-wise accumulation strategy governed by a protection divisor (n). This allows us to isolate the effects of compression from sliding window artifacts. Our experiments on the Babilong benchmark reveal performance degradation in previous compression methods by 15-30% on various long context tasks. LASER-KV maintains stable performance, achieving superior accuracies by a margin of upto 10% at 128k. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that attention scores alone are a sufficient proxy for token utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale foundation models exhibit behavioral shifts: intervention-induced behavioral changes that appear after scaling, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning or in-context learning. While investigating these phenomena have recently received attention, explaining their appearance is still overlooked. Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($\Delta$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $\Delta$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $\Delta$-XAI experiment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities in solving complex real-world problems. Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02350v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-Agent Discussion (MAD) has garnered increasing attention very recently, where multiple LLM instances collaboratively solve problems via structured discussion. However, we find that current MAD methods easily suffer from discussion inconsistency, LLMs fail to reach a coherent solution, due to the misalignment between their individual contexts.In this paper, we introduce a multi-LLM context learning method (M2CL) that learns a context generator for each agent, capable of dynamically generating context instructions per discussion round via automatic information organization and refinement. Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus. We evaluate M2CL on challenging tasks, including academic reasoning, embodied tasks, and mobile control. The results show that the performance of M2CL significantly surpasses existing methods by 20%--50%, while enjoying favorable transferability and computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly equipped with memory, which are stored experience and reusable guidance that can improve task-solving performance. Recent \emph{self-evolving} systems update memory based on interaction outcomes, but most existing evolution pipelines are developed for static train/test splits and only approximate online learning by folding static benchmarks, making them brittle under true distribution shift and continuous feedback. We introduce \textsc{Live-Evo}, an online self-evolving memory system that learns from a stream of incoming data over time. \textsc{Live-Evo} decouples \emph{what happened} from \emph{how to use it} via an Experience Bank and a Meta-Guideline Bank, compiling task-adaptive guidelines from retrieved experiences for each task. To manage memory online, \textsc{Live-Evo} maintains experience weights and updates them from feedback: experiences that consistently help are reinforced and retrieved more often, while misleading or stale experiences are down-weighted and gradually forgotten, analogous to reinforcement and decay in human memory. On the live \textit{Prophet Arena} benchmark over a 10-week horizon, \textsc{Live-Evo} improves Brier score by 20.8\% and increases market returns by 12.9\%, while also transferring to deep-research benchmarks with consistent gains over strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02386v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How should Large Language Model (LLM) practitioners select the right model for a task without wasting money? We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02416v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-correction in language models remains elusive. In this work, we explore whether language models can explicitly localize errors in incorrect reasoning, as a path toward building AI systems that can effectively correct themselves. We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02419v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding aims to translate natural language instructions into executable screen coordinates, enabling automated GUI interaction. Nevertheless, incorrect grounding can result in costly, hard-to-reverse actions (e.g., erroneous payment approvals), raising concerns about model reliability. In this paper, we introduce SafeGround, an uncertainty-aware framework for GUI grounding models that enables risk-aware predictions through calibrations before testing. SafeGround leverages a distribution-aware uncertainty quantification method to capture the spatial dispersion of stochastic samples from outputs of any given model. Then, through the calibration process, SafeGround derives a test-time decision threshold with statistically guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control. We apply SafeGround on multiple GUI grounding models for the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Experimental results show that our uncertainty measure consistently outperforms existing baselines in distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions, while the calibrated threshold reliably enables rigorous risk control and potentials of substantial system-level accuracy improvements. Across multiple GUI grounding models, SafeGround improves system-level accuracy by up to 5.38\% percentage points over Gemini-only inference.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02453v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has driven large language models to extend from thinking with text to thinking with images and videos. However, different modalities still have clear limitations: static images struggle to represent temporal structure, while videos introduce substantial redundancy and computational cost. In this work, we propose Thinking with Comics, a visual reasoning paradigm that uses comics as a high information-density medium positioned between images and videos. Comics preserve temporal structure, embedded text, and narrative coherence while requiring significantly lower reasoning cost. We systematically study two reasoning paths based on comics and evaluate them on a range of reasoning tasks and long-context understanding tasks. Experimental results show that Thinking with Comics outperforms Thinking with Images on multi-step temporal and causal reasoning tasks, while remaining substantially more efficient than Thinking with Video. Further analysis indicates that different comic narrative structures and styles consistently affect performance across tasks, suggesting that comics serve as an effective intermediate visual representation for improving multimodal reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02455v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Large Language Models transition to autonomous agents, user inputs frequently violate cooperative assumptions (e.g., implicit intent, missing parameters, false presuppositions, or ambiguous expressions), creating execution risks that text-only evaluations do not capture. Existing benchmarks typically assume well-specified instructions or restrict evaluation to text-only, single-turn clarification, and thus do not measure multi-turn disambiguation under grounded execution risk. We introduce \textbf{Drift-Bench}, the first diagnostic benchmark that evaluates agentic pragmatics under input faults through multi-turn clarification across state-oriented and service-oriented execution environments. Grounded in classical theories of communication, \textbf{Drift-Bench} provides a unified taxonomy of cooperative breakdowns and employs a persona-driven user simulator with the \textbf{Rise} evaluation protocol. Experiments show substantial performance drops under these faults, with clarification effectiveness varying across user personas and fault types. \MethodName bridges clarification research and agent safety evaluation, enabling systematic diagnosis of failures that can lead to unsafe executions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Frontier models are transitioning from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that merely ingest visual information to unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of native interleaved generation. This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02468v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal large language models, autonomous web agents still struggle to reliably execute long-horizon tasks on complex and dynamic web interfaces. Existing agents often suffer from inaccurate element grounding, the absence of site-specific procedural knowledge, and unstable long-term task tracking and memory, particularly when operating over complex Document Object Model structures. To address these limitations, we introduce Avenir-Web, a web agent that achieves a new open-source state of the art on the Online-Mind2Web benchmark in real-world deployment. Avenir-Web leverages a Mixture of Grounding Experts, Experience-Imitation Planning for incorporating procedural priors, and a task-tracking checklist combined with adaptive memory to enable robust and seamless interaction across diverse user interface paradigms. We evaluate Avenir-Web on Online-Mind2Web, a rigorous benchmark of live and user-centered web tasks. Our results demonstrate that Avenir-Web significantly surpasses prior open-source agents and attains performance parity with top-tier proprietary models, thereby establishing a new open-source state of the art for reliable web agents on live websites.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02470v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many complex tasks, yet they can still fail in very simple logical reasoning such as the "reversal curse" -- when trained on forward knowledge data of the form "$A \rightarrow B$" (e.g., Alice's husband is Bob), the model is unable to deduce the reversal knowledge "$B \leftarrow A$" (e.g., Bob's wife is Alice) during test. Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form "$A \to A$" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI agents often fail in ways that are difficult to localize because executions are probabilistic, long-horizon, multi-agent, and mediated by noisy tool outputs. We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions in partially observed 3D environments, motivating map representations that aggregate spatial context beyond local perception. However, most existing approaches rely on hand-crafted maps constructed independently of the navigation policy. We argue that maps should instead be learned representations shaped directly by navigation objectives rather than exhaustive reconstructions. Based on this insight, we propose MapDream, a map-in-the-loop framework that formulates map construction as autoregressive bird's-eye-view (BEV) image synthesis. The framework jointly learns map generation and action prediction, distilling environmental context into a compact three-channel BEV map that preserves only navigation-critical affordances. Supervised pre-training bootstraps a reliable mapping-to-control interface, while the autoregressive design enables end-to-end joint optimization through reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE achieve state-of-the-art monocular performance, validating task-driven generative map learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00401v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving robust, human-like whole-body control on humanoid robots for agile, contact-rich behaviors remains a central challenge, demanding heavy per-skill engineering and a brittle process of tuning controllers. We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00480v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving scalable coordination in large robotic swarms is often constrained by reliance on inter-agent communication, which introduces latency, bandwidth limitations, and vulnerability to failure. To address this gap, a decentralized approach for outer-loop control of large multi-agent systems based on the paradigm of how a fluid moves through a volume is proposed and evaluated. A relationship between fundamental fluidic element properties and individual robotic agent states is developed such that the corresponding swarm "flows" through a space, akin to a fluid when forced via a pressure boundary condition. By ascribing fluid-like properties to subsets of agents, the swarm evolves collectively while maintaining desirable structure and coherence without explicit communication of agent states within or outside of the swarm. The approach is evaluated using simulations involving $O(10^3)$ quadcopter agents and compared against Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions for a converging-diverging domain. Quantitative agreement between swarm-derived and CFD fields is assessed using Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), yielding normalized errors of 0.15-0.9 for velocity, 0.61-0.98 for density, 0-0.937 for pressure. These results demonstrate the feasibility of treating large robotic swarms as continuum systems that retain the macroscopic structure derived from first principles, providing a basis for scalable and decentralized control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00500v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become foundational to modern embodied AI systems. By integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action planning, they enable general-purpose task execution across diverse environments. Despite their importance, the security of VLA models remains underexplored -- particularly in the context of backdoor attacks, which pose realistic threats in physical-world deployments. While recent methods attempt to inject backdoors into VLA models, these backdoors are easily erased during downstream adaptation, as user-side fine-tuning with clean data significantly alters model parameters, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose INFUSE (INjection into Fine-tUne-inSensitive modulEs), the first backdoor attack framework for VLA base models that remains effective even with arbitrary user fine-tuning. INFUSE begins by analyzing parameter sensitivity across diverse fine-tuning scenarios to identify modules that remain largely unchanged -- the fine-tune-insensitive modules. It then injects backdoors into these stable modules while freezing the rest, ensuring malicious behavior persists after extensive user fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VLA architectures demonstrate INFUSE's effectiveness. After user-side fine-tuning, INFUSE maintains mean attack success rates of 91.0% on simulation environments and 79.8% on real-world robot tasks, substantially surpassing BadVLA (38.8% and 36.6%, respectively), while preserving clean-task performance comparable to standard models. These results uncover a critical threat: backdoors implanted before distribution can persist through fine-tuning and remain effective at deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00514v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic manipulation in contact-rich environments remains challenging, particularly when relying on conventional tactile sensors that suffer from limited sensing range, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. In this work, we present LVTG, a low-cost visuo-tactile gripper designed for stable, robust, and efficient physical interaction. Unlike existing visuo-tactile sensors, LVTG enables more effective and stable grasping of larger and heavier everyday objects, thanks to its enhanced tactile sensing area and greater opening angle. Its surface skin is made of highly wear-resistant material, significantly improving durability and extending operational lifespan. The integration of vision and tactile feedback allows LVTG to provide rich, high-fidelity sensory data, facilitating reliable perception during complex manipulation tasks. Furthermore, LVTG features a modular design that supports rapid maintenance and replacement. To effectively fuse vision and touch, We adopt a CLIP-inspired contrastive learning objective to align tactile embeddings with their corresponding visual observations, enabling a shared cross-modal representation space for visuo-tactile perception. This alignment improves the performance of an Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) policy in contact-rich manipulation, leading to more efficient data collection and more effective policy learning. Compared to the original ACT method, the proposed LVTG with pretraining achieves significantly higher success rates in manipulation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00551v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial Object Goal Navigation, a challenging frontier in Embodied AI, requires an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agent to autonomously explore, reason, and identify a specific target using only visual perception and language description. However, existing methods struggle with the memorization of complex spatial representations in aerial environments, reliable and interpretable action decision-making, and inefficient exploration and information gathering. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{APEX} (Aerial Parallel Explorer), a novel hierarchical agent designed for efficient exploration and target acquisition in complex aerial settings. APEX is built upon a modular, three-part architecture: 1) Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Mapping Memory, which leverages the zero-shot capability of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to dynamically construct high-resolution 3D Attraction, Exploration, and Obstacle maps, serving as an interpretable memory mechanism. 2) Action Decision Module, trained with reinforcement learning, which translates this rich spatial understanding into a fine-grained and robust control policy. 3) Target Grounding Module, which employs an open-vocabulary detector to achieve definitive and generalizable target identification. All these components are integrated into a hierarchical, asynchronous, and parallel framework, effectively bypassing the VLM's inference latency and boosting the agent's proactivity in exploration. Extensive experiments show that APEX outperforms the previous state of the art by +4.2\% SR and +2.8\% SPL on challenging UAV-ON benchmarks, demonstrating its superior efficiency and the effectiveness of its hierarchical asynchronous design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00557v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve preliminary generalization through pretraining on large scale robot teleoperation datasets. However, acquiring datasets that comprehensively cover diverse tasks and environments is extremely costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, human demonstration videos offer a rich and scalable source of diverse scenes and manipulation behaviors, yet their lack of explicit action supervision hinders direct utilization. Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00566v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Motion simulation, prediction and planning are foundational tasks in autonomous driving, each essential for modeling and reasoning about dynamic traffic scenarios. While often addressed in isolation due to their differing objectives, such as generating diverse motion states or estimating optimal trajectories, these tasks inherently depend on shared capabilities: understanding multi-agent interactions, modeling motion behaviors, and reasoning over temporal and spatial dynamics. Despite this underlying commonality, existing approaches typically adopt specialized model designs, which hinders cross-task generalization and system scalability. More critically, this separation overlooks the potential mutual benefits among tasks. Motivated by these observations, we propose UniMotion, a unified motion framework that captures shared structures across motion tasks while accommodating their individual requirements. Built on a decoder-only Transformer architecture, UniMotion employs dedicated interaction modes and tailored training strategies to simultaneously support these motion tasks. This unified design not only enables joint optimization and representation sharing but also allows for targeted fine-tuning to specialize in individual tasks when needed. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that joint training leads to robust generalization and effective task integration. With further fine-tuning, UniMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of motion tasks, establishing it as a versatile and scalable solution for autonomous driving.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00575v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is pivotal for the continuous evolution of GUI agents, yet existing evaluation paradigms face significant limitations. Rule-based methods suffer from poor scalability and cannot handle open-ended tasks, while LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely on passive visual observation, often failing to capture latent system states due to partial state observability. To address these challenges, we advocate for a paradigm shift from passive evaluation to Agentic Interactive Verification. We introduce VAGEN, a framework that employs a verifier agent equipped with interaction tools to autonomously plan verification strategies and proactively probe the environment for evidence of task completion. Leveraging the insight that GUI tasks are typically "easy to verify but hard to solve", VAGEN overcomes the bottlenecks of visual limitations. Experimental results on OSWorld-Verified and AndroidWorld benchmarks demonstrate that VAGEN significantly improves evaluation accuracy compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baselines and further enhances performance through test-time scaling strategies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dialogue-based human-robot interaction requires robot cognitive assistants to maintain persistent user context, recover from underspecified requests, and ground responses in external evidence, while keeping intermediate decisions verifiable. In this paper we introduce JANUS, a cognitive architecture for assistive robots that models interaction as a partially observable Markov decision process and realizes control as a factored controller with typed interfaces. To this aim, Janus (i) decomposes the overall behavior into specialized modules, related to scope detection, intent recognition, memory, inner speech, query generation, and outer speech, and (ii) exposes explicit policies for information sufficiency, execution readiness, and tool grounding. A dedicated memory agent maintains a bounded recent-history buffer, a compact core memory, and an archival store with semantic retrieval, coupled through controlled consolidation and revision policies. Models inspired by the notion of inner speech in cognitive theories provide a control-oriented internal textual flow that validates parameter completeness and triggers clarification before grounding, while a faithfulness constraint ties robot-to-human claims to an evidence bundle combining working context and retrieved tool outputs. We evaluate JANUS through module-level unit tests in a dietary assistance domain grounded on a knowledge graph, reporting high agreement with curated references and practical latency profiles. These results support factored reasoning as a promising path to scalable, auditable, and evidence-grounded robot assistance over extended interaction horizons.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning has shown strong promise for quadrupedal agile locomotion, even with proprioception-only sensing. In practice, however, sim-to-real gap and reward overfitting in complex terrains can produce policies that fail to transfer, while physical validation remains risky and inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified framework encompassing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) locomotion policy for robust multi-terrain representation with RoboGauge, a predictive assessment suite that quantifies sim-to-real transferability. The MoE policy employs a gated set of specialist experts to decompose latent terrain and command modeling, achieving superior deployment robustness and generalization via proprioception alone. RoboGauge further provides multi-dimensional proprioception-based metrics via sim-to-sim tests over terrains, difficulty levels, and domain randomizations, enabling reliable MoE policy selection without extensive physical trials. Experiments on a Unitree Go2 demonstrate robust locomotion on unseen challenging terrains, including snow, sand, stairs, slopes, and 30 cm obstacles. In dedicated high-speed tests, the robot reaches 4 m/s and exhibits an emergent narrow-width gait associated with improved stability at high velocity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks, yet their substantial computational overhead remains a critical obstacle to real-world deployment. Improving inference efficiency is therefore essential for practical robotic applications. Existing acceleration methods often rely on heuristic or static strategies--such as rule-based token caching or pruning--that are decoupled from task objectives and fail to adapt to dynamic scene changes. In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines. This work highlights the potential of learning task-aware computational allocation policies, paving the way for VLA models that are both powerful and efficient.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00708v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-Shot Object Navigation in unknown environments poses significant challenges for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) due to the conflict between high-level semantic reasoning requirements and limited onboard computational resources. To address this, we present USS-Nav, a lightweight framework that incrementally constructs a Unified Spatio-Semantic scene graph and enables efficient Large Language Model (LLM)-augmented Zero-Shot Object Navigation in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce an incremental Spatial Connectivity Graph generation method utilizing polyhedral expansion to capture global geometric topology, which is dynamically partitioned into semantic regions via graph clustering. Concurrently, open-vocabulary object semantics are instantiated and anchored to this topology to form a hierarchical environmental representation. Leveraging this hierarchical structure, we present a coarse-to-fine exploration strategy: LLM grounded in the scene graph's semantics to determine global target regions, while a local planner optimizes frontier coverage based on information gain. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and real-time update frequency (15 Hz) on a resource-constrained platform. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our framework, showing substantial improvements in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). The source code will be made publicly available to foster further research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00743v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit strong generalization in robotic manipulation, yet reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning often degrades robustness under spatial distribution shifts. For flow-matching VLA policies, this degradation is closely associated with the erosion of spatial inductive bias during RL adaptation, as sparse rewards and spatially agnostic exploration increasingly favor short-horizon visual cues. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{SA-VLA}, a spatially-aware RL adaptation framework that preserves spatial grounding during policy optimization by aligning representation learning, reward design, and exploration with task geometry. SA-VLA fuses implicit spatial representations with visual tokens, provides dense rewards that reflect geometric progress, and employs \textbf{SCAN}, a spatially-conditioned annealed exploration strategy tailored to flow-matching dynamics. Across challenging multi-object and cluttered manipulation benchmarks, SA-VLA enables stable RL fine-tuning and improves zero-shot spatial generalization, yielding more robust and transferable behaviors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving systems demand trajectory planners that not only model the inherent uncertainty of future motions but also respect complex temporal dependencies and underlying physical laws. While diffusion-based generative models excel at capturing multi-modal distributions, they often fail to incorporate long-term sequential contexts and domain-specific physical priors. In this work, we bridge these gaps with two key innovations. First, we introduce a Diffusion Mamba Transformer architecture that embeds mamba and attention into the diffusion process, enabling more effective aggregation of sequential input contexts from sensor streams and past motion histories. Second, we design a Port-Hamiltonian Neural Network module that seamlessly integrates energy-based physical constraints into the diffusion model, thereby enhancing trajectory predictions with both consistency and interpretability. Extensive evaluations on standard autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our unified framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy, physical plausibility, and robustness, thereby advancing safe and reliable motion planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots to navigate complex outdoor environments safely. Existing self-supervised learning frameworks primarily rely on positive and unlabeled data; however, the lack of explicit negative data remains a critical limitation, hindering the model's ability to accurately identify diverse non-traversable regions. To address this issue, we introduce a method to explicitly construct synthetic negatives, representing plausible but non-traversable, and integrate them into vision-based traversability learning. Our approach is formulated as a training strategy that can be seamlessly integrated into both Positive-Unlabeled (PU) and Positive-Negative (PN) frameworks without modifying inference architectures. Complementing standard pixel-wise metrics, we introduce an object-centric FPR evaluation approach that analyzes predictions in regions where synthetic negatives are inserted. This evaluation provides an indirect measure of the model's ability to consistently identify non-traversable regions without additional manual labeling. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robustness and generalization across diverse environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00823v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are a highly promising technology for ocean exploration and diverse offshore operations, yet their practical deployment is constrained by energy efficiency and endurance. To address this, we propose Current-Harnessing Stage-Gated MPC, which exploits ocean currents via a per-stage scalar which indicates the "helpfulness" of ocean currents. This scalar is computed along the prediction horizon to gate lightweight cost terms only where the ocean currents truly aids the control goal. The proposed cost terms, that are merged in the objective function, are (i) a Monotone Cost Shaping (MCS) term, a help-gated, non-worsening modification that relaxes along-track position error and provides a bounded translational energy rebate, guaranteeing the shaped objective is never larger than a set baseline, and (ii) a speed-to-fly (STF) cost component that increases the price of thrust and softly matches ground velocity to the ocean current, enabling near zero water-relative "gliding". All terms are C1 and integrate as a plug-and-play in MPC designs. Extensive simulations with the BlueROV2 model under realistic ocean current fields show that the proposed approach achieves substantially lower energy consumption than conventional predictive control while maintaining comparable arrival times and constraint satisfaction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in unstructured, safety-critical environments, from planetary exploration to warehouses and homes, must learn to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings despite limited prior knowledge. Current methods for safe control, such as Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and Control Barrier Functions, assume known system dynamics. Meanwhile existing safe exploration techniques often fail to account for the unavoidable stochasticity inherent when operating in unknown real world environments, such as an exploratory rover skidding over an unseen surface or a household robot pushing around unmapped objects in a pantry. To address this critical gap, we propose Safe Stochastic Explorer (S.S.Explorer) a novel framework for safe, goal-driven exploration under stochastic dynamics. Our approach strategically balances safety and information gathering to reduce uncertainty about safety in the unknown environment. We employ Gaussian Processes to learn the unknown safety function online, leveraging their predictive uncertainty to guide information-gathering actions and provide probabilistic bounds on safety violations. We first present our method for discrete state space environments and then introduce a scalable relaxation to effectively extend this approach to continuous state spaces. Finally we demonstrate how this framework can be naturally applied to ensure safe physical interaction with multiple unknown objects. Extensive validation in simulation and demonstrative hardware experiments showcase the efficacy of our method, representing a step forward toward enabling reliable widespread robot autonomy in complex, uncertain environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low speed does not always guarantee safety in off-road driving. For instance, crossing a ditch may be risky at a low speed due to the risk of getting stuck, yet safe at a higher speed with a controlled, accelerated jump. Achieving such behavior requires path planning that explicitly models complex motion dynamics, whereas existing methods often neglect this aspect and plan solely based on positions or a fixed velocity. To address this gap, we introduce Motion-aware Traversability (MAT) representation to explicitly model terrain cost conditioned on actual robot motion. Instead of assigning a single scalar score for traversability, MAT models each terrain region as a Gaussian function of velocity. During online planning, we decompose the terrain cost computation into two stages: (1) predict terrain-dependent Gaussian parameters from perception in a single forward pass, (2) efficiently update terrain costs for new velocities inferred from current dynamics by evaluating these functions without repeated inference. We develop a system that integrates MAT to enable agile off-road navigation and evaluate it in both simulated and real-world environments with various obstacles. Results show that MAT achieves real-time efficiency and enhances the performance of off-road navigation, reducing path detours by 75% while maintaining safety across challenging terrains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00886v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies are a powerful paradigm for robotic control, but fine-tuning them with human preferences is fundamentally challenged by the multi-step structure of the denoising process. To overcome this, we introduce a Unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation that coherently integrates the diffusion denoising chain with environmental dynamics, enabling reward-free Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for diffusion policies. Building on this formulation, we propose RoDiF (Robust Direct Fine-Tuning), a method that explicitly addresses corrupted human preferences. RoDiF reinterprets the DPO objective through a geometric hypothesis-cutting perspective and employs a conservative cutting strategy to achieve robustness without assuming any specific noise distribution. Extensive experiments on long-horizon manipulation tasks show that RoDiF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively steering pretrained diffusion policies of diverse architectures to human-preferred modes, while maintaining strong performance even under 30% corrupted preference labels.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasping aims to generate stable and diverse grasps for robotic hands with heterogeneous kinematic structures. Existing methods are often tailored to specific hand designs and fail to generalize to unseen hand morphologies outside the training distribution. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{UniMorphGrasp}, a diffusion-based framework that incorporates hand morphological information into the grasp generation process for unified cross-embodiment grasp synthesis. The proposed approach maps grasps from diverse robotic hands into a unified human-like canonical hand pose representation, providing a common space for learning. Grasp generation is then conditioned on structured representations of hand kinematics, encoded as graphs derived from hand configurations, together with object geometry. In addition, a loss function is introduced that exploits the hierarchical organization of hand kinematics to guide joint-level supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMorphGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing dexterous grasp benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to previously unseen hand structures, enabling scalable and practical cross-embodiment grasp deployment.

Green-VLA follows a five stage curriculum: (L0) foundational VLMs, (L1) multimodal grounding, (R0) multi-embodiment pretraining, (R1) embodiment-specific adaptation, and (R2) reinforcement-learning (RL) policy alignment. We couple a scalable data-processing pipeline (3,000 hours of demonstrations) with temporal alignment and quality filtering, and use a unified, embodiment-aware action interface enabling a single policy to control humanoids, mobile manipulators, and fixed-base arms. At inference, the VLA controller is enhanced with episode-progress prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and joint-prediction-based guidance to improve safety and precise target selection. Experiments on Simpler BRIDGE WidowX and CALVIN ABC-D, as well as real-robot evaluations, show strong generalization and performance gains from RL alignment in success rate, robustness, and long-horizon efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The challenge of generating reliable local plans has long hindered practical applications in highly cluttered and dynamic environments. Key fundamental bottlenecks include acquiring large-scale expert demonstrations across diverse scenes and improving learning efficiency with limited data. This paper proposes SanD-Planner, a sample-efficient diffusion-based local planner that conducts depth image-based imitation learning within the clamped B-spline space. By operating within this compact space, the proposed algorithm inherently yields smooth outputs with bounded prediction errors over local supports, naturally aligning with receding-horizon execution. Integration of an ESDF-based safety checker with explicit clearance and time-to-completion metrics further reduces the training burden associated with value-function learning for feasibility assessment. Experiments show that training with $500$ episodes (merely $0.25\%$ of the demonstration scale used by the baseline), SanD-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluated open benchmark, attaining success rates of $90.1\%$ in simulated cluttered environments and $72.0\%$ in indoor simulations. The performance is further proven by demonstrating zero-shot transferability to realistic experimentation in both 2D and 3D scenes. The dataset and pre-trained models will also be open-sourced.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00935v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ants are highly capable of grasping objects in clutter, and we have recently observed that this involves substantial use of their forelegs. The forelegs, more specifically the tarsi, have high friction microstructures (setal pads), are covered in hairs, and have a flexible under-actuated tip. Here we abstract these features to test their functional advantages for a novel low-cost gripper design, suitable for bin-picking applications. In our implementation, the gripper legs are long and slim, with high friction gripping pads, low friction hairs and single-segment tarsus-like structure to mimic the insect's setal pads, hairs, and the tarsi's interactive compliance. Experimental evaluation shows this design is highly robust for grasping a wide variety of individual consumer objects, with all grasp attempts successful. In addition, we demonstrate this design is effective for picking single objects from dense clutter, a task at which ants also show high competence. The work advances grasping technology and shed new light on the mechanical importance of hairy structures and tarsal flexibility in insects.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00937v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained 2D image representations in behavior cloning policies has achieved great success and has become a standard approach for robotic manipulation. However, such representations fail to capture the 3D spatial information about objects and scenes that is essential for precise manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we show that CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six simulated tasks and five real-world tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00980v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The density-distribution method has recently become a promising paradigm owing to its adaptability to variations in swarm size. However, existing studies face practical challenges in achieving complex shape representation and decentralized implementation. This motivates us to develop a fully decentralized, distribution-based control strategy with the dual capability of forming complex shapes and adapting to swarm-size variations. Specifically, we first propose a discrete mass-distribution function defined over a set of sample points to model swarm formation. In contrast to the continuous density-distribution method, our model eliminates the requirement for defining continuous density functions-a task that is difficult for complex shapes. Second, we design a decentralized meanshift control law to coordinate the swarm's global distribution to fit the sample-point distribution by feeding back mass estimates. The mass estimates for all sample points are achieved by the robots in a decentralized manner via the designed mass estimator. It is shown that the mass estimates of the sample points can asymptotically converge to the true global values. To validate the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate the efficiency of complex shape formation and adaptability to swarm-size variations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In many robot motion planning problems, task objectives and physical constraints induce non-Euclidean geometry on the configuration space, yet many planners operate using Euclidean distances that ignore this structure. We address the problem of planning collision-free motions that minimize length under configuration-dependent Riemannian metrics, corresponding to geodesics on the configuration manifold. Conventional numerical methods for computing such paths do not scale well to high-dimensional systems, while sampling-based planners trade scalability for geometric fidelity. To bridge this gap, we propose a sampling-based motion planning framework that operates directly on Riemannian manifolds. We introduce a computationally efficient midpoint-based approximation of the Riemannian geodesic distance and prove that it matches the true Riemannian distance with third-order accuracy. Building on this approximation, we design a local planner that traces the manifold using first-order retractions guided by Riemannian natural gradients. Experiments on a two-link planar arm and a 7-DoF Franka manipulator under a kinetic-energy metric, as well as on rigid-body planning in $\mathrm{SE}(2)$ with non-holonomic motion constraints, demonstrate that our approach consistently produces lower-cost trajectories than Euclidean-based planners and classical numerical geodesic-solver baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.00993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models increasingly benefit from large vision--language models for semantic understanding, yet ensuring safe and accurate operation under long-tail conditions remains challenging. These challenges are particularly prominent in long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios, where autonomous vehicles must interact with heterogeneous road users, including human-driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper proposes HERMES, a holistic risk-aware end-to-end multimodal driving framework designed to inject explicit long-tail risk cues into trajectory planning. HERMES employs a foundation-model-assisted annotation pipeline to produce structured Long-Tail Scene Context and Long-Tail Planning Context, capturing hazard-centric cues together with maneuver intent and safety preference, and uses these signals to guide end-to-end planning. HERMES further introduces a Tri-Modal Driving Module that fuses multi-view perception, historical motion cues, and semantic guidance, ensuring risk-aware accurate trajectory planning under long-tail scenarios. Experiments on the real-world long-tail dataset demonstrate that HERMES consistently outperforms representative end-to-end and VLM-driven baselines under long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios. Ablation studies verify the complementary contributions of key components.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01018v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hierarchical Imitation Learning is a powerful paradigm for acquiring complex robot behaviors from demonstrations. A central challenge, however, lies in discovering reusable skills from long-horizon, multi-task offline data, especially when the data lacks explicit rewards or subtask annotations. In this work, we introduce LOKI, a three-stage end-to-end learning framework designed for offline skill discovery and hierarchical imitation. The framework commences with a two-stage, weakly supervised skill discovery process: Stage one performs coarse, task-aware macro-segmentation by employing an alignment-enforced Vector Quantized VAE guided by weak task labels. Stage two then refines these segments at a micro-level using a self-supervised sequential model, followed by an iterative clustering process to consolidate skill boundaries. The third stage then leverages these precise boundaries to construct a hierarchical policy within an option-based framework-complete with a learned termination condition beta for explicit skill switching. LOKI achieves high success rates on the challenging D4RL Kitchen benchmark and outperforms standard HIL baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the discovered skills are semantically meaningful, aligning with human intuition, and exhibit compositionality by successfully sequencing them to solve a novel, unseen task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning adaptive visuomotor policies for embodied agents remains a formidable challenge, particularly when facing cross-embodiment variations such as diverse sensor configurations and dynamic properties. Conventional learning approaches often struggle to separate task-relevant features from domain-specific variations (e.g., lighting, field-of-view, and rotation), leading to poor sample efficiency and catastrophic failure in unseen environments. To bridge this gap, we propose ContrAstive Prompt Orchestration (CAPO), a novel approach for learning visuomotor policies that integrates contrastive prompt learning and adaptive prompt orchestration. For prompt learning, we devise a hybrid contrastive learning strategy that integrates visual, temporal action, and text objectives to establish a pool of learnable prompts, where each prompt induces a visual representation encapsulating fine-grained domain factors. Based on these learned prompts, we introduce an adaptive prompt orchestration mechanism that dynamically aggregates these prompts conditioned on current observations. This enables the agent to adaptively construct optimal state representations by identifying dominant domain factors instantaneously. Consequently, the policy optimization is effectively shielded from irrelevant interference, preventing the common issue of overfitting to source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Crucially, it exhibits superior zero-shot adaptation across unseen target domains characterized by drastic environmental (e.g., illumination) and physical shifts (e.g., field-of-view and rotation), validating its effectiveness as a viable solution for cross-embodiment visuomotor policy adaptation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Earthwork operations are facing an increasing demand, while workforce aging and skill loss create a pressing need for automation. ROS2-TMS for Construction, a Cyber-Physical System framework designed to coordinate construction machinery, has been proposed for autonomous operation; however, its reliance on manually designed Behavior Trees (BTs) limits scalability, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous machine cooperation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for task planning and BT generation. However, most existing approaches remain confined to simulations or simple manipulators, with relatively few applications demonstrated in real-world contexts, such as complex construction sites involving multiple machines. This paper proposes an LLM-based workflow for BT generation, introducing synchronization flags to enable safe and cooperative operation. The workflow consists of two steps: high-level planning, where the LLM generates synchronization flags, and BT generation using structured templates. Safety is ensured by planning with parameters stored in the system database. The proposed method is validated in simulation and further demonstrated through real-world experiments, highlighting its potential to advance automation in civil engineering.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01085v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work introduces an analytical approach for detecting and estimating external forces acting on deformable linear objects (DLOs) using only their observed shapes. In many robot-wire interaction tasks, contact occurs not at the end-effector but at other points along the robot's body. Such scenarios arise when robots manipulate wires indirectly (e.g., by nudging) or when wires act as passive obstacles in the environment. Accurately identifying these interactions is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory planning, helping to prevent wire damage, avoid restricted robot motions, and mitigate potential hazards. Existing approaches often rely on expensive external force-torque sensor or that contacts occur at the end-effector for accurate force estimation. Using wire shape information acquired from a depth camera and under the assumption that the wire is in or near its static equilibrium, our method estimates both the location and magnitude of external forces without additional prior knowledge. This is achieved by exploiting derived consistency conditions and solving a system of linear equations based on force-torque balance along the wire. The approach was validated through simulation, where it achieved high accuracy, and through real-world experiments, where accurate estimation was demonstrated in selected interaction scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Teleoperation of high-precision manipulation is con-strained by tight success tolerances and complex contact dy-namics, which make impending failures difficult for human operators to anticipate under partial observability. This paper proposes a value-guided, failure-aware framework for bimanual teleoperation that provides compliant haptic assistance while pre-serving continuous human authority. The framework is trained entirely from heterogeneous offline teleoperation data containing both successful and failed executions. Task feasibility is mod-eled as a conservative success score learned via Conservative Value Learning, yielding a risk-sensitive estimate that remains reliable under distribution shift. During online operation, the learned success score regulates the level of assistance, while a learned actor provides a corrective motion direction. Both are integrated through a joint-space impedance interface on the master side, yielding continuous guidance that steers the operator away from failure-prone actions without overriding intent. Experimental results on contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate improved task success rates and reduced operator workload compared to conventional teleoperation and shared-autonomy baselines, indicating that conservative value learning provides an effective mechanism for embedding failure awareness into bilateral teleoperation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01100v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation requires bridging the gap between high-level planning (System 2) and low-level control (System 1). Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often entangle these processes, performing redundant multimodal reasoning at every timestep, which leads to high latency and goal instability. To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a "Lock-and-Gated" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01115v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at modeling action distributions but are inference-inefficient, since recursively denoising from noise to policy requires many steps and heavy UNet backbones, which hinders deployment on resource-constrained robots. Flow matching alleviates the sampling burden by learning a one-step vector field, yet prior implementations still inherit large UNet-style architectures. In this work, we present KAN-We-Flow, a flow-matching policy that draws on recent advances in Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) from vision to build a lightweight and highly expressive backbone for 3D manipulation. Concretely, we introduce an RWKV-KAN block: an RWKV first performs efficient time/channel mixing to propagate task context, and a subsequent GroupKAN layer applies learnable spline-based, groupwise functional mappings to perform feature-wise nonlinear calibration of the action mapping on RWKV outputs. Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision. Without resorting to large UNets, our design reduces parameters by 86.8\%, maintains fast runtime, and achieves state-of-the-art success rates on Adroit, Meta-World, and DexArt benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Force sensing is essential for dexterous robot manipulation, but scaling force-aware policy learning is hindered by the heterogeneity of tactile sensors. Differences in sensing principles (e.g., optical vs. magnetic), form factors, and materials typically require sensor-specific data collection, calibration, and model training, thereby limiting generalisability. We propose UniForce, a novel unified tactile representation learning framework that learns a shared latent force space across diverse tactile sensors. UniForce reduces cross-sensor domain shift by jointly modeling inverse dynamics (image-to-force) and forward dynamics (force-to-image), constrained by force equilibrium and image reconstruction losses to produce force-grounded representations. To avoid reliance on expensive external force/torque (F/T) sensors, we exploit static equilibrium and collect force-paired data via direct sensor--object--sensor interactions, enabling cross-sensor alignment with contact force. The resulting universal tactile encoder can be plugged into downstream force-aware robot manipulation tasks with zero-shot transfer, without retraining or finetuning. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tactile sensors including GelSight, TacTip, and uSkin, demonstrate consistent improvements in force estimation over prior methods, and enable effective cross-sensor coordination in Vision-Tactile-Language-Action (VTLA) models for a robotic wiping task. Code and datasets will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01166v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models benefit from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but existing approaches incur high inference overhead and rely on discrete reasoning representations that mismatch continuous perception and control. We propose Latent Reasoning VLA (\textbf{LaRA-VLA}), a unified VLA framework that internalizes multi-modal CoT reasoning into continuous latent representations for embodied action. LaRA-VLA performs unified reasoning and prediction in latent space, eliminating explicit CoT generation at inference time and enabling efficient, action-oriented control. To realize latent embodied reasoning, we introduce a curriculum-based training paradigm that progressively transitions from explicit textual and visual CoT supervision to latent reasoning, and finally adapts latent reasoning dynamics to condition action generation. We construct two structured CoT datasets and evaluate LaRA-VLA on both simulation benchmarks and long-horizon real-robot manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that LaRA-VLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLA methods while reducing inference latency by up to 90\% compared to explicit CoT-based approaches, demonstrating latent reasoning as an effective and efficient paradigm for real-time embodied control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We address the problem of reactive motion planning for quadrotors operating in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer versatile applications in logistics, agriculture, and surveillance, yet controlling them requires expert knowledge for safety and feasibility. Traditional static methods limit adaptability, while Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language control but generate unsafe trajectories due to lacking physical grounding. This paper introduces SkySim, a ROS2-based simulation framework in Gazebo that decouples LLM high-level planning from low-level safety enforcement. Using Gemini 3.5 Pro, SkySim translates user commands (e.g., "Form a circle") into spatial waypoints, informed by real-time drone states. An Artificial Potential Field (APF) safety filter applies minimal adjustments for collision avoidance, kinematic limits, and geo-fencing, ensuring feasible execution at 20 Hz. Experiments with swarms of 3, 10, and 30 Crazyflie drones validate spatial reasoning accuracy (100% across tested geometric primitives), real-time collision prevention, and scalability. SkySim empowers non-experts to iteratively refine behaviors, bridging AI cognition with robotic safety for dynamic environments. Future work targets hardware integration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of active perception within autonomous navigation in complex, unknown environments. Revisiting the foundational principles of active perception, we introduce an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework in which a robot must not only reach a goal while avoiding obstacles, but also actively control its onboard camera to enhance situational awareness. The policy receives observations comprising the robot state, the current depth frame, and a particularly local geometry representation built from a short history of depth readings. To couple collision-free motion planning with information-driven active camera control, we augment the navigation reward with a voxel-based information metric. This enables an aerial robot to learn a robust policy that balances goal-directed motion with exploratory sensing. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our strategy achieves safer flight compared to using fixed, non-actuated camera baselines while also inducing intrinsic exploratory behaviors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Triphibious robots capable of multi-domain motion and cross-domain transitions are promising to handle complex tasks across diverse environments. However, existing designs primarily focus on dual-mode platforms, and some designs suffer from high mechanical complexity or low propulsion efficiency, which limits their application. In this paper, we propose a novel triphibious robot capable of aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic motion, by a minimalist design combining a quadcopter structure with two passive wheels, without extra actuators. To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions. Experimental results validate the robot's multi-domain motion and cross-mode transition capability, along with the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed propulsion system.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks, which are essential for robotic perception, often suffer from performance degradation when the visual distribution of the deployment environment differs from that of the source dataset on which they were trained. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01429v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents a mapless global navigation approach for outdoor applications. It combines the exploratory capacity of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate trajectories and the semantic segmentation capabilities of a lightweight visual language model (VLM) to select the trajectory to execute. Open-vocabulary segmentation is used to score and select the generated trajectories based on natural language, and a state-of-the-art local planner executes velocity commands. One of the key features of the proposed approach is its ability to generate a large variability of trajectories and to select them and navigate in real-time. The approach was validated through real-world outdoor navigation experiments, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robotic system designed to manage severe bleeding in emergency scenarios, including unique environments like space stations. The robot features a shape-adjustable "ring mechanism", transitioning from a circular to an elliptical configuration to adjust wound coverage across various anatomical regions. We developed various arms for this ring mechanism with varying flexibilities to improve adaptability when applied to non-extremities of the body (abdomen, back, neck, etc.). To apply equal and constant pressure across the wound, we developed an inflatable ring and airbag balloon that are compatible with this shape-changing ring mechanism. A series of experiments focused on evaluating various ring arm configurations to characterize their bending stiffness. Subsequent experiments measured the force exerted by the airbag balloon system using a digital scale. Despite its promising performance, certain limitations related to coverage area are identified. The shape-changing effect of the device is limited to scenarios involving partially inflated or deflated airbag balloons, and cannot fully conform to complex anatomical regions. Finally, the device was tested on casualty simulation kits, where it successfully demonstrated its ability to control simulated bleeding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable localization is crucial for navigation in forests, where GPS is often degraded and LiDAR measurements are repetitive, occluded, and structurally complex. These conditions weaken the assumptions of traditional urban-centric localization methods, which assume that consistent features arise from unique structural patterns, necessitating forest-centric solutions to achieve robustness in these environments. To address these challenges, we propose TreeLoc, a LiDAR-based global localization framework for forests that handles place recognition and 6-DoF pose estimation. We represent scenes using tree stems and their Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which are aligned to a common reference frame via their axes and summarized using the tree distribution histogram (TDH) for coarse matching, followed by fine matching with a 2D triangle descriptor. Finally, pose estimation is achieved through a two-step geometric verification. On diverse forest benchmarks, TreeLoc outperforms baselines, achieving precise localization. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. We also propose applications for long-term forest management using descriptors from a compact global tree database. TreeLoc is open-sourced for the robotics community at https://github.com/minwoo0611/TreeLoc.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying learned control policies on humanoid robots is challenging: policies that appear robust in simulation can execute confidently in out-of-distribution (OOD) states after Sim-to-Real transfer, leading to silent failures that risk hardware damage. Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While simulation is vital for optimizing robotic systems, the cost of modeling deformable terrain has long limited its use in full-vehicle studies of off-road autonomous mobility. For example, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often confined to single-wheel tests, which obscures coupled wheel-vehicle-controller interactions and prevents joint optimization of mechanical design and control. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework that co-designs rover wheel geometry and steering controller parameters using high-fidelity, full-vehicle closed-loop simulations on deformable terrain. Using the efficiency and scalability of a continuum-representation model (CRM) for terramechanics, we evaluate candidate designs on trajectories of varying complexity while towing a fixed load. The optimizer tunes wheel parameters (radius, width, and grouser features) and steering PID gains under a multi-objective formulation that balances traversal speed, tracking error, and energy consumption. We compare two strategies: simultaneous co-optimization of wheel and controller parameters versus a sequential approach that decouples mechanical and control design. We analyze trade-offs in performance and computational cost. Across 3,000 full-vehicle simulations, campaigns finish in five to nine days, versus months with the group's earlier DEM-based workflow. Finally, a preliminary hardware study suggests the simulation-optimized wheel designs preserve relative performance trends on the physical rover. Together, these results show that scalable, high-fidelity simulation can enable practical co-optimization of wheel design and control for off-road vehicles on deformable terrain without relying on prohibitively expensive DEM studies. The simulation infrastructure (scripts and models) is released as open source in a public repository to support reproducibility and further research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving reliable and efficient planning in complex driving environments requires a model that can reason over the scene's geometry, appearance, and dynamics. We present UniDWM, a unified driving world model that advances autonomous driving through multifaceted representation learning. UniDWM constructs a structure- and dynamic-aware latent world representation that serves as a physically grounded state space, enabling consistent reasoning across perception, prediction, and planning. Specifically, a joint reconstruction pathway learns to recover the scene's structure, including geometry and visual texture, while a collaborative generation framework leverages a conditional diffusion transformer to forecast future world evolution within the latent space. Furthermore, we show that our UniDWM can be deemed as a variation of VAE, which provides theoretical guidance for the multifaceted representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniDWM in trajectory planning, 4D reconstruction and generation, highlighting the potential of multifaceted world representations as a foundation for unified driving intelligence. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Say2L/UniDWM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01632v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retargeting human motion to robot poses is a practical approach for teleoperating bimanual humanoid robot arms, but existing methods can be suboptimal and slow, often causing undesirable motion or latency. This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated generalizable open-vocabulary perception and reasoning, yet their real-robot manipulation capability remains unclear for long-horizon, closed-loop execution in unstructured, in-the-wild environments. Prior VLM-based manipulation pipelines are difficult to compare across different research groups' setups, and many evaluations rely on simulation, privileged state, or specially designed setups. We present AgenticLab, a model-agnostic robot agent platform and benchmark for open-world manipulation. AgenticLab provides a closed-loop agent pipeline for perception, task decomposition, online verification, and replanning. Using AgenticLab, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLM-based agents on real-robot tasks in unstructured environments. Our benchmark reveals several failure modes that offline vision-language tests (e.g., VQA and static image understanding) fail to capture, including breakdowns in multi-step grounding consistency, object grounding under occlusion and scene changes, and insufficient spatial reasoning for reliable manipulation. We will release the full hardware and software stack to support reproducible evaluation and accelerate research on general-purpose robot agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) department is responsible for cleaning, disinfecting, inspecting, and assembling surgical instruments between surgeries. Manual inspection and preparation of instrument trays is a time-consuming, error-prone task, often prone to contamination and instrument breakage. In this work, we present a fully automated robotic system that sorts and structurally packs surgical instruments into sterile trays, focusing on automation of the SPD assembly stage. A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification. The system integrates a calibrated vision module, a 6-DOF Staubli TX2-60L robotic arm with a custom dual electromagnetic gripper, and a rule-based packing algorithm that reduces instrument collisions during transport. The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport. Experimental evaluations show high perception accuracy and statistically significant reduction in tool-to-tool collisions compared to human-assembled trays. This work serves as the scalable first step toward automating SPD workflows, improving safety, and consistency of surgical preparation while reducing SPD processing times.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite rapid progress, embodied agents still struggle with long-horizon manipulation that requires maintaining spatial consistency, causal dependencies, and goal constraints. A key limitation of existing approaches is that task reasoning is implicitly embedded in high-dimensional latent representations, making it challenging to separate task structure from perceptual variability. We introduce Grounded Scene-graph Reasoning (GSR), a structured reasoning paradigm that explicitly models world-state evolution as transitions over semantically grounded scene graphs. By reasoning step-wise over object states and spatial relations, rather than directly mapping perception to actions, GSR enables explicit reasoning about action preconditions, consequences, and goal satisfaction in a physically grounded space. To support learning such reasoning, we construct Manip-Cognition-1.6M, a large-scale dataset that jointly supervises world understanding, action planning, and goal interpretation. Extensive evaluations across RLBench, LIBERO, GSR-benchmark, and real-world robotic tasks show that GSR significantly improves zero-shot generalization and long-horizon task completion over prompting-based baselines. These results highlight explicit world-state representations as a key inductive bias for scalable embodied reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01700v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we present Tilt-Ropter, a novel hybrid aerial-terrestrial vehicle (HATV) that combines tilt rotors with passive wheels to achieve energy-efficient multi-mode locomotion. Unlike existing under-actuated HATVs, the fully actuated design of Tilt-Ropter enables decoupled force and torque control, greatly enhancing its mobility and environmental adaptability. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is developed to track reference trajectories and handle contact constraints across locomotion modes, while a dedicated control allocation module exploits actuation redundancy to achieve energy-efficient control of actuators. Additionally, to enhance robustness during ground contact, we introduce an external wrench estimation algorithm that estimates environmental interaction forces and torques in real time. The system is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including seamless air-ground transitions and trajectory tracking. Results show low tracking errors in both modes and highlight a 92.8% reduction in power consumption during ground locomotion, demonstrating the system's potential for long-duration missions across large-scale and energy-constrained environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01731v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation using onboard sensing presents a fundamental challenge: the manipulated object occludes the sensor's field of view, creating occluded regions that can lead to collisions. We propose CURA-PPO, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses this challenge by explicitly modeling uncertainty under partial observability. By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions. Our method provides a practical solution for autonomous manipulation in cluttered environments using only onboard sensing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as an effective approach for bootstrapping sequential decision-making in robotics, achieving strong performance even in high-dimensional dexterous manipulation tasks. Recent behavior cloning methods further leverage expressive generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching, to represent multimodal action distributions. However, policies pretrained in this manner often exhibit limited generalization and require additional fine-tuning to achieve robust performance at deployment time. Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors.We propose \emph{Residual Flow Steering} (RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies. RFS steers a pretrained flow-matching policy by jointly optimizing a residual action and a latent noise distribution, enabling complementary forms of exploration: local refinement through residual corrections and global exploration through latent-space modulation. This design allows efficient adaptation while retaining the expressive structure of the pretrained policy.We demonstrate the effectiveness of RFS on dexterous manipulation tasks, showing efficient fine-tuning both in simulation and in real-world settings when adapting pretrained base policies.Project website:https://weirdlabuw.github.io/rfs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01811v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While vision-language-action (VLA) models for embodied agents integrate perception, reasoning, and control, they remain constrained by two critical weaknesses: first, during grasping tasks, the action tokens generated by the language model often exhibit subtle spatial deviations from the target object, resulting in grasp failures; second, they lack the ability to reliably recognize task completion, which leads to redundant actions and frequent timeout errors. To address these challenges and enhance robustness, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework, VLA-SCT. This framework operates as a self-correcting control loop, combining data-driven action refinement with conditional logic for termination. Consequently, compared to baseline approaches, our method achieves consistent improvements across all datasets in the LIBERO benchmark, significantly increasing the success rate of fine manipulation tasks and ensuring accurate task completion, thereby promoting the deployment of more reliable VLA agents in complex, unstructured environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models close the perception action loop by translating multimodal instructions into executable behaviors, but this very capability magnifies safety risks: jailbreaks that merely yield toxic text in LLMs can trigger unsafe physical actions in embodied systems. Existing defenses alignment, filtering, or prompt hardening intervene too late or at the wrong modality, leaving fused representations exploitable. We introduce a concept-based dictionary learning framework for inference-time safety control. By constructing sparse, interpretable dictionaries from hidden activations, our method identifies harmful concept directions and applies threshold-based interventions to suppress or block unsafe activations. Experiments on Libero-Harm, BadRobot, RoboPair, and IS-Bench show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, cutting attack success rates by over 70\% while maintaining task success. Crucially, the framework is plug-in and model-agnostic, requiring no retraining and integrating seamlessly with diverse VLAs. To our knowledge, this is the first inference-time concept-based safety method for embodied systems, advancing both interpretability and safe deployment of VLA models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01860v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fast flights with aggressive maneuvers in cluttered GNSS-denied environments require fast, reliable, and accurate UAV state estimation. In this paper, we present an approach for onboard state estimation of a high-speed UAV using a monocular RGB camera and an IMU. Our approach fuses data from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), an onboard landmark-based camera measurement system, and an IMU to produce an accurate state estimate. Using onboard measurement data, we estimate and compensate for VIO drift through a novel mathematical drift model. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on more complex hardware (e.g., stereo cameras or rangefinders) and use uncorrected drifting VIO velocities, orientation, and angular rates, leading to errors during fast maneuvers. In contrast, our method corrects all VIO states (position, orientation, linear and angular velocity), resulting in accurate state estimation even during rapid and dynamic motion. Our approach was thoroughly validated through 1600 simulations and numerous real-world experiments. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method in the A2RL Drone Racing Challenge 2025, where our team advanced to the final four out of 210 teams and earned a medal.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01870v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in robot learning increasingly rely on LLM-based task planning, leveraging their ability to bridge natural language with executable actions. While prior works showcased great performances, the widespread adoption of these models in robotics has been challenging as 1) existing methods are often closed-source or computationally intensive, neglecting the actual deployment on real-world physical systems, and 2) there is no universally accepted, plug-and-play representation for robotic task generation. Addressing these challenges, we propose BTGenBot-2, a 1B-parameter open-source small language model that directly converts natural language task descriptions and a list of robot action primitives into executable behavior trees in XML. Unlike prior approaches, BTGenBot-2 enables zero-shot BT generation, error recovery at inference and runtime, while remaining lightweight enough for resource-constrained robots. We further introduce the first standardized benchmark for LLM-based BT generation, covering 52 navigation and manipulation tasks in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that BTGenBot-2 consistently outperforms GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and larger open-source models across both functional and non-functional metrics, achieving average success rates of 90.38% in zero-shot and 98.07% in one-shot, while delivering up to 16x faster inference compared to the previous BTGenBot.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01880v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models can support real-time context- and value-aware decision-making. To do so, we combine the GPT-4o language model with a TurtleBot 4 platform simulating a smart vacuum cleaning robot in a home. The model evaluates the environment through vision input and determines whether it is appropriate to initiate cleaning. The system highlights the ability of these models to reason about domestic activities, social norms, and user preferences and take nuanced decisions aligned with the values of the people involved, such as cleanliness, comfort, and safety. We demonstrate the system in a realistic home environment, showing its ability to infer context and values from limited visual input. Our results highlight the promise of multimodal large language models in enhancing robotic autonomy and situational awareness, while also underscoring challenges related to consistency, bias, and real-time performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of a path-tracking framework for autonomous vehicles in which the lateral control command is applied to a dynamic control point along the wheelbase. Instead of enforcing a fixed reference at either the front or rear axle, the proposed method continuously interpolates between both, enabling smooth adaptation across driving contexts, including low-speed maneuvers and reverse motion. The lateral steering command is obtained by barycentric blending of two complementary controllers: a front-axle Stanley formulation and a rear-axle curvature-based geometric controller, yielding continuous transitions in steering behavior and improved tracking stability. In addition, we introduce a curvature-aware longitudinal control strategy based on virtual track borders and ray-tracing, which converts upcoming geometric constraints into a virtual obstacle distance and regulates speed accordingly. The complete approach is implemented in a unified control stack and validated in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle equipped with GPS-RTK, radar, odometry, and IMU. The results in closed-loop tracking and backward maneuvers show improved trajectory accuracy, smoother steering profiles, and increased adaptability compared to fixed control-point baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-task problem solving has been shown to improve the accuracy of the individual tasks, which is an important feature for robots, as they have a limited resource. However, when the number of labels for each task is not equal, namely imbalanced data exist, a problem may arise due to insufficient number of samples, and labeling is not very easy for mobile robots in every environment. We propose a method that can learn tasks even in the absence of the ground truth labels for some of the tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method. An interesting finding is related to the interaction of the tasks. We show a methodology to find out which tasks can improve the performance of other tasks. We investigate this by training the teacher network with the task outputs such as depth as inputs. We further provide empirical evidence when trained with a small amount of data. We use semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks on different datasets, NYUDv2 and Cityscapes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01916v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the foundation of closed-loop training and evaluation in autonomous driving, traffic simulation still faces two fundamental challenges: covariate shift introduced by open-loop imitation learning and limited capacity to reflect the multimodal behaviors observed in real-world traffic. Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01930v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic maps allow a robot to reason about its surroundings to fulfill tasks such as navigating known environments, finding specific objects, and exploring unmapped areas. Traditional mapping approaches provide accurate geometric representations but are often constrained by pre-designed symbolic vocabularies. The reliance on fixed object classes makes it impractical to handle out-of-distribution knowledge not defined at design time. Recent advances in Vision-Language Foundation Models, such as CLIP, enable open-set mapping, where objects are encoded as high-dimensional embeddings rather than fixed labels. In LIEREx, we integrate these VLFMs with established 3D Semantic Scene Graphs to enable target-directed exploration by an autonomous agent in partially unknown environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01939v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, active vision has reemerged as an important concept for manipulation, since visual occlusion occurs more frequently when main cameras are mounted on the robot heads. We reflect on the visual occlusion issue and identify its essence as the absence of information useful for task completion. Inspired by this, we come up with the more fundamental problem of Exploratory and Focused Manipulation (EFM). The proposed problem is about actively collecting information to complete challenging manipulation tasks that require exploration or focus. As an initial attempt to address this problem, we establish the EFM-10 benchmark that consists of 4 categories of tasks that align with our definition (10 tasks in total). We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating. Based on this idea, we collect a dataset named BAPData for the tasks in EFM-10. With the dataset, we successfully verify the effectiveness of the BAP strategy in an imitation learning manner. We hope that the EFM-10 benchmark along with the BAP strategy can become a cornerstone that facilitates future research towards this direction. Project website: EFManipulation.github.io.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.01948v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Macro-micro manipulators combine a macro manipulator with a large workspace, such as an industrial robot, with a lightweight, high-bandwidth micro manipulator. This enables highly dynamic interaction control while preserving the wide workspace of the robot. Traditionally, position control is assigned to the macro manipulator, while the micro manipulator handles the interaction with the environment, limiting the achievable interaction control bandwidth. To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control. Further we propose surrogate models for a more efficient controller design and easy adaptation to hardware changes. We validate our approach by comparing it against the other control schemes in different experiments, like collision with an object, following a force trajectory and industrial assembly tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precise localization with respect to a set of objects of interest enables mobile robots to perform various tasks. With the rise of edge devices capable of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) for real-time inference, it stands to reason to use artificial intelligence (AI) for the extraction of object-specific, semantic information from raw image data, such as the object class and the relative six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose. However, fusing such AI-based measurements in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) requires quantifying the DNNs' uncertainty and outlier rejection capabilities.   This paper presents the benefits of reformulating the measurement equation in AI-based, object-relative state estimation. By deriving an EKF using the direct object-relative pose measurement, we can decouple the position and rotation measurements, thus limiting the influence of erroneous rotation measurements and allowing partial measurement rejection. Furthermore, we investigate the performance and consistency improvements for state estimators provided by replacing the fixed measurement covariance matrix of the 6-DoF object-relative pose measurements with the predicted aleatoric uncertainty of the DNN.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02026v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for gentle robotic grasping that synergistically couples real-time friction estimation with adaptive grasp control. We propose a new particle filter-based method for real-time estimation of the friction coefficient using vision-based tactile sensors. This estimate is seamlessly integrated into a reactive controller that dynamically modulates grasp force to maintain a stable grip. The two processes operate synchronously in a closed-loop: the controller uses the current best estimate to adjust the force, while new tactile feedback from this action continuously refines the estimation. This creates a highly responsive and robust sensorimotor cycle. The reliability and efficiency of the complete framework are validated through extensive robotic experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately handling contact with friction remains a core bottleneck for Material Point Method (MPM), from reliable contact point detection to enforcing frictional contact laws (non-penetration, Coulomb friction, and maximum dissipation principle). In this paper, we introduce a frictional-contact pipeline for implicit MPM that is both precise and robust. During the collision detection phase, contact points are localized with particle-centric geometric primitives; during the contact resolution phase, we cast frictional contact as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) over contact impulses and solve it with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Crucially, the formulation reuses the same implicit MPM linearization, yielding efficiency and numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly into the implicit MPM loop and is agnostic to modeling choices, including material laws, interpolation functions, and transfer schemes. We evaluate it across seven representative scenes that span elastic and elasto-plastic responses, simple and complex deformable geometries, and a wide range of contact conditions. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate contact localization, reliable frictional handling, and broad generality, making it a practical solution for MPM-based simulations in robotics and related domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02142v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Force sensing is a crucial modality for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, as it enables fine-grained perception and dexterous manipulation in contact-rich tasks. We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02181v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Powered prostheses are capable of providing net positive work to amputees and have advanced in the past two decades. However, reducing amputee metabolic cost of walking remains an open problem. The Law of Intersegmental Coordination (ISC) has been observed across gaits and has been previously implicated in energy expenditure of walking, yet it has rarely been analyzed or applied within the context of lower-limb amputee gait. This law states that the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot over the gait cycle are not independent. In this work, we developed a method to analyze intersegmental coordination for lower-limb 3D kinematic data, to simplify ISC analysis. Moreover, inspired by motor control, biomechanics and robotics literature, we used our method to broaden ISC toward a new law of coordination of moments. We find these Elevation Space Moments (ESM), and present results showing a moment-based coordination for able bodied gait. We also analyzed ISC for amputee gait walking with powered and passive prosthesis, and found that while elevation angles remained planar, the ESM showed less coordination. We use ISC as a constraint to predict the shank angles/moments that would compensate for alterations due to a passive foot so as to mimic a healthy thigh angle/moment profile. This may have implications for improving powered prosthetic control. We developed the ISC3d toolbox that is freely available online, which may be used to compute kinematic and kinetic ISC in 3D. This provides a means to further study the role of coordination in gait and may help address fundamental questions of the neural control of human movement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02269v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present $multipanda\_ros2$, a novel open-source ROS2 architecture for multi-robot control of Franka Robotics robots. Leveraging ros2 control, this framework provides native ROS2 interfaces for controlling any number of robots from a single process. Our core contributions address key challenges in real-time torque control, including interaction control and robot-environment modeling. A central focus of this work is sustaining a 1kHz control frequency, a necessity for real-time control and a minimum frequency required by safety standards. Moreover, we introduce a controllet-feature design pattern that enables controller-switching delays of $\le 2$ ms, facilitating reproducible benchmarking and complex multi-robot interaction scenarios. To bridge the simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap, we integrate a high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation with quantitative metrics for both kinematic accuracy and dynamic consistency (torques, forces, and control errors). Furthermore, we demonstrate that real-world inertial parameter identification can significantly improve force and torque accuracy, providing a methodology for iterative physics refinement. Our work extends approaches from soft robotics to rigid dual-arm, contact-rich tasks, showcasing a promising method to reduce the sim2real gap and providing a robust, reproducible platform for advanced robotics research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving highly dynamic humanoid parkour on unseen, complex terrains remains a challenge in robotics. Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Task generation for underwater multi-robot inspections without prior knowledge of existing geometry can be achieved and optimized through examination of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) data. By considering hardware parameters and environmental conditions, a set of tasks is generated from SLAM meshes and optimized through expected keypoint scores and distance-based pruning. In-water tests are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and determine the appropriate parameters. These results are compared to simulated Voronoi partitions and boustrophedon patterns for inspection coverage on a model of the test environment. The key benefits of the presented task discovery method include adaptability to unexpected geometry and distributions that maintain coverage while focusing on areas more likely to present defects or damage.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02396v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic imitation learning typically requires models that capture multimodal action distributions while operating at real-time control rates and accommodating multiple sensing modalities. Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02402v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulating deformable objects under rich interactions remains a fundamental challenge for real-to-sim robot manipulation, with dynamics jointly driven by environmental effects and robot actions. Existing simulators rely on predefined physics or data-driven dynamics without robot-conditioned control, limiting accuracy, stability, and generalization. This paper presents SoMA, a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator for soft-body manipulation. SoMA couples deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot joint actions in a unified latent neural space for end-to-end real-to-sim simulation. Modeling interactions over learned Gaussian splats enables controllable, stable long-horizon manipulation and generalization beyond observed trajectories without predefined physical models. SoMA improves resimulation accuracy and generalization on real-world robot manipulation by 20%, enabling stable simulation of complex tasks such as long-horizon cloth folding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02411v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object rearrangement planning in complex, cluttered environments is a common challenge in warehouses, households, and rescue sites. Prior studies largely address monotone instances, whereas real-world tasks are often non-monotone-objects block one another and must be temporarily relocated to intermediate positions before reaching their final goals. In such settings, effective multi-agent collaboration can substantially reduce the time required to complete tasks. This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world multi-agent system under different configurations, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decentralized Collaborative Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (C-SLAM) techniques often struggle to identify map overlaps due to significant viewpoint variations among robots. Motivated by recent advancements in 3D foundation models, which can register images despite large viewpoint differences, we propose a robust loop closing approach that leverages these models to establish inter-robot measurements. In contrast to resource-intensive methods requiring full 3D reconstruction within a centralized map, our approach integrates foundation models into existing SLAM pipelines, yielding scalable and robust multi-robot mapping. Our contributions include: (1) integrating 3D foundation models to reliably estimate relative poses from monocular image pairs within decentralized C-SLAM; (2) introducing robust outlier mitigation techniques critical to the use of these relative poses; and (3) developing specialized pose graph optimization formulations that efficiently resolve scale ambiguities. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating improvements in localization and mapping accuracy, alongside significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. These results highlight the potential of our approach for deployment in large-scale multi-robot scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robot learning from interacting with the physical world is fundamentally bottlenecked by the cost of physical interaction. The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Representing and understanding 3D environments in a structured manner is crucial for autonomous agents to navigate and reason about their surroundings. While traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generate metric reconstructions and can be extended to metric-semantic mapping, they lack a higher level of abstraction and relational reasoning. To address this gap, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful representation for capturing hierarchical structures and object relationships. In this work, we propose an enhanced hierarchical 3D scene graph that integrates open-vocabulary features across multiple abstraction levels and supports object-relational reasoning. Our approach leverages a Vision Language Model (VLM) to infer semantic relationships. Notably, we introduce a task reasoning module that combines Large Language Models (LLM) and a VLM to interpret the scene graph's semantic and relational information, enabling agents to reason about tasks and interact with their environment more intelligently. We validate our method by deploying it on a quadruped robot in multiple environments and tasks, highlighting its ability to reason about them.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02459v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to perform agile and adaptive interactive tasks has long been a core challenge in robotics. Current approaches are bottlenecked by either the scarcity of realistic interaction data or the need for meticulous, task-specific reward engineering, which limits their scalability. To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration. Our experiments show that HumanX achieves over 8 times higher generalization success than prior methods, demonstrating a scalable and task-agnostic pathway for learning versatile, real-world robot interactive skills.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.02481v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Likelihood-based policy gradient methods are the dominant approach for training robot control policies from rewards. These methods rely on differentiable action likelihoods, which constrain policy outputs to simple distributions like Gaussians. In this work, we show how flow matching policy gradients -- a recent framework that bypasses likelihood computation -- can be made effective for training and fine-tuning more expressive policies in challenging robot control settings. We introduce an improved objective that enables success in legged locomotion, humanoid motion tracking, and manipulation tasks, as well as robust sim-to-real transfer on two humanoid robots. We then present ablations and analysis on training dynamics. Results show how policies can exploit the flow representation for exploration when training from scratch, as well as improved fine-tuning robustness over baselines.
