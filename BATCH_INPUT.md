- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03878v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03881v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03882v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03890v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03893v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03894v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03895v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.

To address this, we introduce HY3D-Bench, an open-source ecosystem designed to establish a unified, high-quality foundation for 3D generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We curate a library of 250k high-fidelity 3D objects distilled from large-scale repositories, employing a rigorous pipeline to deliver training-ready artifacts, including watertight meshes and multi-view renderings; (2) We introduce structured part-level decomposition, providing the granularity essential for fine-grained perception and controllable editing; and (3) We bridge real-world distribution gaps via a scalable AIGC synthesis pipeline, contributing 125k synthetic assets to enhance diversity in long-tail categories. Validated empirically through the training of Hunyuan3D-2.1-Small, HY3D-Bench democratizes access to robust data resources, aiming to catalyze innovation across 3D perception, robotics, and digital content creation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03916v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03918v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04030v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04044v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&amp;E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04053v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04063v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&amp;E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $\kappa$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04094v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04102v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we focus on boosting the feature extraction to improve the performance of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in endoscopy videos. We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04142v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jri-advtechlab/jsynflow.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04154v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04162v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to attention for vision tasks, offering lineartime sequence processing with competitive accuracy. Vision SSMs, however, require serializing 2D images into 1D token sequences along a predefined scan order, a factor often overlooked. We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%. These results highlight scan-order design, together with channel filtering, as a crucial, underexplored factor for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs. Code will be released upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04184v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04193v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04227v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.   In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.   To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04252v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04257v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.   To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.   Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04300v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination. The dataset and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/Light-Up-Your-Face.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04317v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04337v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04343v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing. We report competitive and state-of-the-art results on various datasets and perception tasks of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. https://github.com/DLR-RM/nemo

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04349v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04361v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04405v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency. The code and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/LCUDiff.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04416v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04517v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04525v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04547v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Radiological analysis increasingly benefits from pretrained visual representations that can support heterogeneous downstream tasks across imaging modalities. In this work, we introduce OmniRad, a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images, designed with radiology-inspired principles emphasizing representation reuse and cross-task transferability. We evaluate the pretrained encoder under multiple downstream adaptation regimes, including lightweight task-specific adapters with a frozen backbone as well as full end-to-end fine-tuning for classification, allowing us to assess both representation quality and task-specific performance. OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations. Qualitative analyses and latent-space visualizations suggest improved feature clustering and modality-related separation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04549v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04565v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04583v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

Images were extracted from high-definition videos recorded under controlled conditions and curated to reduce redundancy using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) filtering. An automated face-anonymization step was applied to all videos prior to frame selection. Each image contains polygon annotations for five medically relevant classes: syringe, rubber band, disinfectant wipe, gloves, and training arm. The annotations were exported in a segmentation format compatible with modern object detection frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8), ensuring broad usability. This dataset is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets and is designed to advance research in medical training automation and human-object interaction. It enables multiple applications, including phlebotomy tool detection, procedural step recognition, workflow analysis, conformance checking, and the development of educational systems that provide structured feedback to medical trainees. The data and accompanying label files are publicly available on Zenodo.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04657v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04672v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04692v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04699v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04712v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04802v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at https://github.com/QingAnLiu/VISTA-Bench.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04819v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04873v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04876v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03876v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03906v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.   We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03911v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03912v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for univariate time series forecasting using a subset of the M4 Forecasting Competition dataset. Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03914v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper tackles a critical bottleneck in Super-Structure-based divide-and-conquer causal discovery: the high computational cost of constructing accurate Super-Structures--particularly when conditional independence (CI) tests are expensive and domain knowledge is unavailable. We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03921v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable sparse expert activation, meaning that only a subset of the model's parameters is used during each inference. However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03922v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard sequence mixing layers used in language models struggle to balance efficiency and performance. Self-attention performs well on long context tasks but has expensive quadratic compute and linear memory costs, while linear attention and SSMs use only linear compute and constant memory but struggle with long context processing. In this paper, we develop a sequence mixing layer that aims to find a better compromise between memory-compute costs and long-context processing, which we call online vector-quantized (OVQ) attention. OVQ-attention requires linear compute costs and constant memory, but, unlike linear attention and SSMs, it uses a sparse memory update that allows it to greatly increase the size of its memory state and, consequently, memory capacity. We develop a theoretical basis for OVQ-attention based on Gaussian mixture regression, and we test it on a variety of synthetic long context tasks and on long context language modeling. OVQ-attention shows significant improvements over linear attention baselines and the original VQ-attention, on which OVQ-attention was inspired. It demonstrates competitive, and sometimes identical, performance to strong self-attention baselines up 64k sequence length, despite using a small fraction of the memory of full self-attention.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Affordable housing shortages affect billions, while land scarcity and regulations make site selection slow. We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03945v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tabular learning is still dominated by row-wise predictors that score each row independently, which fits i.i.d. benchmarks but fails on transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on other rows. We show that row-wise prediction rules out natural targets driven by global counts, overlaps, and relational patterns. To make "using structure" precise across architectures, we introduce grables: a modular interface that separates how a table is lifted to a graph (constructor) from how predictions are computed on that graph (node predictor), pinpointing where expressive power comes from. Experiments on synthetic tasks, transaction data, and a RelBench clinical-trials dataset confirm the predicted separations: message passing captures inter-row dependencies that row-local models miss, and hybrid approaches that explicitly extract inter-row structure and feed it to strong tabular learners yield consistent gains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The predictive machine learning models for child mortality tend to be inaccurate when applied to future populations, since they suffer from look-ahead bias due to the randomization used in cross-validation. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall "Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient," with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03967v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful and popular dimensionality reduction technique. However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots. The code can be found on GitHub.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Credit exposure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is often implicit and token-mediated, creating a dense web of inter-protocol dependencies. Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the effect of group symmetrization of pre-trained models on conformal prediction (CP), a post-hoc, distribution-free, finite-sample method of uncertainty quantification that offers formal coverage guarantees under the assumption of data exchangeability. Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels. We then propose an experimental design to test these theoretical claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03994v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is widely assumed to expose a model's reasoning process and improve transparency. We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks typically treat nonlinearities as fixed primitives (e.g., ReLU), limiting both interpretability and the granularity of control over the induced function class. While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Pad\'e-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, the cost of full-parameter fine-tuning has made parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the default strategy for downstream adaptation. Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning approach for high-content perturbation data where samples across modalities are weakly paired through shared perturbation labels but lack direct correspondence. Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents a consensus-based Bayesian framework to detect malicious user behavior in enterprise directory access graphs. By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors. Simulations over synthetic access graphs validate our method, demonstrating its sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04031v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tabular Language Models (TLMs) have been claimed to achieve emergent generalization for tabular prediction. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of Tabula-8B as a representative TLM, utilizing 165 datasets from the UniPredict benchmark. Our investigation reveals three findings. First, binary and categorical classification achieve near-zero median lift over majority-class baselines and strong aggregate performance is driven entirely by quartile classification tasks. Second, top-performing datasets exhibit pervasive contamination, including complete train-test overlap and task-level leakage that evades standard deduplication. Third, instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers 92.2% of standard classification performance and on quartile classification, format familiarity closes 71.3% of the gap with the residual attributable to contaminated datasets. These findings suggest claimed generalization likely reflects evaluation artifacts rather than learned tabular reasoning. We conclude with recommendations for strengthening TLM evaluation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04037v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning domain adaptive policies that can generalize to unseen transition dynamics, remains a fundamental challenge in learning-based control. Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods. More visualization results are available on the https://outsider86.github.io/DomainAdaptiveDiffusionPolicy/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Partition Trees, a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation over general outcome spaces, supporting both continuous and categorical variables within a unified formulation. Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities. Empirically, we demonstrate improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests, along with robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04054v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding how neural representations respond to geometric transformations is essential for evaluating whether learned features preserve meaningful spatial structure. Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The calculation of shortest-path distances in road networks is a core operation in navigation systems, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.

As new work continues to appear after publication, surveys quickly become outdated, contributing to redundancy and fragmentation in the literature. We reframe survey writing as a long-horizon maintenance problem rather than a one-time generation task, treating surveys as living documents that evolve alongside the research they describe. We propose an agentic Dynamic Survey Framework that supports the continuous updating of existing survey papers by incrementally integrating new work while preserving survey structure and minimizing unnecessary disruption. Using a retrospective experimental setup, we demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively identifies and incorporates emerging research while preserving the coherence and structure of existing surveys.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04074v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04078v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deterministic neural operators perform well on many PDEs but can struggle with the approximation of high-frequency wave phenomena, where strong input-to-output sensitivity makes operator learning challenging, and spectral bias blurs oscillations. We argue for adopting a probabilistic approach for approximating waves in high-frequency regime, and develop our probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator. After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field. We envision that our results position probabilistic operator learning as a principled and effective approach for solving complex PDEs such as Helmholtz in the challenging high-frequency regime.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept-based models (CMs) enhance interpretability in deep learning by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines. Notably, F-CMs enable interpretable inference on concepts not available to a given institution, a key novelty with respect to existing approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04096v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) is hindered by context rigidity: tokens are retained based on transient high confidence, often ignoring that early predictions lack full context. This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04099v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic perspective on generalization in machine learning by framing the learning problem within the context of lossy compression and applying finite blocklength analysis. In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semi-dual neural optimal transport learns a transport map via a max-min objective, yet training can converge to incorrect or degenerate maps. We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. This provides a principled stopping rule: annealing below $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ can $\textit{worsen}$ optimization conditioning without improving statistical accuracy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04118v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research has shown that language models can learn to \textit{reason}, often via reinforcement learning. Some work even trains low-rank parameterizations for reasoning, but conventional LoRA cannot scale below the model dimension. We question whether even rank=1 LoRA is necessary for learning to reason and propose TinyLoRA, a method for scaling low-rank adapters to sizes as small as one parameter. Within our new parameterization, we are able to train the 8B parameter size of Qwen2.5 to 91\% accuracy on GSM8K with only 13 trained parameters in bf16 (26 total bytes). We find this trend holds in general: we are able to recover 90\% of performance improvements while training $1000x$ fewer parameters across a suite of more difficult learning-to-reason benchmarks such as AIME, AMC, and MATH500. Notably, we are only able to achieve such strong performance with RL: models trained using SFT require $100-1000x$ larger updates to reach the same performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The application of generative models for experimental drug discovery campaigns is severely limited by the difficulty of designing molecules de novo that can be synthesized in practice. Previous works have leveraged Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to impose hard synthesizability constraints through the design of state and action spaces based on predefined reaction templates and building blocks. Despite the promising prospects of this approach, it currently lacks flexibility and scalability. As an alternative, we propose S3-GFN, which generates synthesizable SMILES molecules via simple soft regularization of a sequence-based GFlowNet. Our approach leverages rich molecular priors learned from large-scale SMILES corpora to steer molecular generation towards high-reward, synthesizable chemical spaces. The model induces constraints through off-policy replay training with a contrastive learning signal based on separate buffers of synthesizable and unsynthesizable samples. Our experiments show that S3-GFN learns to generate synthesizable molecules ($\geq 95\%$) with higher rewards in diverse tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04131v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains for its ability to optimize risk-sensitive objectives. However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning discretization-invariant function-to-function mappings in scientific computing. However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains is critical for real-world applications, yet existing spatiotemporal models often suffer from performance degradation under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts. We address these challenges through the lens of structure-aware context selection. We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference is often bounded by memory footprint and memory bandwidth in resource-constrained deployments, making quantization a fundamental technique for efficient serving. While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04166v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Static sparse training is a promising route to efficient learning by committing to a fixed mask pattern, yet the constrained structure reduces robustness. Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have become a powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems in scientific and engineering domains. Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning the intrinsic dimensionality of subjective perceptual spaces such as taste, smell, or aesthetics from ordinal data is a challenging problem. We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, "Is A more similar to B than C?". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from sparse point-sensor measurements is a central challenge in learning parametric PDE dynamics. Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved tremendous success with their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet also face safety issues similar to those of basic language models. In particular, while algorithms are designed to guide them to deliberately refuse harmful prompts with safe reasoning, this process often fails to generalize against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks. In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, as formal guarantees often require solving non-convex problems. Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper aims to train a graph foundation model that is able to represent any graph as a vector preserving structural and semantic information useful for downstream graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph clustering. To learn the features of graphs from diverse domains while maintaining strong generalization ability to new domains, we propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method, which constructs weighted graphs using the attributes of all nodes in each dataset and then generates consistent node embeddings. To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation. We also provide a theoretical generalization bound to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results of few-shot graph classification and graph clustering show that our model outperforms strong baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04255v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In partial multi-label learning (PML), the true labels are unobserved, which makes label disambiguation important but difficult. A key challenge is that ambiguous candidate labels can propagate errors into downstream tasks such as feature engineering. To solve this issue, we jointly model the disambiguation and feature selection tasks as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to turn PML risk minimization into expected-return maximization. Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size. Experiments in multiple metrics and data sets verify the advantages of the framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Residual connections are the de facto standard for mitigating vanishing gradients, yet they impose structural constraints and fail to address the inherent inefficiencies of piecewise linear activations. We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04265v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it frequently encounters challenges such as entropy collapse, excessive verbosity, and insufficient exploration for hard problems. Crucially, existing reward schemes fail to distinguish between the need for extensive search during problem-solving and the efficiency required for mastered knowledge. In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes "thickening" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to "thinning", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04270v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Non Pneumatic tires offer a promising alternative to pneumatic tires. However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs. Overall, the proposed framework enables systematic development of high performance, next generation UPTIS spoke structures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose the Convolutional Operator Network for Forward and Inverse Problems (FI-Conv), a framework capable of predicting system evolution and estimating parameters in complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence. FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04291v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-expert systems, where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate to solve complex tasks, are increasingly adopted for high-performance reasoning and generation. However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04323v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures remains challenging: while spherical-harmonic equivariant models are expressive, their Clebsch-Gordan tensor products incur substantial compute and memory costs for higher-order targets. We propose the Cartesian Environment Interaction Tensor Network (CEITNet), an approach that constructs a multi-channel Cartesian local environment tensor for each atom and performs flexible many-body mixing via a learnable channel-space interaction. By performing learning in channel space and using Cartesian tensor bases to assemble equivariant outputs, CEITNet enables efficient construction of high-order tensor. Across benchmark datasets for order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensor prediction, CEITNet surpasses prior high-order prediction methods on key accuracy criteria while offering high computational efficiency.

We introduce \textit{RISE} (Residual Inspection through Sorted Evaluation), an interactive visualization tool that converts sorted residuals into interpretable patterns. By connecting residual curve structures to formal fairness notions, RISE enables localized disparity diagnosis, subgroup comparison across environments, and the detection of hidden fairness issues. Through post-hoc analysis, RISE exposes accuracy-fairness trade-offs that aggregate statistics miss, supporting more informed model selection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time scaling strategies have effectively leveraged inference-time compute to enhance the reasoning abilities of Autoregressive Large Language Models. In this work, we demonstrate that Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) are inherently amenable to advanced search strategies, owing to their iterative and non-autoregressive generation process. To leverage this, we propose UnMaskFork (UMF), a framework that formulates the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the generation path. In contrast to standard scaling methods relying on stochastic sampling, UMF explores the search space through deterministic partial unmasking actions performed by multiple MDLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that UMF consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines on complex coding benchmarks, while also exhibiting strong scalability on mathematical reasoning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear attention significantly reduces the computational complexity of Transformers from quadratic to linear, yet it consistently lags behind softmax-based attention in performance. We identify the root cause of this degradation as the non-negativity constraint imposed on kernel feature maps: standard projections like ReLU act as "passive truncation" operators, indiscriminately discarding semantic information residing in the negative domain. We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing. MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, demonstrating that strictly linear efficiency can be achieved without compromising representational fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative machine learning (ML) without a central server, making it suitable for settings where training data cannot be centrally hosted. We introduce Mosaic Learning, a DL framework that decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently across the network. Fragmentation reduces redundant communication across correlated parameters and enables more diverse information propagation without increasing communication cost. We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline. In summary, Mosaic Learning improves DL performance without sacrificing its utility or efficiency, and positions itself as a new DL standard.

We introduce CF-HyperGNNExplainer, a counterfactual explanation method for HGNNs that identifies the minimal structural changes required to alter a model's prediction. The method generates counterfactual hypergraphs using actionable edits limited to removing node-hyperedge incidences or deleting hyperedges, producing concise and structurally meaningful explanations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that CF-HyperGNNExplainer generates valid and concise counterfactuals, highlighting the higher-order relations most critical to HGNN decisions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04365v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works focus on synthesizing Chart Understanding (ChartU) training sets to inject advanced chart knowledge into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where the sufficiency of the knowledge is typically verified by quantifying capability gains via the fine-tune-then-evaluate paradigm. However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, there has been great success in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04373v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, "Common Ground", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04380v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Policy optimization methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants have achieved strong results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\pm$0.2 versus $\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste. However, data privacy concerns often hinder collaboration among retailers, limiting the potential for improved predictive accuracy. In this study, we explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), with a focus on the grocery retail sector dealing with perishable goods. We develop a baseline predictive model for demand forecasting and waste assessment in an isolated retailer scenario. Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used to support decision-making. To verify their reliability and adaptability, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of tools and methods for tasks such as NN code verification, refactoring, and migration. These tools play a crucial role in guaranteeing both the correctness and maintainability of neural network architectures, helping to prevent implementation errors, simplify model updates, and ensure that complex networks can be reliably extended and reused. Yet, assessing their effectiveness remains challenging due to the lack of publicly diverse datasets of neural networks that would allow systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a dataset of neural networks that can serve as a benchmark for validation. The dataset is designed to cover diverse architectural components and to handle multiple input data types and tasks. In total, 608 samples are generated, each conforming to a set of precise design choices. To further ensure their consistency, we validate the correctness of the generated networks using static analysis and symbolic tracing. We make the dataset publicly available to support the community in advancing research on neural network reliability and adaptability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04396v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Distributed training of foundation models via $\texttt{DDP}$ is limited by interconnect bandwidth. While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\approx 10 \times$. Finally, we show that $\texttt{LoRDO}$ improves performance even more in very low-memory settings with small rank/batch size.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04404v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04417v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&amp;A with search engines, including 29.7% $\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA. Overall, we show that EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and powerful approach to scaling RL for LLMs. Code: https://github.com/LunjunZhang/ema-pg

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04431v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but they also introduce significant safety risks when individual agents fail or behave adversarially. In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04436v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04447v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern chess language models are dense transformers trained on millions of games played by thousands of high-rated individuals. However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models introduce unique challenges for safety alignment due to their sparse routing mechanisms, which can enable degenerate optimization behaviors under standard full-parameter fine-tuning. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Our results suggest that robust MoE safety alignment benefits from targeted expert repair rather than global parameter updates, offering a practical and architecture-preserving alternative to prior approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04491v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention head pruning has emerged as an effective technique for transformer model compression, an increasingly important goal in the era of Green AI. However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Web is naturally heterogeneous with user devices, geographic regions, browsing patterns, and contexts all leading to highly diverse, unique datasets. Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets. This work advances the vision of scalable, privacy-preserving intelligence for real-world heterogeneous and distributed web systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04542v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge for neural networks when tasks are trained sequentially. In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04548v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes and derive explicit analytic solutions for gradient flow (GF) in large learning problems. Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics. We observe a very good agreement of our theoretical predictions with experiment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04555v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning from a stream of tasks usually pits plasticity against stability: acquiring new knowledge often causes catastrophic forgetting of past information. Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safe artificial intelligence for perception tasks remains a major challenge, partly due to the lack of data with high-quality labels. Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) provide a principled model for handling constraints, such as safety and other auxiliary objectives, in reinforcement learning. The common approach of using additive-cost constraints and dual variables often hinders off-policy scalability. We propose a Control as Inference formulation based on stochastic decision horizons, where constraint violations attenuate reward contributions and shorten the effective planning horizon via state-action-dependent continuation. This yields survival-weighted objectives that remain replay-compatible for off-policy actor-critic learning. We propose two violation semantics, absorbing and virtual termination, that share the same survival-weighted return but result in distinct optimization structures that lead to SAC/MPO-style policy improvement. Experiments demonstrate improved sample efficiency and favorable return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. Moreover, MPO with virtual termination (VT-MPO) scales effectively to our high-dimensional musculoskeletal Hyfydy setup.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hybrid models and Neural Differential Equations (NDE) are getting increasingly important for the modeling of physical systems, however they often encounter stability and accuracy issues during long-term integration. Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04620v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: GRPO-style reinforcement learning (RL)-based LLM fine-tuning algorithms have recently gained popularity. Relying on heuristic trust-region approximations, however, they can lead to brittle optimization behavior, as global importance-ratio clipping and group-wise normalization fail to regulate samples whose importance ratios fall outside the clipping range. We propose Query-Adaptive Trust-Region policy Optimization (QUATRO), which directly enforces trust-region constraints through a principled optimization. This yields a clear and interpretable objective that enables explicit control over policy updates and stable, entropy-controlled optimization, with a stabilizer terms arising intrinsically from the exact trust-region formulation. Empirically verified on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, QUATRO shows stable training under increased policy staleness and aggressive learning rates, maintaining well-controlled entropy throughout training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Protein inverse folding, the task of predicting amino acid sequences for desired structures, is pivotal for de novo protein design. However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a "single-pass" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions. Extensive experiments on CATH 4.2, TS50, and TS500 benchmarks demonstrate that our geometric framework is highly competitive, while RIGA-Fold* significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both sequence recovery and structural consistency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04643v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time series underpin modern critical infrastructure, making the prediction of anomalies a vital necessity for proactive risk mitigation. While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04651v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04669v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/BeyondMuon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transportation on graphs is a fundamental challenge across many domains, where decisions must respect topological and operational constraints. Despite the need for actionable policies, existing graph-transport methods lack this expressivity. They rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to generalize across sparse topologies, and scale poorly with graph size and time horizon. To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting in real-world applications requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04689v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-horizon time-series forecasting involves simultaneously making predictions for a consecutive sequence of subsequent time steps. This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cuffless blood pressure screening based on easily acquired photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a practical pathway toward scalable cardiovascular health assessment. Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards. Our results show that existing PPG-based BP estimation models lack clinical practicality under standardized conditions, while incorporating demographic information markedly improves their accuracy and physiological validity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04734v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04735v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04737v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04752v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the central role of attention heads in Transformers, we lack tools to understand why a model attends to a particular token. To address this, we study the query-key (QK) space -- the bilinear joint embedding space between queries and keys. We present a contrastive covariance method to decompose the QK space into low-rank, human-interpretable components. It is when features in keys and queries align in these low-rank subspaces that high attention scores are produced. We first study our method both analytically and empirically in a simplified setting. We then apply our method to large language models to identify human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic features and binding features. Finally, we demonstrate how attention scores can be attributed to our identified features.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04757v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04761v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04768v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.

Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04770v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04780v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04782v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With more wind farms clustered for integration, the short-term wind speed prediction of such wind farm clusters is critical for normal operation of power systems. This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We make the information transmitted by attention an explicit, measurable quantity in vision transformers. By inserting variational information bottlenecks on all attention-mediated writes to the residual stream -- without other architectural changes -- we train models with an explicit information cost and obtain a controllable spectrum from independent patch processing to fully expressive global attention. On ImageNet-100, we characterize how classification behavior and information routing evolve across this spectrum, and provide initial insights into how global visual representations emerge from local patch processing by analyzing the first attention heads that transmit information. By biasing learning toward solutions with constrained internal communication, our approach yields models that are more tractable for mechanistic analysis and more amenable to control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04809v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.

We also propose an approach based on multilingual node features with an improved asymmetric decoder for compatibility, which allows us to generalize and extend the prediction to more, geographically and linguistically disjoint, data from New Zealand. Our adaptations also improve inductive transferability between these disjoint legal systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04852v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04863v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.   We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) requires agents to learn from a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired policies. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04870v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models have transformed many applications but remain expensive to train. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04881v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03974v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03975v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time computation has become a primary driver of progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning, but it is increasingly bottlenecked by expensive verification. In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative. On the \textsc{MATH} benchmark, our approach achieves higher accuracy than best-of-$N$, majority voting, and beam search while using 44\% fewer verifier calls.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03978v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are increasingly deployed, auditing their chain-of-thought (CoT) traces for safety becomes critical. Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a "free gift" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most adversarial threats in artificial intelligence target the computational behavior of models rather than the humans who rely on them. Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.   This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04101v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Interfaze, a system that treats modern LLM applications as a problem of building and acting over context, not just picking the right monolithic model. Instead of a single transformer, we combine (i) a stack of heterogeneous DNNs paired with small language models as perception modules for OCR involving complex PDFs, charts and diagrams, and multilingual ASR with (ii) a context-construction layer that crawls, indexes, and parses external sources (web pages, code, PDFs) into compact structured state, and (iii) an action layer that can browse, retrieve, execute code in a sandbox, and drive a headless browser for dynamic web pages. A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.   On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data incompleteness severely impedes the reliability of multimodal systems. Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \textbf{\underline{O}}mni-\textbf{\underline{M}}odality \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\% missing rates.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04210v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imitation learning has shown success in many tasks by learning from expert demonstrations. However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop. This shows that our method is more suitable for end-users without much technical background in machine learning to train a dependable policy

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04248v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Agent-Omit.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04326v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly in the industrial domain, has amplified the challenges associated with the effective integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.

We introduce ReThinker, a confidence-aware agentic framework that orchestrates retrieval, tool use, and multi-agent reasoning through a stage-wise Solver-Critic-Selector architecture. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision. Experiments on HLE, GAIA, and XBench demonstrate that ReThinker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models with tools and existing deep research systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on expert-level reasoning tasks.

Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04575v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.   Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that plan, use tools and act has begun to shape healthcare and medicine. Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04836v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future. Our goal is not to establish a rigorous forecast of our own, but to highlight the fragility of existing forecasts of exponential growth.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning language models, which generate long chains of thought, dramatically outperform non-reasoning language models on abstract problems. However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03908v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate vehicle localization is a critical challenge in urban environments where GPS signals are often unreliable. This paper presents a cooperative multi-sensor and multi-modal localization approach to address this issue by fusing data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems. Our approach integrates cooperative data with a point cloud registration-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The system processes point clouds generated from diverse sensor modalities, including vehicle-mounted LiDAR and stereo cameras, as well as sensors deployed at intersections. By leveraging shared data from infrastructure, our method significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness in complex, GPS-noisy urban scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.03983v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding self-organization in natural collectives such as bird flocks inspires swarm robotics, yet most flocking models remain reactive, overlooking anticipatory cues that enhance coordination. Motivated by avian postural and wingbeat signals, as well as multirotor attitude tilts that precede directional changes, this work introduces a principled, bio-inspired anticipatory augmentation of reactive flocking termed Future Direction-Aware (FDA) flocking. In the proposed framework, agents blend reactive alignment with a predictive term based on short-term estimates of neighbors' future velocities, regulated by a tunable blending parameter that interpolates between reactive and anticipatory behaviors. This predictive structure enhances velocity consensus and cohesion-separation balance while mitigating the adverse effects of sensing and communication delays and measurement noise that destabilize reactive baselines. Simulation results demonstrate that FDA achieves faster and higher alignment, enhanced translational displacement of the flock, and improved robustness to delays and noise compared to a purely reactive model. Future work will investigate adaptive blending strategies, weighted prediction schemes, and experimental validation on multirotor drone swarms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neuroendovascular access often relies on passive microwires that are hand-shaped at the back table and then used to track a microcatheter to the target. Neuroendovascular surgeons determine the shape of the wire by examining the patient pre-operative images and using their experience to identify anatomy specific shapes of the wire that would facilitate reaching the target. This procedure is particularly complex in convoluted anatomical structures and is heavily dependent on the level of expertise of the surgeon. Towards enabling standardized autonomous shaping, we present a bench-top guidewire shaping robot capable of producing navigation-specific desired wire configurations. We present a model that can map the desired wire shape into robot actions, calibrated using experimental data. We show that the robot can produce clinically common tip geometries (C, S, Angled, Hook) and validate them with respect to the model-predicted shapes in 2D. Our model predicts the shape with a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.56mm across all shapes when compared to the experimental results. We also demonstrate 3D tip shaping capabilities and the ability to traverse complex endoluminal navigation from the petrous Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) to the Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm).

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a robust control and estimation framework for quadrotors operating in Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied, non-inertial environments where inertial sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) become unreliable due to platform-induced accelerations. In such settings, conventional estimators fail to distinguish whether the measured accelerations arise from the quadrotor itself or from the non-inertial platform, leading to drift and control degradation. Unlike conventional approaches that depend heavily on IMU and GNSS, our method relies exclusively on external position measurements combined with a Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) to account for platform motion. The estimator is paired with a cascaded PID controller for full 3D tracking. To isolate estimator performance from localization errors, all tests are conducted using high-precision motion capture systems. Experimental results in a moving-cart testbed validate our approach under both translational in X-axis and Y-axis dissonance. Compared to standard EKF, the proposed method significantly improves stability and trajectory tracking without requiring inertial feedback, enabling practical deployment on moving platforms such as trucks or elevators.

To assess multi-directional control along both the surface trajectory and cutting depth of this system, we conducted quantitative comparisons between manual USO (MUSO) and robotic USO (RUSO) in Sawbones phantoms under identical osteotomy conditions. The RUSO system achieved sub-millimeter trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE), an order of magnitude improvement over MUSO (1.10 mm RMSE). Moreover, MUSO trials showed substantial over-penetration (16.0 mm achieved vs. 8.0 mm target), whereas the RUSO system maintained precise depth control (8.1 mm). These results demonstrate that robotic procedures can effectively overcome the critical limitations of manual osteotomy, establishing a foundation for safer and more precise sacral resections.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in long-horizon missions that require coordination among robots with diverse capabilities. However, existing planning approaches struggle to construct accurate symbolic representations and maintain plan consistency in dynamic environments. Classical PDDL planners require manually crafted symbolic models, while LLM-based planners often ignore agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty. We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states. Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP improves performance by at least 25.5% over both LLM-only and PDDL-based variants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04137v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As robots increasingly become part of shared human spaces, their movements must transcend basic functionality by incorporating expressive qualities to enhance engagement and communication. This paper introduces a movement-centered design pedagogy designed to support engineers in creating expressive robotic arm movements. Through a hands-on interactive workshop informed by interdisciplinary methodologies, participants explored various creative possibilities, generating valuable insights into expressive motion design. The iterative approach proposed integrates analytical frameworks from dance, enabling designers to examine motion through dynamic and embodied dimensions. A custom manual remote controller facilitates interactive, real-time manipulation of the robotic arm, while dedicated animation software supports visualization, detailed motion sequencing, and precise parameter control. Qualitative analysis of this interactive design process reveals that the proposed "toolbox" effectively bridges the gap between human intent and robotic expressiveness resulting in more intuitive and engaging expressive robotic arm movements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04152v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current 3D scene graph generation (3DSGG) approaches heavily rely on a single-agent assumption and small-scale environments, exhibiting limited scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Multi-Agent 3D Scene Graph Generation (MA3DSG) model, the first framework designed to tackle this scalability challenge using multiple agents. We develop a training-free graph alignment algorithm that efficiently merges partial query graphs from individual agents into a unified global scene graph. Leveraging extensive analysis and empirical insights, our approach enables conventional single-agent systems to operate collaboratively without requiring any learnable parameters. To rigorously evaluate 3DSGG performance, we propose MA3DSG-Bench-a benchmark that supports diverse agent configurations, domain sizes, and environmental conditions-providing a more general and extensible evaluation framework. This work lays a solid foundation for scalable, multi-agent 3DSGG research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Situated embodied conversation requires robots to interleave real-time dialogue with active perception: deciding what to look at, when to look, and what to say under tight latency constraints. We present a simple, minimal system recipe that pairs a real-time multimodal language model with a small set of tool interfaces for attention and active perception. We study six home-style scenarios that require frequent attention shifts and increasing perceptual scope. Across four system variants, we evaluate turn-level tool-decision correctness against human annotations and collect subjective ratings of interaction quality. Results indicate that real-time multimodal large language models and tool use for active perception is a promising direction for practical situated embodied conversation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04174v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing industrial-scale navigation applications contend with massive road networks, typically employing two main categories of approaches for route planning. The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04208v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Endowing robots with the ability to rearrange various large and heavy objects, such as furniture, can substantially alleviate human workload. However, this task is extremely challenging due to the need to interact with diverse objects and efficiently rearrange multiple objects in complex environments while ensuring collision-free loco-manipulation. In this work, we present ALORE, an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for a legged manipulator that can rearrange various large objects across diverse scenarios. The proposed system is characterized by three main features: (i) a hierarchical reinforcement learning training pipeline for multi-object environment learning, where a high-level object velocity controller is trained on top of a low-level whole-body controller to achieve efficient and stable joint learning across multiple objects; (ii) two key modules, a unified interaction configuration representation and an object velocity estimator, that allow a single policy to regulate planar velocity of diverse objects accurately; and (iii) a task-and-motion planning framework that jointly optimizes object visitation order and object-to-target assignment, improving task efficiency while enabling online replanning. Comparisons against strong baselines show consistent superiority in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency. Key modules are systematically evaluated, and extensive simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the entire system, which successfully completes 8 continuous loops to rearrange 32 chairs over nearly 40 minutes without a single failure, and executes long-distance autonomous rearrangement over an approximately 40 m route. The open-source packages are available at https://zhihaibi.github.io/Alore/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In robotic manipulation, vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning generalizable and scalable robot policies. Most existing VLA frameworks rely on standard supervised objectives, typically cross-entropy for discrete actions and mean squared error (MSE) for continuous action regression, which impose strong pointwise constraints on individual predictions. In this work, we focus on continuous-action VLA models and move beyond conventional MSE-based regression by reshaping action error distributions during training. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into modern VLA architectures and propose a trajectory-level MEE objective, together with two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action VLA training. We evaluate our approaches across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings on multiple representative VLA architectures, using simulation benchmarks such as LIBERO and SimplerEnv as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across these settings. Under imbalanced data regimes, the gains persist within a well-characterized operating range, while incurring negligible additional training cost and no impact on inference efficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses that explain why MEE-based supervision is effective and characterize its practical range.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language-guided grasping has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling robots to identify and manipulate target objects through natural language instructions, yet it remains highly challenging in cluttered or occluded scenes. Existing methods often rely on multi-stage pipelines that separate object perception and grasping, which leads to limited cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and poor generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes. To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic manipulation continues to be a challenge, and imitation learning (IL) enables robots to learn tasks from expert demonstrations. Current IL methods typically rely on fixed camera setups, where cameras are manually positioned in static locations, imposing significant limitations on adaptability and coverage. Inspired by human active perception, where humans dynamically adjust their viewpoint to capture the most relevant and least noisy information, we propose MAE-Select, a novel framework for active viewpoint selection in single-camera robotic systems. MAE-Select fully leverages pre-trained multi-view masked autoencoder representations and dynamically selects the next most informative viewpoint at each time chunk without requiring labeled viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAE-Select improves the capabilities of single-camera systems and, in some cases, even surpasses multi-camera setups. The project will be available at https://mae-select.github.io.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04251v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems often face limitations including coarse rendering quality, insufficient recovery of scene details, and poor robustness in dynamic environments. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its efficient explicit representation and high-quality rendering capabilities, offers a new reconstruction paradigm for SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews key technical approaches for integrating 3DGS with SLAM. We analyze performance optimization of representative methods across four critical dimensions: rendering quality, tracking accuracy, reconstruction speed, and memory consumption, delving into their design principles and breakthroughs. Furthermore, we examine methods for enhancing the robustness of 3DGS-SLAM in complex environments such as motion blur and dynamic environments. Finally, we discuss future challenges and development trends in this area. This survey aims to provide a technical reference for researchers and foster the development of next-generation SLAM systems characterized by high fidelity, efficiency, and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm integrating perception, decision-making, and control within a unified learning framework. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving safe and stylized trajectory planning in complex real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04401v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04412v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humanoid robots can suffer significant performance drops under small changes in dynamics, task specifications, or environment setup. We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04419v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In partially known environments, robots must combine exploration to gather information with task planning for efficient execution. To address this challenge, we propose EPoG, an Exploration-based sequential manipulation Planning framework on Scene Graphs. EPoG integrates a graph-based global planner with a Large Language Model (LLM)-based situated local planner, continuously updating a belief graph using observations and LLM predictions to represent known and unknown objects. Action sequences are generated by computing graph edit operations between the goal and belief graphs, ordered by temporal dependencies and movement costs. This approach seamlessly combines exploration and sequential manipulation planning. In ablation studies across 46 realistic household scenes and 5 long-horizon daily object transportation tasks, EPoG achieved a success rate of 91.3%, reducing travel distance by 36.1% on average. Furthermore, a physical mobile manipulator successfully executed complex tasks in unknown and dynamic environments, demonstrating EPoG's potential for real-world applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04438v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04516v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04522v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires planners to reason jointly about free-space motion and sustained, frictional contact with the environment. Existing (local) planning and simulation frameworks typically separate these regimes or rely on simplified contact representations, particularly when modeling non-convex or distributed contact patches. Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds across tasks, from planar pushing to contact-rich whole-body maneuvers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04600v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving generalizable manipulation in unconstrained environments requires the robot to proactively resolve information uncertainty, i.e., the capability of active perception. However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reduced shoulder mobility limits upper-limb function and the performance of activities of daily living across a wide range of conditions. Wearable exosuits have shown promise in assisting arm elevation, reducing muscle effort, and supporting functional movements; however, comfort is rarely prioritized as an explicit design objective, despite it strongly affects real-life, long-term usage. This study presents a redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (Soft Shoulder v2) developed to address comfort-related limitations identified in our previous version, while preserving assistive performance. In parallel, assistance was also improved, shifting from the coronal plane to the sagittal plane to better support functionally relevant hand positioning. A controlled comparison between the previous (v1) and redesigned (v2) modules was conducted in eight healthy participants, who performed static holding, dynamic lifting, and a functional pick and place task. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes were assessed. Both versions increased endurance time, reduced deltoid activation, and preserved transparency during unpowered shoulder elevation. However, the difference between them emerged most clearly during functional tasks and comfort evaluation. The redesigned module facilitated forward arm positioning and increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30 deg, without increasing muscular demand. User-reported outcomes further indicated a substantial improvement in wearability, with markedly lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the previous design. Taken together, these findings show that targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged and daily use.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04631v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04635v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04648v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Back-support exoskeletons have been proposed to mitigate spinal loading in industrial handling, yet their effectiveness critically depends on timely and context-aware assistance. Most existing approaches rely either on load-estimation techniques (e.g., EMG, IMU) or on vision systems that do not directly inform control. In this work, we present a vision-gated control framework for an active lumbar occupational exoskeleton that leverages egocentric vision with wearable gaze tracking. The proposed system integrates real-time grasp detection from a first-person YOLO-based perception system, a finite-state machine (FSM) for task progression, and a variable admittance controller to adapt torque delivery to both posture and object state. A user study with 15 participants performing stooping load lifting trials under three conditions (no exoskeleton, exoskeleton without vision, exoskeleton with vision) shows that vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort. Quantitative analysis reveals earlier and stronger assistance when vision is enabled, while questionnaire results confirm user preference for the vision-gated mode. These findings highlight the potential of egocentric vision to enhance the responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons.

In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04851v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.

- 摘要: arXiv:2602.04880v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The choice of visual representation is key to scaling generalist robot policies. However, direct evaluation via policy rollouts is expensive, even in simulation. Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.
