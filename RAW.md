- **标题**: Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21740v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear. Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g., extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder, suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff. We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization understanding.

- **标题**: Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21757v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya, and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model (VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model, our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods. Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10 candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5% achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

- **标题**: Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation
- **作者**: Julien Boudier, Hugo Caselles-Dupr\'e

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763
- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images, they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints. Both models are released on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/obvious-research

- **标题**: H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows
- **作者**: Harry Zhang, Luca Carlone

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21769v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation, and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in modeling 3D affordance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21775v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.

- **标题**: Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis
- **作者**: Abdelilah Ganmati, Karim Afdel, Lahcen Koutti

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778
- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21778v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for 64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1 percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21780v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of 0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis, and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key characteristics of breast tumor.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates; second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync, an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays. Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

- **标题**: Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21782v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints -- remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP), bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU (0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs, making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in domain-specific SAM applications.

- **标题**: Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models
- **作者**: Guo Li, Yuyang Yu, Xuemiao Xu

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21783v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the scalability of our method.

- **标题**: Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cram\'er-Rao Bound
- **作者**: Arun Muthukkumar
- **发布时间**: 2025-10-28
- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785
- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit keypoint correspondences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21786v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures, traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for replicating the experiments and annotations.

- **作者**: Le Yang

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21787
- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21787v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms. This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance. The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness. Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory. The code is available: https://github.com/yanglebupt/mismatch-solution.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21793v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration (MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided, modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively. The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings, and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21794v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and 6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy, while incurring negligible inference overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of HIBA.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21798v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow, empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70% of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better match the natural clustering of the video frames.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21801v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations - with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy. By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%), while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and 11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA severity grading.

- **标题**: It Takes Two to Tango: Two Parallel Samplers Improve Quality in Diffusion Models for Limited Steps

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21802v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps, i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image. Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably, our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play, model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling, which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21809v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models. We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks, demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual navigation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21810v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore, early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial for diabetes-burdened regions.

Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy, speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches, inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass, making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects. Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by a substantial margin.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks. However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models, where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the structure and diversity of the training data.   We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.   This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future generative EO foundation models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair), appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia, moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model evaluation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21822v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations, which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8 percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints." The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21823v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121. These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising 7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with 94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs. 84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121 consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable, interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21827v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially. However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget pathological laboratories.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21828v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability, and scalability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21829v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete modalities scenario.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21833v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3) a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs, ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical practice.

State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet, intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process. We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated, multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head for causal temporal integration.   Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds, RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by +0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 / +2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs, improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21842v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks, as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21850v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions. To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference. Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT). The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware, fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&amp;T symbols, and surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&amp;T frames, and surface roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of 0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases, providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans. While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional, motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation realism.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21867v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics, and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in fully AVs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21876v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and healthier future.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones. TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules, preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98 $\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$ storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models, supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices. The model and code can be accessed from Hugging Face and GitHub.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21887v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse, high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis. This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured strong public interest. As they continue to advance at a rapid pace, the growing volume of research, expanding application areas, and unresolved technical challenges make it increasingly difficult to stay current. To address this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches. We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent challenges and propose future research directions, offering a structured and forward looking perspective for researchers in this fast evolving field.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost, yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22004v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting, even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia, (2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22010v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks. Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process. As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free) optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box, enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size. We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

This study proposes an automatic sign language recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit, the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as ``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education and public services.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22045v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic, model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly available decks from Zenodo (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22056v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World - an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking. Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials, with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages - demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores. However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding, while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22073v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets, including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to 0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall, our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22102v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition, leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images. Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work. % or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\% on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors, capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight, we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and CLIP architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling - assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses. Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence, arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences. While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects (e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs). To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics while retaining real-time rendering capabilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22141v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22142v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network (ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories, which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22161v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation. While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling, I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical plausibility compared to existing approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22171v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions, aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and 6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for VLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple, compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping. Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns, they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions. TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3 m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m). Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless, existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces, allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce 4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786 animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both visual quality and computational efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound while using only 1% of the target annotations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data, lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN). Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across diverse satellite sensors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline. Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation. This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme pixel-budget regimes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection, called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors. Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane, Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18 surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets 81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and 97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101.

The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second (FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However, these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting.

In this work, we introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies. To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated benchmark for Japanese cultural image classification, consisting of 374 classes. To assess the effectiveness of our dataset, we conduct experiments using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves state-of-the-art performance on several Japanese cultural benchmarks. We release our dataset, model, and code at https://speed1313.github.io/WAON.

With the emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem. However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce \textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban \textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators. This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22319v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/alijavidani/SSL-GraphNNCLR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22337v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \& product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various iterative design workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22366v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/0xD009/T2SMark}{https://github.com/0xD009/T2SMark}.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22380v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime, efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task. Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off, surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative high-performing method.

Our approach introduces both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22436v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems. Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under varying levels of snowfall

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings, featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with 84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant modalities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging (SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view, leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22480v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss, which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22507v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be found at https://github.com/YangGaoUQ/GateFuseNet

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22521v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency. However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments, such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the Bicocca25b dataset.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22534v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning, coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution (SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in super-resolution.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects, such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states (e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in VLM research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22575v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities on existing benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However, learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions. First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design (PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3 \times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for real-time UAV applications. The project is available at https://github.com/SkyEyeLoc/PFED

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22589v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions, addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end, PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout), which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets, highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work, we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score. In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse, distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative, quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact network parameters for practical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock, especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations - a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments. While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87, PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22630v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts, achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22650v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency. We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22665v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The code and datasets will be released soon.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22669v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22673v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs) are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components. First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and schedules.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22683v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof), or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.

In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks, including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation. The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22697v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics, encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset (fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks. The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22706v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a 3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data curation pipeline.

We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over $414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource, LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age, and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts. The dataset is publicly available at: https://lrw-persian.vercel.app.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22736v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution, and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding. Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis, reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising directions for future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22743v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities. Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy, reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by 4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical image analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22803v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone, medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5 diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical readiness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22810v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation. To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation. MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames. Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy, offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22827v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues, lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1]; constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions; unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions. We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes. Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR), a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD) for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning, visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency across diverse visual styles.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22842v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22851v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance. Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed, comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting. Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22916v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm * 30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors (AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual, spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available on the official Kaggle webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/csiro-biomass

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22930v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments. State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat, that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive 3D AI applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22936v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22937v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend this work to other biometrics in the future.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes, such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22946v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22960v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME} for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings. Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing VE baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22964v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments, VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective. Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over prior methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving, enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation. Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22975v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22994v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images. While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and (ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a ``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator, highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films, and games.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22995v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final, highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations. Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication, concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales, mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures (i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency. Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully interpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation, enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video. CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second, in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs; however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement (PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions. UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets: 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29), UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it improved perceptual quality significantly.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23020v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale, multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark. Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.}

While existing studies have proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide a robust foundation for future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However, their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model, which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP) blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

However, their ability to generalize beyond training data distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most 3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing 3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the 3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy compared to the baseline method.

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so, reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks. DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of the salinity variance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23137v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares (TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which, although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion, provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).

This capability facilitates deployment and advances the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work, we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in 3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism. Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in complex industrial scenes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23184v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23190v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii) halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23225v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF, DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake, referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques. Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods, intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing. A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones. Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the textual prompt, improving content adherence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering (VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes. Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often overlook.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23299v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions. Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23301v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors (e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components: modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of 9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios, respectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.Project page: https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23325v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis: the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations, presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep learning in medical imaging.   Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex 3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.   Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset, demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features applicable to various downstream tasks.   In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning in medical imaging.

We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for future medical image research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23368v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations, each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23382v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models, especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution, yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision agriculture.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23414v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples, enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and innovation in point cloud learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23416v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23429v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up, geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs, and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details. Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling: sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task. Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the reconstruction process.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23442v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques, leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However, the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples, enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50. Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%, 80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain \textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and +2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker, which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability. Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23479v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality. To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23482v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23494v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric video relighting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23497v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs, no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23525v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However, we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks.

However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic degra- dation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation, starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play- and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and im- prove the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves state-of- the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23581v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization, identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal conditioning across several different architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23588v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23589v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from 386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics. To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23594v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation. It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified. Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed, such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation, in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20867v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning, domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.   We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms, filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.   Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707% improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31% market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing assumptions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs, MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally, MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Despite increasing access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution, which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across vulnerable mountainous terrains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: "Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities, particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach against competing methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20878v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20925v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets, traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning. In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20952v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance. Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics, not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20960v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training. Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its adaptive feedback mechanism.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate (MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection. However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection.

Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate the advantages of the proposed estimator.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation, synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10 cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is available at https://github.com/desResLab/nrf.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.

We present MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning. MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20985v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20995v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations, Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.20997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.   To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.   We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required. Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$ training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and high-quality AR modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with *controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air **R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)* framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21020v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule -- and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent. However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s) and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime" with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent. Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation} (iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate, physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple, foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling - performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically modulate detectability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature. First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution. Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism -- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in practical settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning (RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains, however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG), natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity, while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO algorithms.

The PSP dataset (2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters, including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms; our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities, particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well defined.

Prior works on the theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21081v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand, their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times. Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and 1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21086v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes: encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL, a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation. It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and 4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated learning is practical for real-world deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph, yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors, and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes. By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of power grids.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex, large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions, facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for advancing automated molecular design.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21172v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers, we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local minimum.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables (temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance, obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep working on this area.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21177v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.   We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) -- to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21184v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches and alternatives.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose \underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N} (PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings. PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference, reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process. Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025 editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can); if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection (holds true only for accepted papers).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However, minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize, as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss, and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data. Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online AUC performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models (TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples. This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap. We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with better sample efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21207v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability. Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning, alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence on diverse graphs and tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21210v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates, however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.   Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints.   We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model. Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21232v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

In this work, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime. We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function, SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression setting.

Owing to their versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade, aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and experimentation.

However, second-order methods induce large memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of second-order training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA.

Our method leverages the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training, particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21292v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable* within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations are possible or provably hard.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies, leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21300v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21303v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance -- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it with rigorous proofs.   Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation techniques.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21312v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret, which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards, aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness axioms.   To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the $p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all $p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret bounds.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g., moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions, explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation. In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF, a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF) architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module, enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic 2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21332v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts, often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30% on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21345v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption (LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning, designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as fine-tuning LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies. Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues, especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21361v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21363v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen (https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21367v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention. edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning. Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21379v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy. Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring, (ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21402v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21417v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions -- corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast, self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94% training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21427v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids, challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts. To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states, and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT) and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21450v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling, but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures. To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear RNN models at scale.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21455v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS), is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item. In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six cities of different sizes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21457v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training. This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at https://github.com/chaewoonbae/ZEN.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21491v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting. Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21506v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$ Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$ learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable, solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21523v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction, high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian structure learning task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21525v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response, enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA, routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm, requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10 seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2) retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new probes after training.   First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit - simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy. Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is feasible.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation, pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy, significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions, before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles, modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices (UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning, computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game (MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence stability and scalability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21551v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv (HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction. Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a 3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting performance on complex, real-world graph data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21582v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data. Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the training error is zero.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision, their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets, which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21592v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training. Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar) with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data. Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods: Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows, to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21610v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and simulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21631v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably, CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21638v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics, suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21669v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21691v2 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique, to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21706v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases. We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations. The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer vision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21720v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques. Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust, scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing, showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach, demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21721v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets. We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems, education, and recommendation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling) reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse (complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse architectural approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21881v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges. Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model produces correct answers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21886v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, se- lecting edges for spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions. For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance, GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances where classical exact methods become infeasible.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial $q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in $q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability, providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis. Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems, $\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL (greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial $q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a generative access model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques, creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications, offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection. However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by 53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey simulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21999v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence. The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5 crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding, Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning. Our repository is released on https://github.com/Ljyustc/FoI-MWP.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models (starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks. Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment. Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

In this paper, we study this issue from a venture capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.   On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters, showing promise to extend into other domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.

The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and actionable cost/performance trade-offs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics. We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention. Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

The AI market size is projected to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

To overcome these challenges, recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors, demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe, trustworthy, and effective.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22132v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel approach for controllable mathematical reasoning that leverages self-optimizing thought vectors with entropy minimization. Our method introduces learnable thought vectors that dynamically modulate the internal reasoning process of large language models. Using Gemma-2-9B on GSM8K, we achieve 90.1% accuracy with a controllability score of 0.42, demonstrating that entropy-based rewards effectively guide focused reasoning patterns without requiring external reward annotations. Our analysis reveals distinct thought vector clusters and consistent low-entropy distributions across control conditions, validating our framework for controllable AI reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions; and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8 persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000 SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the public.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model, we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\% improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/OptiTree/tree/main.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22255v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend. We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising 647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these issues. Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language and music.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric. The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality, particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques, highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction. The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction, outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score. Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests. Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22371v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large, real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22437v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However, understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open problem, with many potential important applications including improving training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction, augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states, we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze, interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80 players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods (erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22590v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG) construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained "atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17% better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods, demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22594v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process. As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer, and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide experiments to validate our theoretical results.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty, resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals. Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score, outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial validation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder. Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10 Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness (pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response, including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical, computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore, its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from ``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google, High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in a way that makes the most of its strengths.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches, and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22780v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases: Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365 E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static, fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.   This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22833v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint? If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22836v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities. Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the \textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning.

The derivation of this metric accounts for discretization errors and state prediction errors introduced by the incremental model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction, causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22898v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math & Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.   To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the computational cost.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22942v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing. GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM), enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management. Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field (MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues, this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction (InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable, adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method, we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler, therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation, we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial examples for the first time.

The system indexes a multimodal knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria, and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma \le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$, with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy explanations.

However, systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical contexts remains underexplored. Moreover, a comprehensive and standardized framework for assessing the trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports is yet to be established. This study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated liver MRI reports by introducing a Multi-Dimensional Credibility Assessment (MDCA) framework and providing guidance on institution-specific prompt optimization. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate and compare the performance of several advanced LLMs, including Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, DeepSeek-V3, and ByteDance-Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct, using the SiliconFlow platform.

Training models to skip steps in their trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters. MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL task domains.

This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape, obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation, Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems (2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human scientific inquiry.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23062v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level. However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources, they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate students' learning situation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23083v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps. Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4 family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of process rewards and outcome rewards.   Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs. Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language, risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality, introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis.

For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models. Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors, such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations are available from https://sites.google.com/view/submission-fog.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's (MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23216v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today. Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate. Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the series.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs), have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits comparable performance to that using the existing method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed. This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes, we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n increases.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication, formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA) modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

In current times due to growth of social networking website and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions (or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23410v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding foundation model in computational advertising.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23424v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance. Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference.

It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test, compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines, shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity, enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts, including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification, regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23506v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.

This paper critiques the prevailing reliance on large-scale, static datasets and monolithic training paradigms, advocating for a shift toward human-inspired, sustainable AI solutions. We introduce a novel framework, Human AI (HAI), which emphasizes incremental learning, carbon-aware optimization, and human-in-the-loop collaboration to enhance adaptability, efficiency, and accountability. By drawing parallels with biological cognition and leveraging dynamic architectures, HAI seeks to balance performance with ecological responsibility. We detail the theoretical foundations, system design, and operational principles that enable AI to learn continuously and contextually while minimizing carbon footprints and human annotation costs. Our approach addresses pressing challenges in active learning, continual adaptation, and energy-efficient model deployment, offering a pathway toward responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

This visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However, progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data, a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions, visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models. Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal, machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

Yet, public attitudes toward AI use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored. Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488) representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1) and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts. The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from 23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%. These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public preferences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23595v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&amp;A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle, spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental results show ...

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21734v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder. Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces, suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback, improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21735v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking. Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains challenging.   To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI (PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in traffic simulations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21736v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control (ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption. Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions, thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99% increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39% improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in traffic dynamics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21739v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones, while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii) Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales: multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21744v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix. Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over the native VLA baselines with both OpenVLA and Octo-Base. Gains remain consistent under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon variants. Videos available at: https://taco-group.github.io/FORGE-Tree/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21746v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning. Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out at https://avi-3drobot.github.io/.

By leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC), we develop trajectories that optimize both the traversal of speed bumps and overall passenger comfort. A key contribution of this work is the formulation of speed bump handling constraints that closely emulate human driving behavior, seamlessly integrating these with broader road navigation requirements. Through extensive simulations in varied urban driving environments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its ability to ensure smooth speed transitions over speed bumps while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment. The method's capability to handle both static road features and dynamic constraints, alongside expert human driving, represents a significant step forward in trajectory planning for urban

This work presents an in-depth review of RL principles, advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, and their integration into robotic and control systems. Beginning with the formalism of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the study outlines essential elements of the agent-environment interaction and explores core algorithmic strategies including actor-critic methods, value-based learning, and policy gradients. Emphasis is placed on modern DRL techniques such as DDPG, TD3, PPO, and SAC, which have shown promise in solving high-dimensional, continuous control tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced to categorize RL applications across domains such as locomotion, manipulation, multi-agent coordination, and human-robot interaction, along with training methodologies and deployment readiness levels. The review synthesizes recent research efforts, highlighting technical trends, design patterns, and the growing maturity of RL in real-world robotics. Overall, this work aims to bridge theoretical advances with practical implementations, providing a consolidated perspective on the evolving role of RL in autonomous robotic systems.

J-ORA is designed to support three critical perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g., category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs) reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes. Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These findings underscore the importance of rich, context-sensitive attribute annotations in advancing robot perception in dynamic environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: By 2050, the global demand for assistive care is expected to reach 3.5 billion people, far outpacing the availability of human caregivers. Existing robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual cameras, and 3D-printed grippers. Data collection via teleoperation with a leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments motion dynamics, while a Temporal Ensemble (TE) method refines trajectories to improve accuracy and smoothness. Evaluated across five model sizes and four architectures, with ten hours of real-world testing, the system achieved over 90% task accuracy, up to 40% higher than baselines. PACT enabled a 5x model size reduction while maintaining 75% accuracy. Saliency analysis showed reliance on key visual cues, and phase token gradients peaked at critical trajectory moments, indicating effective temporal reasoning. Future work will explore bimanual manipulation and mobility for expanded assistive capabilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) underpins real-time robotics by enabling efficient, constrained optimization in state estimation, motion planning, and control. In legged locomotion and manipulation, essential modules like inverse dynamics, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Whole-Body Control (WBC) are inherently QP-based, demanding reliable solutions amid tight timing, energy, and computational limits on embedded platforms. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and benchmarking study of cutting-edge QP solvers for legged robotics. We begin by formulating the standard convex QP and classify solvers into four principal algorithmic approaches, including interior-point methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented Lagrangian approaches. Each solver is examined in terms of algorithmic structure, computational characteristics, and its ability to exploit problem structure and warm-starting. Performance is evaluated using publicly available benchmarks, focusing on metrics such as computation time, constraint satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations. Feature tables and comparisons yield practical guidance for solver selection, underscoring trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize the synergy between solver, task, and hardware, sparse IPMs for long-horizon MPC, and dense active-set for high frequency WBC to advance agile, autonomous legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP.

This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior. Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more natural and capable embodied assistants.

Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of Stewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and nano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise, complicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges smartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is crucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with much ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various calibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments, constraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for auto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key methodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse kinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple sources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in some cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the present state of the art in this field and highlight the processes and errors considered for the calibration of Stewart-Gough platforms.

Current state-of-the-art robotic systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control. Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding. We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic wind fields must generate safe and energy-efficient trajectories under physical and environmental constraints. Traditional planners, such as A* and kinodynamic RRT*, often yield suboptimal or non-smooth paths due to discretization and sampling limitations. This paper presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that embeds UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle avoidance directly into the learning process. Without requiring supervised data, the PINN learns dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories by minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives. Comparative simulations show that the proposed method outperforms A* and Kino-RRT* in control energy, smoothness, and safety margin, while maintaining similar flight efficiency. The results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning to unify model-based and data-driven planning, providing a scalable and physically consistent framework for UAV trajectory optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.21991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE).   Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22030v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stability of bipedal systems in frontal plane is affected by the hip offset, to the extent that adjusting stride time using feedforward retraction and extension of the legs can lead to stable oscillations without feedback control. This feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort and energy expenditure and increase the locomotion robustness. However, there is limited understanding of how key parameters, such as mass, stiffness, leg length, and hip width, affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analyzing how individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the minimum stride frequency required to maintain a stable cycle. We propose a method to predict the minimum stride frequency, and compare the predicted stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models. The findings of this work provide a better understanding of the frontal plane stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort.

However, the predominant joystick-based control interfaces can be challenging due to high precision requirements and unintuitive reference frames.

To address these challenges, we present an egocentric, gaze-guided robotic manipulation interface that leverages a wearable Mixed Reality (MR) headset. Our system enables users to interact seamlessly with real-world objects using natural gaze fixation from a first-person perspective, while providing augmented visual cues to confirm intent and leveraging a pretrained vision model and robotic arm for intent recognition and object manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves manipulation accuracy, reduces system latency, and achieves single-pass intention and object recognition accuracy greater than 88% across multiple real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in enhancing intuitiveness and accessibility, underscoring its practical significance for assistive robotics applications.

A multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and outstanding performance of EasyUUV in achieving robust and adaptive UUV attitude control across diverse underwater conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation, these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric, multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments, demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in dynamically changing indoor environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies, enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial. In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor) environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline, where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations (adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps, and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) in dynamic environments, where conventional methods often fail due to their static-world assumptions. Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse environments. Current approaches to dynamic LIO face a fundamental challenge: accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features, yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness directly into the point cloud registration process. We introduce a novel dynamic-aware iterative closest point algorithm that leverages spatio-temporal normal analysis, complemented by an efficient spatial consistency verification method to enhance static map construction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LIO systems in challenging dynamic environments with limited geometric structure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22336v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace. Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology. Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper, we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that \ourmethod{} achieves an average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the 3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and 0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal data fusion for precise shape estimation under loading conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22370v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals. Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards. Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation. This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We make our code publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22420v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization. Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence, and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex stochastic systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social Robot Navigation is the skill that allows robots to move efficiently in human-populated environments while ensuring safety, comfort, and trust. Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot Navigation can hinder the progress of the field and may lead to contradicting conclusions. Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July 2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review. This review addresses the metrics used in the literature for benchmarking purposes, the algorithms employed in such benchmarks, the use of human surveys for benchmarking, and how conclusions are drawn from the benchmarking results, when applicable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a method to generate feasible, unique forward-kinematic solutions for a general Stewart platform. This is done by using inverse kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and corresponding actuator lengths for the moving platform. For parallel kinematic machines, such as the Stewart Platform, inverse kinematics are straight forward, but the forward kinematics are complex and generates multiple solutions due to the closed loop structure of the kinematic links. In this research, a simple iterative algorithm has been used employing modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The outcome is encouraging as this method generates a single feasible forward kinematic solution for each valid pose with the solved DH parameters and unlike earlier forward kinematics solutions, this unique solution does not need to be manually verified. Therefore, the forward kinematic solutions can be used directly for further calculations without the need for manual pose verification. This capability is essential for the six degree of freedom materials testing system developed by the authors in their laboratory. The developed system is aimed at characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex combined multiple loading conditions. The material characterization is done by enabling high precision force control on the moving platform via in situ calibration of the as-built kinematics of the Stewart Gough Platform.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip, enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body. Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward and horizontal curvatures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In natural systems, emergent structures often arise to balance competing demands. Army ants, for example, form temporary "walls" that prevent interference between foraging trails. Inspired by this behavior, we developed two decentralized controllers for heterogeneous robotic swarms to maintain spatial separation while executing concurrent tasks. The first is a finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller that uses encounter-triggered transitions to create rigid, stable walls. The second integrates FSM states with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamically optimizing separation through emergent "demilitarized zones." In simulation, both controllers reduce mixing between subgroups, with the DQN-enhanced controller improving adaptability and reducing mixing by 40-50% while achieving faster convergence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces SPIRAL (Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for Learning), a novel approach for training autonomous drones in multi-agent racing competitions. SPIRAL distinctively employs a self-play mechanism to incrementally cultivate complex racing behaviors within a challenging, dynamic environment. Through this self-play core, drones continuously compete against increasingly proficient versions of themselves, naturally escalating the difficulty of competitive interactions. This progressive learning journey guides agents from mastering fundamental flight control to executing sophisticated cooperative multi-drone racing strategies. Our method is designed for versatility, allowing integration with any state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms within its self-play framework. Simulations demonstrate the significant advantages of SPIRAL and benchmark the performance of various DRL algorithms operating within it. Consequently, we contribute a versatile, scalable, and self-improving learning framework to the field of autonomous drone racing. SPIRAL's capacity to autonomously generate appropriate and escalating challenges through its self-play dynamic offers a promising direction for developing robust and adaptive racing strategies in multi-agent environments. This research opens new avenues for enhancing the performance and reliability of autonomous racing drones in increasingly complex and competitive scenarios.

This paper presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone Racing), a reinforcement learning framework designed to solve this challenge in the demanding domain of multi-drone racing. CRUISE overcomes key scalability limitations by synergistically combining a progressive difficulty curriculum with an efficient self-play mechanism to foster robust competitive behaviors. Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement learning baseline and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner. CRUISE achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation studies confirm that the curriculum structure is the critical component for this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic, competitive tasks and serves as a blueprint for future real-world deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22600v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The reliability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is severely constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low illumination. Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter, attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22680v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data. This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction. Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more robust autonomous driving.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22699v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing need for autonomous on-orbit services such as inspection, maintenance, and situational awareness calls for intelligent spacecraft capable of complex maneuvers around large orbital targets. Traditional control systems often fall short in adaptability, especially under model uncertainties, multi-spacecraft configurations, or dynamically evolving mission contexts. This paper introduces RL-AVIST, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonomous Visual Inspection of Space Targets. Leveraging the Space Robotics Bench (SRB), we simulate high-fidelity 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics and train agents using DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm, with PPO and TD3 as model-free baselines. Our investigation focuses on 3D proximity maneuvering tasks around targets such as the Lunar Gateway and other space assets. We evaluate task performance under two complementary regimes: generalized agents trained on randomized velocity vectors, and specialized agents trained to follow fixed trajectories emulating known inspection orbits. Furthermore, we assess the robustness and generalization of policies across multiple spacecraft morphologies and mission domains. Results demonstrate that model-based RL offers promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity, and sample efficiency, paving the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space operations

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents environment-adaptive pinch-lifting built on a slot-constrained adaptive linkage (SCAL) and instantiated in two complementary fingers: SCAL-R, a rotational-drive design with an active fingertip that folds inward after contact to form an envelope, and SCAL-L, a linear-drive design that passively opens on contact to span wide or weak-feature objects. Both fingers convert surface following into an upward lifting branch while maintaining fingertip orientation, enabling thin or low-profile targets to be raised from supports with minimal sensing and control. Two-finger grippers are fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing. Experiments evaluate (i) contact-preserving sliding and pinch-lifting on tabletops, (ii) ramp negotiation followed by lift, and (iii) handling of bulky objects via active enveloping (SCAL-R) or contact-triggered passive opening (SCAL-L). Across dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls, both designs achieve consistent grasps with limited tuning. A quasi-static analysis provides closed-form fingertip-force models for linear parallel pinching and two-point enveloping, offering geometry-aware guidance for design and operation. Overall, the results indicate complementary operating regimes and a practical path to robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22740v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM often encounters challenges in similar indoor environments characterized by repetitive structures, such as corridors and rooms. These challenges can lead to significant inaccuracies in shared location identification when employing point cloud-based techniques. To mitigate these issues, we introduce TWC-SLAM, a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that integrates text semantics and WiFi signal features to enhance location identification and loop closure detection. TWC-SLAM comprises a single-agent front-end odometry module based on FAST-LIO2, a location identification and loop closure detection module that leverages text semantics and WiFi features, and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex environments with repetitive architectural features.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans. While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor scalability, and low coordination efficiency.   We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem, explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous navigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level collision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often fail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its low-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To address this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that accurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with provable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a history of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a computationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel evaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern sampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural predictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware experiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in a challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's ability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware planning on dynamic robotic platforms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior. Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice. By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22825v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique, resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism. Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing and control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL), which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components, improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22917v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Objective-oriented navigation(ObjNav) enables robot to navigate to target object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav. Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation (HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the navigation performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.22949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents the complete design, control, and experimental validation of a low-cost Stewart platform prototype developed as an affordable yet capable robotic testbed for research and education. The platform combines off the shelf components with 3D printed and custom fabricated parts to deliver full six degrees of freedom motions using six linear actuators connecting a moving platform to a fixed base. The system software integrates dynamic modeling, data acquisition, and real time control within a unified framework. A robust trajectory tracking controller based on feedback linearization, augmented with an LQR scheme, compensates for the platform's nonlinear dynamics to achieve precise motion control. In parallel, an Extended Kalman Filter fuses IMU and actuator encoder feedback to provide accurate and reliable state estimation under sensor noise and external disturbances. Unlike prior efforts that emphasize only isolated aspects such as modeling or control, this work delivers a complete hardware-software platform validated through both simulation and experiments on static and dynamic trajectories. Results demonstrate effective trajectory tracking and real-time state estimation, highlighting the platform's potential as a cost effective and versatile tool for advanced research and educational applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23057v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas. Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we will release the codes to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms. Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23084v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Orographic soaring can significantly extend the endurance of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), but circling behavior, arising from control conflicts between the longitudinal and vertical axes, increases energy consumption and the risk of divergence. We propose a control switching method, named SAOS: Switched Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring, which mitigates circling behavior by selectively controlling either the horizontal or vertical axis, effectively transforming the system from underactuated to fully actuated during soaring. Additionally, the angle of attack is incorporated into the INDI controller to improve force estimation. Simulations with randomized initial positions and wind tunnel experiments on two MAVs demonstrate that the SAOS improves position convergence, reduces throttle usage, and mitigates roll oscillations caused by pitch-roll coupling. These improvements enhance energy efficiency and flight stability in constrained soaring environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23109v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying system (ATL system) with integrated uniaxial force control to ensure the necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore, it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human commands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23121v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human interventions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

We address this with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot. Our method matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in terms of rewards while significantly reducing the control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency control under real-world conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one. Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand, this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users avoid scams.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23234v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter, enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive multi-sensor systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is essential for field and planetary robotics, where robots must efficiently reach goals while avoiding obstacles under uncertain conditions. Conventional algorithmic approaches often require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative, allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains, where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings. The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to 50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added benefit of minimizing retraining costs.

To deliver these services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio, and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the inconsistency problem caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS). The key idea involves applying a linear time-varying transformation to the error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This transformation ensures that \textrr{the unobservable subspace of the transformed error-state system} becomes independent of the state, thereby preserving the correct observability of the transformed system against variations in linearization points. We introduce the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF), a consistent VINS estimator that performs state estimation using the transformed error-state system. Furthermore, we develop an efficient propagation technique to accelerate the covariance propagation based on the transformation relationship between the transition and accumulated matrices of T-ESKF and ESKF. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating better (or competitive at least) performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at github.com/HITCSC/T-ESKF.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23386v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force, velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation, yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback, and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23495v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time, enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human intents for open-ended and long-term HRC.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23509v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23511v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we present Dexbotic, an open-source Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model toolbox based on PyTorch. It aims to provide a one-stop VLA research service for professionals in the field of embodied intelligence. It offers a codebase that supports multiple mainstream VLA policies simultaneously, allowing users to reproduce various VLA methods with just a single environment setup. The toolbox is experiment-centric, where the users can quickly develop new VLA experiments by simply modifying the Exp script. Moreover, we provide much stronger pretrained models to achieve great performance improvements for state-of-the-art VLA policies. Dexbotic will continuously update to include more of the latest pre-trained foundation models and cutting-edge VLA models in the industry.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers, providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions, supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23521v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Remembering where object segments were predicted in the past is useful for improving the accuracy and consistency of class-agnostic video segmentation algorithms. Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no object-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of recurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both types of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the resulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we develop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted object-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on this 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve their respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used to validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings. Results from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that models which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent predictions than those which use no memory or only implicit neural network memories.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2510.23576v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills: low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.
