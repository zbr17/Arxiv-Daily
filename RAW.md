- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19840v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95, significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of industrial AI systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines. For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness, overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20011v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the medical imaging domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point. However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors, particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to fisheye imagery.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20027v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry predictions from the model.   To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate outside the original training viewpoints.   Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20029v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain. Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I) systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics, a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1) under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve; and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props) rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in generative image models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection of fiducial markers.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features. Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5), with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10). Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001), and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications. Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research (e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}: SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions. (2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations, whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv), a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks. Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain \textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times 3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster sampling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline. Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP (i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our system has significant applications for improving robot perception on autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection and tracking of challenging small objects.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20132v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships. After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20134v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space. Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20155v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering, a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity. By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D understanding.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure. 6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles, but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20162v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20165v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output. The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover, the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost. To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a `play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer computational costs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters. Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance, focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions. Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%. Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction, skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a 3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models. We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1}, Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++ achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in T2V generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy, ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions, CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis, paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential. A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose \emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task, requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However, existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations, we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship between the instance field and language field, through a novel instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long, untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces (1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20247v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving, urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware." Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity, which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels, enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

It has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset containing 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and detection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall of 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5 (mAP50(B)) of 97.21\%. Using the voice feedback after the detection would help the visually impaired to identify the currency. This paper aims to create a practical and efficient currency detection system to empower visually impaired individuals independent in handling money.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20281v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets, comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore, we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across different datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR) image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting, optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition, offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy AI in SAR image analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples. Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the \textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse in the SFT+RL framework.

Most of these works have been targeted towards a limited subset of popular sports like soccer, cricket, basketball etc; focusing on generative tasks like visual question answering, highlight generation. This work analyzes the applicability of the modern video foundation models (both encoder and decoder) for a very niche but hugely popular dance sports - breakdance. Our results show that Video Encoder models continue to outperform state-of-the-art Video Language Models for prediction tasks. We provide insights on how to choose the encoder model and provide a thorough analysis into the workings of a finetuned decoder model for breakdance video classification.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20291v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\% additional parameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20348v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method, dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps. That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images, while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20438v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights, our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic, enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model, which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet, enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000 histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images (99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20470v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further. To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20482v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness. To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy, fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However, personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP). Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output. Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy, wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress, current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries, leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper, we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR. A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context (Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation. Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks, FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20539v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20549v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D, ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of 87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range, and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color, which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional image enhancement modules.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20578v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20579v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20586v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation. The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20596v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift, unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging, particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20622v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs) can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260 studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20639v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20669v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization. Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation, inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map (Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps, improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset, HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations, the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities, circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20673v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model. However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/EMQNet_jk.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20707v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20708v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general, sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits, demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20726v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e., rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and 43.0\%, respectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve. Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K 256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space, Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery; and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3 dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20794v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20803v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20812v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects. Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images (HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against supervised baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20819v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation. Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20822v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence, HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at: https://holo-cine.github.io/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems, with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training. This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19873v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments. To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models. ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19889v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis, traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time, while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information. The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions, supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19893v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations. While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5 clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2% against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced disparities across demographic groups.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19896v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems, optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19917v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces. The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods, its failure modes, and other limitations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19933v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists: Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling, with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision changes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19934v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server. However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication, and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in decentralized privacy accounting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19941v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression, assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$ iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances within and between greedy and random orderings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices. However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets, enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes, offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19953v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper, we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19975v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using $\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional methods under specific conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19977v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally \underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic \underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric (anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different $\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions, allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to $182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at \href{https://github.com/youbin2014/UCAN/}{https://github.com/youbin2014/UCAN/}}

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19980v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations) during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient and robust forecasting models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19990v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models. Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2) multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks, any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance. At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces. Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second, we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines. However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection, spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000 balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and sensor fusion with other modalities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment, derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and \num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20031v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential, limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors: delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension, $H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model (LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long reasoning chains are required.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20066v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969; Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors (HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74 assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap, Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided in the artifact repository.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both (i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions, one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to existing approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20084v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20085v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt. The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3 Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20106v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly, with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs (30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2, Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable, marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous finite-sample theory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets, it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around 10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations -- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure, independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20148v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent AD cohort.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However, existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP). This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20169v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second" strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to the optimal solution.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20187v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels, RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy: concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al. STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?   In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires $\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20209v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126 analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15). While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall (0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will require integration of multi-modal data sources.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume, operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates. Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C, CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness, scalability and convergence stability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness (balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm. Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet, Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as much balance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV (Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer, Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving superior fine-tuning performance.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20225v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD). MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20235v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms previous baselines in many MORL environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17 Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20242v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration -- often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking. Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal oracle behavior more closely.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question: \textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS} (\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits. Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20270v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments.   To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.   As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems.   Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.

We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3) PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities, which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities; and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types of temporal features.The code is available at https://github.com/TanQitai/SynTSBench

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs. Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption. Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

We refer to this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of scientific Q&amp;A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even 7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as reliable collaborators in CS research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

In this paper, we propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations, while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention. We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and 2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the number of variables increases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at https://github.com/anonymifish/lego-rec-multiple-attribute-unlearning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20349v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20383v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20387v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens. Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on centralization versus specialization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20413v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified, resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution. On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20414v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction, especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20428v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust. Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center, gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction, perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency, delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data. Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41 participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios. patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing drug-drug interaction networks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach successfully exploits.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20468v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20477v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL, forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play methodology named $\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels, by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the performance of existing methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20486v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model. Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact events.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20540v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces. This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training. SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information. Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities, with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20542v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL, which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.   We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations, which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20556v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM). We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to generalize to larger and more complex problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning, yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong (bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES) condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i) chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity. (1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3 family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20611v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms, and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent, model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20615v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification, significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra. While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's effectiveness and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes (larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$ setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20627v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at https://github.com/neu-spiral/H-SPLID.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20629v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare, structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis, censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical care.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning (DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives, varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where conventional static optimization degrades.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20640v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes, and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it 4.5 out of 5.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20644v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information. Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20651v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare, these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme events improving from 3% to 78%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming, particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20668v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most promising path towards true world models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20683v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments. Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible (re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network (RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional. We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial. We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional generalization to unseen tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and transitions. We prove a regret bound of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$, where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20733v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy, ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence. While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of compute or data scale.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20736v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20762v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces. However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging, remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20783v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs - are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios, designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles. In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i) Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected -- eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just 100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20817v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in "mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models). Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength, and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19835v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19836v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval, report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i) employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19842v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2 exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal cost-efficiency.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19954v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims. Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave of fraud.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19964v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning, suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129 master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture, Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports. The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent. The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM, LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students' strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in high-stakes finance.

The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection, and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop, dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial forensics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20109v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice, given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b) lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic responsibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure, prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4) Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20190v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures, refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement, highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20252v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation. We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression, advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on. We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these. The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the associated fluents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement. We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34 to 0.56.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20310v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline, we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by 9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see https://tooleqa.github.io.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20332v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare. However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging project, part of Spain's national R&amp;D initiative, where our task was to detect biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender, age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems in healthcare.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20337v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20345v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.   We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure, normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify their limitations.   Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20377v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

The model implemented five functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further model development

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20457v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases. Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20467v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2) provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI), and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies. Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue. Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover, officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns. They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback; broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make participation easier.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20591v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems, which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns, achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions: relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE). This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context, which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20604v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes, demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20621v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust, accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20632v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce, existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese, leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex, real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce. EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks), sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs, reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior work.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20636v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states, assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment for optimal fluidity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20641v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML) models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20665v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient, automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future reinforcement learning algorithms.

While large language models have advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design, enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized \textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll (CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes \textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect \textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5, the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20809v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over 10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19962v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models, selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and repeatability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19974v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly, yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6, 3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project page: https://dairlab.github.io/push-anything.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20008v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning. Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a small ARM-based single-board computer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20070v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc. All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based, constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases, environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further exploration in a specific area.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20079v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms. Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as implemented on this platform.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20161v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding, enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20% validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6 with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60 language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate, reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20174v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity, and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20177v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three, fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1) nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4) computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound, and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation maintenance problem.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent, capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way, compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav". We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E) approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real transfer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and 7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg} between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 % success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success. Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20390v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation, often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple, predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry, from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods, offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities, where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context. Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20407v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness. Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload (NASA--TLX). Overall, the results confirm that \textit{MR-UBi} enables more stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot-arm teleoperation through the integration of visual and haptic feedback.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines. The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree, which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size, weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements. LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian. A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism. Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20490v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed. These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two (parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The results confirm the validity of this approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20496v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging, since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response, there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim, we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are available online: https://github.com/mit-ll/rubble_pile_simulator.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20685v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic, open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at https://bigtree765.github.io/C-Nav-project.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20706v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait, leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking, energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward, extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning. Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20808v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world. Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics. Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation. By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer, state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape, highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap and sim-to-real transfer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1) learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual reinforcement learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.20818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website: https://vamos-vla.github.io/
