- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments of land use change and its climate impacts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02933v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties, such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray dataset.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02946v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02953v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments. However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions, including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration. EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets, providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs, they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction. Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02996v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g., radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision, demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation, and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03004v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the "Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures (FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250, 500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

- **标题**: A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration
- **作者**: Minh Sao Khue Luu, Bair N. Tuchinov

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014
- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more detail.

- **标题**: SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment
- **作者**: Wenbo Lu

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03019v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational supervision for cross-modal alignment.

- **标题**: From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth
- **作者**: Ziyang Xu, Olaf Wysocki, Christoph Holst

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053
- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03053v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM, deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT) for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications. To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research, this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster), providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03098v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial use upon request.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03099v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts, observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views, rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud, followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

- **标题**: Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects, we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding. Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than 6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

- **标题**: Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response
- **作者**: Thomas Manzini, Priyankari Perali, Robin R. Murphy

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03132v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes. This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML research and user communities.

- **标题**: Finetuning-Free Personalization of Text to Image Generation via Hypernetworks
- **作者**: Sagar Shrestha, Gopal Sharma, Luowei Zhou, Suren Kumar

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03156
- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03156v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization, yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG), which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features. To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark. On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability, we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and 734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics, while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32 frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation. PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future aware surgical assistance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03194v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Publicly available, large-scale medical imaging datasets are crucial for developing and validating artificial intelligence models and conducting retrospective clinical research. However, datasets that combine functional and anatomical imaging with detailed clinical reports across multiple cancer types remain scarce. Here, we present PETWB-REP, a curated dataset comprising whole-body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scans and corresponding radiology reports from 490 patients diagnosed with various malignancies. The dataset primarily includes common cancers such as lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. This dataset includes paired PET and CT images, de-identified textual reports, and structured clinical metadata. It is designed to support research in medical imaging, radiomics, artificial intelligence, and multi-modal learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical, especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set. To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape, particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk prediction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but, when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired, diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias. Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03232v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However, existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be released after acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03245v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03255v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on 54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%), indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos, the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset design toolbox for medical imaging.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation. Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers, simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec 3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative 2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding. To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences. In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient and superior performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03317v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches. Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple, model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Diffusion-SDPO.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03325v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations, ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness. Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models, particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore, this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module, which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation, video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M), UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03367v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

In this work, we propose an automated method for standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived. The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images, PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%, 95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings.

We propose a principled extension of SfT that enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces, thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03589v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous, interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age, height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms -- across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny, showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for human-centric 3D modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03645v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset. In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and two-dimensional biomedical signals.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03665v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals. These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference. Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior methods, achieving the new state of the art.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However, existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 -- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While prior work on group recommender systems (GRSs) has primarily focused on improving recommendation accuracy, most approaches assume static or predefined groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic, real-world scenarios. We reframe group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality, efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02886v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on 4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model, not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02887v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The North Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, represents a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities, yet fishermen often face uncertainty in locating productive fishing grounds. To address this challenge, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs) using oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The approach is designed to enhance the accuracy of PFZ identification and provide region-specific insights for sustainable fishing practices. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can support fishermen by reducing search time, lowering fuel consumption, and promoting efficient resource utilization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02894v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems. Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting, whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives. These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable IoT systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02936v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02944v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret. We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs, our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with statistical validity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02966v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign in achieving personalized alignment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI) within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly, without introducing extra hyperparameters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials. Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells. Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03015v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete, unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models, leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally, in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation. Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users. In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless'' monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48 million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$ 2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$ 7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs 3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs 10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03032v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example, we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization -- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm, Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized "search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization across linked factors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity: the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly nonlinear relationships outperform simpler approaches in financial forecasting. While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial time series forecasting, the application of transformer models for options data remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction for model development.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03047v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in enterprise applications where AI agents and humans engage in objective-driven interactions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate: data may be complex and unlabeled; human annotation is often impractical at scale; custom metrics can monitor for specific errors, but not previously-undetected ones; and LLM judges can produce unreliable results. We introduce the first set of unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions, leveraging statistical properties of unlabeled interaction data and using fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to distributional shifts. We develop metrics for labeling user goals, measuring goal completion, and quantifying LLM uncertainty without grounding evaluations in human-generated ideal responses. Our approach is validated on open-domain and task-specific interaction data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature. To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable, meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm attention-induced curvature.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: For far too long, expressivity of graph neural networks has been measured \emph{only} in terms of combinatorial properties. In this work we stray away from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset.   These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to new frontiers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03074v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks. This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time. This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value. Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled, causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data, creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony; locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal, anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03100v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management, co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems. However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles. Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal. Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39% higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.

The field of text analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this paper.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While backpropagation--reverse-mode automatic differentiation--has been extraordinarily successful in deep learning, it requires two passes (forward and backward) through the neural network and the storage of intermediate activations. Existing gradient estimation methods that instead use forward-mode automatic differentiation struggle to scale beyond small networks due to the high variance of the estimates. Efforts to mitigate this have so far introduced significant bias to the estimates, reducing their utility. We introduce a gradient estimation approach that reduces both bias and variance by manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions. It shows promising results and has the potential to scale to larger networks, indeed performing better as the network width is increased. Our understanding of this method is facilitated by analyses of bias and variance, and their connection to the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework. Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without relying on additional modules.

However, when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's robustness. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Shukti042/AdversarialExample.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03148v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration (AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data distributions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03149v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast, pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly (F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates. By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction. Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is fundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static causal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where relationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics requires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning method for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler and Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic representations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive Dependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human motion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying, time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03187v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks -- particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space, thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's repertoire.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03190v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications, including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g., electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CMCM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03197v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution. Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Urban flooding is expected to increase in frequency and severity as a consequence of climate change, causing wide-ranging impacts that include a decrease in urban Quality of Life (QoL). Meanwhile, policymakers must devise adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning (RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning strategies. Our framework is publicly available: https://github.com/MLSM-at-DTU/maat_qol_framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03239v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC} produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the core of data-centric AI.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs. This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across computational science domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Climate change will cause an increase in the frequency and severity of flood events, prompting the need for cohesive adaptation policymaking. Designing effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g. economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can alter adaptation policy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03251v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning, yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects: cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC) penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM, and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation; input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms, such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction. Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method, with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual interventions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency. Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC, Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression -- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR) provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in comparisons to other contemporary methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sparse decision tree learning provides accurate and interpretable predictive models that are ideal for high-stakes applications by finding the single most accurate tree within a (soft) size limit. Rather than relying on a single "best" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard, enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior. Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered) objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more practical in real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03363v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35% and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98% gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information, traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents without costly manual labelling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03368v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rise of the machine learning (ML) model economy has intertwined markets for training datasets and pre-trained models. However, most pricing approaches still separate data and model transactions or rely on broker-centric pipelines that favor one side. Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence, uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with broker-centric and one-sided baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03405v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical search problems. However, the original method of training the network with simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER (\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of pure supervised or reinforcement learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03464v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Integrating different molecular layers, i.e., multiomics data, is crucial for unraveling the complexity of diseases; yet, most deep generative models either prioritize predictive performance at the expense of interpretability or enforce interpretability by linearizing the decoder, thereby weakening the network's nonlinear expressiveness. To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS: Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder. In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations, demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist in multiomics representation learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI), which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with retrieved context but often suffers from downgraded prefill performance as modern applications demand longer and more complex inputs. Existing caching techniques either preserve accuracy with low cache reuse or improve reuse at the cost of degraded reasoning quality. We present RAGBoost, an efficient RAG system that achieves high cache reuse without sacrificing accuracy through accuracy-preserving context reuse. RAGBoost detects overlapping retrieved items across concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions, using efficient context indexing, ordering, and de-duplication to maximize reuse, while lightweight contextual hints maintain reasoning fidelity. It integrates seamlessly with existing LLM inference engines and improves their prefill performance by 1.5-3X over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving or even enhancing reasoning accuracy across diverse RAG and agentic AI workloads.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal, occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites. Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other multimodal physiological applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03492v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to resolve a central paradox in modern machine learning: When is it better to use less data? This question has become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions, small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03527v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting (gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes. These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to learned value functions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private data. However, the presence of malicious (Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL, particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data and a large proportion of malicious clients.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network (ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters. Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned, thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03548v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central goal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima, which have been consistently associated with improved generalization performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with a non-negative, $\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur trivial $\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally. Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural ''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021), designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate, the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\Omega(1)$, indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also incur population risk $\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03565v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open directions for future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed text, numeric, and categorical fields. We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit within a 128k-token window.   On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03578v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations, but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10% computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems, CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy. Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior an intrinsic property of the learning process.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03595v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning. This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature. HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset sizes and hyperparameter configurations.

The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/rl-theory-in-lean.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have revolutionized predictive machine learning for tabular data. At the same time, the driving factors of this revolution are hard to understand. Existing open-source tabular foundation models are implemented in complicated pipelines boasting over 10,000 lines of code, lack architecture documentation or code quality. In short, the implementations are hard to understand, not beginner-friendly, and complicated to adapt for new experiments. We introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified and lightweight implementation of the TabPFN v2 architecture and a corresponding training loop that uses pre-generated training data. nanoTabPFN makes tabular foundation models more accessible to students and researchers alike. For example, restricted to a small data setting it achieves a performance comparable to traditional machine learning baselines within one minute of pre-training on a single GPU (160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining). This eliminated requirement of large computational resources makes pre-training tabular foundation models accessible for educational purposes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning (XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively. LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy. GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC. These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches, minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven healthcare solutions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03670v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a detailed study of Deep Q-Networks in finite environments, emphasizing the impact of epsilon-greedy exploration schedules and prioritized experience replay. Through systematic experimentation, we evaluate how variations in epsilon decay schedules affect learning efficiency, convergence behavior, and reward optimization. We investigate how prioritized experience replay leads to faster convergence and higher returns and show empirical results comparing uniform, no replay, and prioritized strategies across multiple simulations. Our findings illuminate the trade-offs and interactions between exploration strategies and memory management in DQN training, offering practical recommendations for robust reinforcement learning in resource-constrained settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03685v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling implementations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that (i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03697v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.   Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy -- particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols, including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36 LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03070v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications. Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time, classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions, challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer 1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional (Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also limited.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03106v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches, inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss. We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach. Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language, formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements, and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03137v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on many problem instances.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03138v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios. This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03179v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03235v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 > 0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities.

While WCAG-EM offers a structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03724v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02937v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications, agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However, existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique challenges of agricultural applications.   Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework, which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness and consistency.   Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.02994v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: For developing safe Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), rigorous testing is required before they are deemed safe for road deployments. Since comprehensive conventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns, Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing VTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong indication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this work explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation metrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The metrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise, density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing the metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best across all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing Environment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in a controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle equipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from the VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans were compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and simulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU of 21\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance (DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties of simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model outputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be the most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings requires a paradigm that combines human expertise with AI-driven analysis, especially when anomalies are unforeseen. We introduce AURA (Autonomous Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity digital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to anomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear roles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors telemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem description, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a knowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing on external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new training examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback loop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from a static tool into an adaptive partner. We describe the framework's operating principles and provide a concrete implementation, establishing a pattern for trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robots must understand their environment from raw sensory inputs and reason about the consequences of their actions in it to solve complex tasks. Behavior Cloning (BC) leverages task-specific human demonstrations to learn this knowledge as end-to-end policies. However, these policies are difficult to transfer to new tasks, and generating training data is challenging because it requires careful demonstrations and frequent environment resets. In contrast to such policy-based view, in this paper we take a model-based approach where we collect a few hours of unstructured easy-to-collect play data to learn an action-conditioned visual world model, a diffusion-based action sampler, and optionally a reward model. The world model -- in combination with the action sampler and a reward model -- is then used to optimize long sequences of actions with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. The resulting plans are executed on the robot via a zeroth-order Model Predictive Controller (MPC). We show that the action sampler mitigates hallucinations of the world model during planning and validate our approach on 3 real-world robotic tasks with varying levels of planning and modeling complexity. Our experiments support the hypothesis that planning leads to a significant improvement over BC baselines on a standard manipulation test environment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03078v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a key role in enabling dexterous and reliable robotic manipulation, but realizing this capability requires substantial calibration to convert raw sensor readings into physically meaningful quantities. Despite its near-universal necessity, the calibration process remains ad hoc and labor-intensive. Here, we introduce \libname{}, an open-source library that transforms a low-cost 3D printer into an automated probing device capable of generating large volumes of labeled training data for tactile sensor calibration. We demonstrate the utility of \libname{} by calibrating two commercially available vision-based tactile sensors, DIGIT and GelSight Mini, to reconstruct high-quality depth maps using the collected data and a custom convolutional neural network. In addition, we perform a data ablation study to determine how much data is needed for accurate calibration, providing practical guidelines for researchers working with these specific sensors, and we benchmark the trained models on previously unseen objects to evaluate calibration accuracy and generalization performance. By automating tactile sensor calibration, \libname{} can accelerate tactile sensing research, simplify sensor deployment, and promote the practical integration of tactile sensing in robotic platforms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03165v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce SENT-Map, a semantically enhanced topological map for representing indoor environments, designed to support autonomous navigation and manipulation by leveraging advancements in foundational models (FMs). Through representing the environment in a JSON text format, we enable semantic information to be added and edited in a format that both humans and FMs understand, while grounding the robot to existing nodes during planning to avoid infeasible states during deployment. Our proposed framework employs a two stage approach, first mapping the environment alongside an operator with a Vision-FM, then using the SENT-Map representation alongside a natural-language query within an FM for planning. Our experimental results show that semantic-enhancement enables even small locally-deployable FMs to successfully plan over indoor environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability to navigate complex terrains with their multiple legs interacting with the environment. However, how to effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real hexapod robot.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03181v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper, bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper. Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly wrapped package with clean folds and no tears.   We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than merely replicating motion sequences.   Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object manipulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our proposed approach compared to admittance control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects, adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient. Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive robots.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03481v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications, yet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and coordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge. Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability, and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7 passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight 1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%, significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps, successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation tasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous hands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation and intelligent manufacturing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03497v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space). Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.

We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity. OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and (iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/MasterHow/OneOcc.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03576v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03591v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03622v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard, even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search. Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected orthogonal search area.

Addressing the dual challenges of maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications. We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications of robotics in creative fields.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03652v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses a motion planning problem to achieve spatio-temporal-logical tasks, expressed by syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic specifications (scLTL\next), in uncertain environments. Here, the uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic labels of the environment. For example, the task is "first go to region 1, then go to region 2"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known a priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel automata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed to capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is designed for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm utilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical results and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03676v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study investigates how human motion cues can be used to design expressive robot-arm movements. Using the imperfect-information game Geister, we analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay (unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based on these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two presentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results indicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays an important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances the interpretability of motion cues.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2511.03691v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers typically depend on external sources, which limit portability and long-term autonomy. This work introduces a self-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through internal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through chambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced liquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling stable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The internal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping pressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new possibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in soft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific sampling and operation in underwater and field environments.
