- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00051v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models aim to endow AI systems with the ability to represent, generate, and interact with dynamic environments in a coherent and temporally consistent manner. While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00090v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary text-to-image models exhibit a surprising degree of mode collapse, as can be seen when sampling several images given the same text prompt. While previous work has attempted to address this issue by steering the model using guidance mechanisms, or by generating a large pool of candidates and refining them, in this work we take a different direction and aim for diversity in generations via noise optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model. We also analyze the frequency characteristics of the noise and show that alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles can improve both optimization and search. Our experiments demonstrate that noise optimization yields superior results in terms of generation quality and variety.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 4D spatial intelligence involves perceiving and processing how objects move or change over time. Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning. We hope that the findings provided in this work offer valuable insights to the community and that our benchmark can facilitate the development of more capable MLLMs toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

- **标题**: A Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network for multimodal post-flood water extent mapping using SAR and incomplete multispectral data
- **作者**: Hyunho Lee, Wenwen Li

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00123v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mapping water extent during a flood event is essential for effective disaster management throughout all phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing water extent mapping using deep learning models. This approach is particularly beneficial when timely post-flood observations, acquired during or shortly after the flood peak, are limited, as it enables the use of all available imagery for more accurate post-flood water extent mapping. However, the adaptive integration of partially available MSI data into the SAR-based post-flood water extent mapping process remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet), a multimodal deep learning model that utilizes SAR data as the primary input for post-flood water extent mapping and integrates complementary MSI data through feature fusion. In experiments on the C2S-MS Floods dataset, SMAGNet consistently outperformed other multimodal deep learning models in prediction performance across varying levels of MSI data availability. Furthermore, we found that even when MSI data were completely missing, the performance of SMAGNet remained statistically comparable to that of a U-Net model trained solely on SAR data. These findings indicate that SMAGNet enhances the model robustness to missing data as well as the applicability of multimodal deep learning in real-world flood management scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human drivers rarely travel where no person has gone before. After all, thousands of drivers use busy city roads every day, and only one can claim to be the first. The same holds for autonomous computer vision systems. The vast majority of the deployment area of an autonomous vision system will have been visited before. Yet, most autonomous vehicle vision systems act as if they are encountering each location for the first time. In this work, we present Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a simple but effective framework to learn spatial priors from historic traversals. The map priors use a binarized hashmap that requires only $32\text{KB}/\text{km}^2$, a $20\times$ reduction compared to the dense storage. Compressed Map Priors easily integrate into leading 3D perception systems at little to no extra computational costs, and lead to a significant and consistent improvement in 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset across several architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00141v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI has made AI-generated images increasingly realistic and high-resolution. Most AI-generated image detection architectures typically downsample images before inputting them into models, risking the loss of fine-grained details. This paper presents GLASS (Global-Local Attention with Stratified Sampling), an architecture that combines a globally resized view with multiple randomly sampled local crops. These crops are original-resolution regions efficiently selected through spatially stratified sampling and aggregated using attention-based scoring. GLASS can be integrated into vision models to leverage both global and local information in images of any size. Vision Transformer, ResNet, and ConvNeXt models are used as backbones, and experiments show that GLASS outperforms standard transfer learning by achieving higher predictive performance within feasible computational constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00150v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00156v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an underexplored problem in facial analysis: generating and recognizing multi-attribute natural language descriptions, containing facial action units (AUs), emotional states, and age estimation, for arbitrarily selected face regions (termed FaceFocalDesc). We argue that the system's ability to focus on individual facial areas leads to better understanding and control. To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics. This fully verifies its effectiveness and versatility in fine-grained multi-attribute face region-focal analysis scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00194v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recovering the in-air colours of seafloor from satellite imagery is a challenging task due to the exponential attenuation of light with depth in the water column. In this study, we present DichroGAN, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) designed for this purpose. DichroGAN employs a two-steps simultaneous training: first, two generators utilise a hyperspectral image cube to estimate diffuse and specular reflections, thereby obtaining atmospheric scene radiance. Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission. These generators work together to remove the effects of light absorption and scattering, restoring the in-air colours of seafloor based on the underwater image formation equation. DichroGAN is trained on a compact dataset derived from PRISMA satellite imagery, comprising RGB images paired with their corresponding spectral bands and masks. Extensive experiments on both satellite and underwater datasets demonstrate that DichroGAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art underwater restoration techniques.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00207v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rigorous crop counting is crucial for effective agricultural management and informed intervention strategies. However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image-level domain alignment is the de facto approach for unsupervised domain adaptation, where unpaired image translation is used to minimize the domain gap. Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting reasoning chains before generating final answers. However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information. This limits their ability to solve problems that demand accurate visual perception, such as visual puzzles. We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7.   To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision. We design and evaluate six reward functions targeting different reasoning aspects, including image understanding, thinking steps, and answer accuracy. Using group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly incentivizes longer, structured reasoning and mitigates bypassing of visual information. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-VL-7B achieve 5.56% improvements over the base model, with consistent gains across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a prevalent and fundamental technique that discretizes continuous feature vectors by approximating them using a codebook. As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00225v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) has advanced significantly through deep learning, but the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets remains a challenge. While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/Li-aobo/SynDR-IQA.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00237v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of infrared (IR) data scarcity in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) defect detection by proposing a cross-modal data augmentation framework integrating CycleGAN and YOLOv8. Unlike conventional methods relying on paired supervision, we leverage CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, mapping abundant visible-light PCB images into the infrared domain. This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective pest management is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity, especially for crops such as sugarcane and wheat that are highly vulnerable to pest infestations. Traditional pest management methods depend heavily on manual field inspections and the use of chemical pesticides. These approaches are often costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can have a negative impact on the environment. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a lightweight framework for pest detection and pesticide recommendation, designed for low-resource devices such as smartphones and drones, making it suitable for use by small and marginal farmers.   The proposed framework includes two main components. The first is a Pest Detection Module that uses a compact, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with prototypical meta-learning to accurately identify pests even when only a few training samples are available. The second is a Pesticide Recommendation Module that incorporates environmental factors like crop type and growth stage to suggest safe and eco-friendly pesticide recommendations. To train and evaluate our framework, a comprehensive pest image dataset was developed by combining multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset contains samples with different viewing angles, pest sizes, and background conditions to ensure strong generalization.   Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight CNN achieves high accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing computational complexity. The Decision Support System additionally improves pest management by reducing dependence on traditional chemical pesticides and encouraging sustainable practices, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications in precision agriculture.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While foundation models in radiology are expected to be applied to various clinical tasks, computational cost constraints remain a major challenge when training on 3D-CT volumetric data. In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal learning has revolutionized general domain tasks, yet its application in scientific discovery is hindered by the profound semantic gap between complex scientific imagery and sparse textual descriptions. We present S1-MMAlign, a large-scale, multi-disciplinary multimodal dataset comprising over 15.5 million high-quality image-text pairs derived from 2.5 million open-access scientific papers. Spanning disciplines from physics and biology to engineering, the dataset captures diverse visual modalities including experimental setups, heatmaps, and microscopic imagery. To address the pervasive issue of weak alignment in raw scientific captions, we introduce an AI-ready semantic enhancement pipeline that utilizes the Qwen-VL multimodal large model series to recaption images by synthesizing context from paper abstracts and citation contexts. Technical validation demonstrates that this enhancement significantly improves data quality: SciBERT-based pseudo-perplexity metrics show reduced semantic ambiguity, while CLIP scores indicate an 18.21% improvement in image-text alignment. S1-MMAlign provides a foundational resource for advancing scientific reasoning and cross-modal understanding in the era of AI for Science. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScienceOne-AI/S1-MMAlign.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation capabilities, yet they raise significant concerns regarding safety, copyright, and ethical implications. Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability. Our approach also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, establishing a new plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight yet effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00269v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-Tailed distributions are pervasive in remote sensing due to the inherently imbalanced occurrence of grounded objects. However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked, i.e., disentangling hard tail data samples from noisy ambiguous ones. Conventional methods often indiscriminately emphasize all low-confidence samples, leading to overfitting on noisy data. To bridge this gap, building upon Evidential Deep Learning, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware framework termed DUAL, which dynamically disentangles prediction uncertainty into Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) and Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU). Specifically, we introduce EU as an indicator of sample scarcity to guide a reweighting strategy for hard-to-learn tail samples, while leveraging AU to quantify data ambiguity, employing an adaptive label smoothing mechanism to suppress the impact of noise. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework, surpassing strong baselines such as TGN and SADE. Ablation studies provide further insights into the crucial choices of our design.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing a dynamic target moving over a large area is challenging. Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As dermatological conditions become increasingly common and the availability of dermatologists remains limited, there is a growing need for intelligent tools to support both patients and clinicians in the timely and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases. In this project, we developed a deep learning based model for the classification and diagnosis of skin conditions. By leveraging pretraining on publicly available skin disease image datasets, our model effectively extracted visual features and accurately classified various dermatological cases. Throughout the project, we refined the model architecture, optimized data preprocessing workflows, and applied targeted data augmentation techniques to improve overall performance. The final model, based on the Swin Transformer, achieved a prediction accuracy of 87.71 percent across eight skin lesion classes on the ISIC2019 dataset. These results demonstrate the model's potential as a diagnostic support tool for clinicians and a self assessment aid for patients.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most colorization models condition only on a single reference, typically the first frame of the scene. However, this approach ignores other sources of conditional data, such as character sheets, background images, or arbitrary colorized frames. We propose TimeColor, a sketch-based video colorization model that supports heterogeneous, variable-count references with the use of explicit per-reference region assignment. TimeColor encodes references as additional latent frames which are concatenated temporally, permitting them to be processed concurrently in each diffusion step while keeping the model's parameter count fixed. TimeColor also uses spatiotemporal correspondence-masked attention to enforce subject-reference binding in addition to modality-disjoint RoPE indexing. These mechanisms mitigate shortcutting and cross-identity palette leakage. Experiments on SAKUGA-42M under both single- and multi-reference protocols show that TimeColor improves color fidelity, identity consistency, and temporal stability over prior baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is an extremely important area in both surveillance and mobile applications, requiring strong accuracy with minimal computational cost. State-of-the-art methods give good accuracy but with high computational budgets. To remedy this, this paper proposes VisNet, a computationally efficient and effective re-identification model suitable for real-world scenarios. It is the culmination of conceptual contributions, including feature fusion at multiple scales with automatic attention on each, semantic clustering with anatomical body partitioning, a dynamic weight averaging technique to balance classification semantic regularization, and the use of loss function FIDI for improved metric learning tasks. The multiple scales fuse ResNet50's stages 1 through 4 without the use of parallel paths, with semantic clustering introducing spatial constraints through the use of rule-based pseudo-labeling. VisNet achieves 87.05% Rank-1 and 77.65% mAP on the Market-1501 dataset, having 32.41M parameters and 4.601 GFLOPs, hence, proposing a practical approach for real-time deployment in surveillance and mobile applications where computational resources are limited.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video behavior recognition demands stable and discriminative representations under complex spatiotemporal variations. However, prevailing data augmentation strategies for videos remain largely perturbation-driven, often introducing uncontrolled variations that amplify non-discriminative factors, which finally weaken intra-class distributional structure and representation drift with inconsistent gains across temporal scales. To address these problems, we propose Representation-aware Mixing Augmentation (ReMA), a plug-and-play augmentation strategy that formulates mixing as a controlled replacement process to expand representations while preserving class-conditional stability. ReMA integrates two complementary mechanisms. Firstly, the Representation Alignment Mechanism (RAM) performs structured intra-class mixing under distributional alignment constraints, suppressing irrelevant intra-class drift while enhancing statistical reliability. Then, the Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) generates motion-aware spatiotemporal masks to localize perturbations, guiding them away from discrimination-sensitive regions and promoting temporal coherence. By jointly controlling how and where mixing is applied, ReMA improves representation robustness without additional supervision or trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on diverse video behavior benchmarks demonstrate that ReMA consistently enhances generalization and robustness across different spatiotemporal granularities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image reflection separation aims to disentangle the transmission layer and the reflection layer from a blended image. Existing methods rely on limited information from a single image, tending to confuse the two layers when their contrasts are similar, a challenge more severe at night. To address this issue, we propose the Depth-Memory Decoupling Network (DMDNet). It employs the Depth-Aware Scanning (DAScan) to guide Mamba toward salient structures, promoting information flow along semantic coherence to construct stable states. Working in synergy with DAScan, the Depth-Synergized State-Space Model (DS-SSM) modulates the sensitivity of state activations by depth, suppressing the spread of ambiguous features that interfere with layer disentanglement. Furthermore, we introduce the Memory Expert Compensation Module (MECM), leveraging cross-image historical knowledge to guide experts in providing layer-specific compensation. To address the lack of datasets for nighttime reflection separation, we construct the Nighttime Image Reflection Separation (NightIRS) dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both daytime and nighttime.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in industrial product quality inspection. Failing to detect tiny defects often leads to serious consequences. Existing methods face a structure-semantics trade-off: structure-oriented models (such as frequency-based filters) are noise-sensitive, while semantics-oriented models (such as CLIP-based encoders) often miss fine details. To address this, we propose HarmoniAD, a frequency-guided dual-branch framework. Features are first extracted by the CLIP image encoder, then transformed into the frequency domain, and finally decoupled into high- and low-frequency paths for complementary modeling of structure and semantics. The high-frequency branch is equipped with a fine-grained structural attention module (FSAM) to enhance textures and edges for detecting small anomalies, while the low-frequency branch uses a global structural context module (GSCM) to capture long-range dependencies and preserve semantic consistency. Together, these branches balance fine detail and global semantics. HarmoniAD further adopts a multi-class joint training strategy, and experiments on MVTec-AD, VisA, and BTAD show state-of-the-art performance with both sensitivity and robustness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00328v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving consistent and high-fidelity geometry and appearance reconstruction of 3D digital humans from a single RGB image is inherently a challenging task. Existing studies typically resort to decoupled pipelines for geometry estimation and appearance synthesis, often hindering unified reconstruction and causing inconsistencies. This paper introduces \textbf{JGA-LBD}, a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and appearance into a joint latent representation and formulates the generation process as bridge diffusion. Observing that directly integrating heterogeneous input conditions (e.g., depth maps, SMPL models) leads to substantial training difficulties, we unify all conditions into the 3D Gaussian representations, which can be further compressed into a unified latent space through a shared sparse variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the specialized form of bridge diffusion enables to start with a partial observation of the target latent code and solely focuses on inferring the missing components. Finally, a dedicated decoding module extracts the complete 3D human geometric structure and renders novel views from the inferred latent representation. Experiments demonstrate that JGA-LBD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both geometry fidelity and appearance quality, including challenging in-the-wild scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/haiantyz/JGA-LBD.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speeding is a major contributor to road fatalities, particularly in developing countries such as Uganda, where road safety infrastructure is limited. This study proposes a real-time intelligent traffic surveillance system tailored to such regions, using computer vision techniques to address vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and speed estimation. The study collected a rich dataset using a speed gun, a Canon Camera, and a mobile phone to train the models. License plate detection using YOLOv8 achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.9%. For character recognition of the detected license plate, the CNN model got a character error rate (CER) of 3.85%, while the transformer model significantly reduced the CER to 1.79%. Speed estimation used source and target regions of interest, yielding a good performance of 10 km/h margin of error. Additionally, a database was established to correlate user information with vehicle detection data, enabling automated ticket issuance via SMS via Africa's Talking API. This system addresses critical traffic management needs in resource-constrained environments and shows potential to reduce road accidents through automated traffic enforcement in developing countries where such interventions are urgently needed.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual-tactile learning (VTL) enables embodied agents to perceive the physical world by integrating visual (VIS) and tactile (TAC) sensors. However, VTL still suffers from modality discrepancies between VIS and TAC images, as well as domain gaps caused by non-standardized tactile sensors and inconsistent data collection procedures. We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior cross-domain generalization performance of OmniVaT on the SDG-VTL task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In domestic environments, robots require a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings to interact effectively and intuitively with untrained humans. In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Additionally, we show qualitative results that highlight the effectiveness and possible use cases in real-world applications. Overall, our method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional segmentation approaches while enabling flexible natural-language querying and seamless integration into 3D mapping pipelines for mobile robotics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00368v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a lightweight two-stage framework for joint geometry and color inpainting of damaged 3D objects, motivated by the digital restoration of cultural heritage artifacts. The pipeline separates damage localization from reconstruction. In the first stage, a 2D convolutional network predicts damage masks on RGB slices extracted from a voxelized object, and these predictions are aggregated into a volumetric mask. In the second stage, a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting directly on voxel grids, reconstructing geometry and color while preserving observed regions. The model jointly predicts occupancy and color using a composite objective that combines occupancy reconstruction with masked color reconstruction and perceptual regularization. We evaluate the approach on a curated set of textured artifacts with synthetically generated damage using standard geometric and color metrics. Compared to symmetry-based baselines, our method produces more complete geometry and more coherent color reconstructions at a fixed 32^3 resolution. Overall, the results indicate that explicit mask conditioning is a practical way to guide volumetric diffusion models for joint 3D geometry and color inpainting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable progress with graph-based architectures. However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00398v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Roadside litter poses environmental, safety and economic challenges, yet current monitoring relies on labour-intensive surveys and public reporting, providing limited spatial coverage. Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies. RoLID-11K establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme small-object detection in dynamic driving scenes and aims to support the development of scalable, low-cost systems for roadside-litter monitoring.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00422v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of AI technologies has accelerated the development of smart factories. In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset. Specifically, it improved the estimation accuracy by 1.3% and reduced misclassification between adjacent tasks by 1.9% in the desktop PC dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce CPPO, a Contrastive Perception Policy Optimization method for finetuning vision-language models (VLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately simulating existing 3D objects and a wide variety of materials often demands expert knowledge and time-consuming physical parameter tuning to achieve the desired dynamic behavior. We introduce MotionPhysics, an end-to-end differentiable framework that infers plausible physical parameters from a user-provided natural language prompt for a chosen 3D scene of interest, removing the need for guidance from ground-truth trajectories or annotated videos. Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We demonstrate that MotionPhysics produces visually realistic dynamic simulations guided by natural language, surpassing the state of the art while automatically determining physically plausible parameters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clean images from diverse unknown degradations using a single model. But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Friskknight/ORCANet-SEUD.

We propose \textbf{FreeText}, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that improves text rendering by exploiting intrinsic mechanisms of \emph{Diffusion Transformer (DiT)} models. \textbf{FreeText} decomposes the problem into \emph{where to write} and \emph{what to write}. For \emph{where to write}, we localize writing regions by reading token-wise spatial attribution from endogenous image-to-text attention, using sink-like tokens as stable spatial anchors and topology-aware refinement to produce high-confidence masks. For \emph{what to write}, we introduce Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI), which injects a noise-aligned glyph prior with frequency-domain band-pass modulation to strengthen glyph structure and suppress semantic leakage (rendering the concept instead of the word). Extensive experiments on Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, and SD3 variants across longText-Benchmark, CVTG, and our CLT-Bench show consistent gains in text readability while largely preserving semantic alignment and aesthetic quality, with modest inference overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its remarkable zero-shot segmentation capabilities, has garnered significant attention in the community. Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations. It is designed to make the model learn more robust VNS features and comprehensively benchmark the model's segmentation performance and generalizability on VNS scenarios. Extensive experiments across various VNS segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VNS-SAM, particularly under zero-shot settings, highlighting its potential for broad real-world applications. Codes and datasets are publicly available at https://guangqian-guo.github.io/VNS-SAM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00542v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To achieve pixel-level image manipulation, drag-style image editing which edits images using points or trajectories as conditions is attracting widespread attention. Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues. Other methods under different frameworks suffer from various problems like the huge gap between source image and target edited image as well as unreasonable intermediate point which can lead to low editability. To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively. In each iteration, Motion Prediction first predicts where the handle points should move, and then Motion Supervision drags them accordingly. We also propose to dynamically adjust the valid handle points to further improve the performance. Experiments on face and human datasets showcase the superiority over previous works.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00551v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-quality three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is gaining increasing attention in clinical applications. To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and in vivo mouse experiments, and the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG_Pro.

These tools drive innovation but also enable the spread of misleading content, false information, and manipulated media. As generated images become harder to distinguish from photographs, detecting them has become an urgent priority. To combat this challenge, We release MS COCOAI, a novel dataset for AI generated image detection consisting of 96000 real and synthetic datapoints, built using the MS COCO dataset. To generate synthetic images, we use five generators: Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, DALL-E 3, and MidJourney v6. Based on the dataset, we propose two tasks: (1) classifying images as real or generated, and (2) identifying which model produced a given synthetic image.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00561v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The capability of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) to apply world knowledge across diverse tasks remains a critical, unresolved challenge. Existing benchmarks fall short, offering only siloed, single-task evaluations with limited diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose AEGIS (\emph{i.e.}, \textbf{A}ssessing \textbf{E}diting, \textbf{G}eneration, \textbf{I}nterpretation-Understanding for \textbf{S}uper-intelligence), a comprehensive multi-task benchmark covering visual understanding, generation, editing, and interleaved generation. AEGIS comprises 1,050 challenging, manually-annotated questions spanning 21 topics (including STEM, humanities, daily life, etc.) and 6 reasoning types. To concretely evaluate the performance of UMMs in world knowledge scope without ambiguous metrics, we further propose Deterministic Checklist-based Evaluation (DCE), a protocol that replaces ambiguous prompt-based scoring with atomic ``Y/N'' judgments, to enhance evaluation reliability. Our extensive experiments reveal that most UMMs exhibit severe world knowledge deficits and that performance degrades significantly with complex reasoning. Additionally, simple plug-in reasoning modules can partially mitigate these vulnerabilities, highlighting a promising direction for future research. These results highlight the importance of world-knowledge-based reasoning as a critical frontier for UMMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00562v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual perception plays a pivotal role in enabling autonomous behavior, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to complex multi-sensor systems. However, robust segmentation remains a challenge in complex scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes a cascaded convolutional neural network integrated with a novel Global Information Guidance Module. This module is designed to effectively fuse low-level texture details with high-level semantic features across multiple layers, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of single-scale feature extraction. This architectural innovation significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, particularly in visually cluttered or blurred environments where traditional methods often fail. Experimental evaluations on benchmark image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior precision, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of the approach and its promising potential for deployment in practical robotic applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot video moment retrieval (ZVMR) is the task of localizing a temporal moment within an untrimmed video using a natural language query without relying on task-specific training data. The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches. As a result, our method sets a new state-of-the-art across all three major benchmarks (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions), with a notable 3.23% mAP@avg improvement on the challenging QVHighlights dataset.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00590v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-motion (T2M) generation with diffusion backbones achieves strong realism and alignment. Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00598v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: RGB-Infrared (RGB-IR) multimodal perception is fundamental to embodied multimedia systems operating in complex physical environments. Although recent cross-modal fusion methods have advanced RGB-IR detection, the optimization dynamics caused by asymmetric modality characteristics remain underexplored. In practice, disparities in information density and feature quality introduce persistent optimization bias, leading training to overemphasize a dominant modality and hindering effective fusion. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution. Based on MDI, we develop a Modality Dominance-Aware Cross-modal Learning (MDACL) framework that regulates cross-modal optimization. MDACL incorporates Hierarchical Cross-modal Guidance (HCG) to enhance feature alignment and Adversarial Equilibrium Regularization (AER) to balance optimization dynamics during fusion. Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR benchmarks demonstrate that MDACL effectively mitigates optimization bias and achieves SOTA performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant advances in generic object detection, a persistent performance gap remains for tiny objects compared to normal-scale objects. We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting. To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training. Extensive experiments across three datasets validate our approach's effectiveness. Especially, TOLF boosts the DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on the AI-TOD dataset.

It is capable of real-time monitoring and evaluation of patients'motion during rehabilitation, providing immediate feedback and guidance to assist patients in executing rehabilitation exercises correctly. Firstly, we introduce a unified pipeline for end-to-end real-time human pose estimation and motion analysis using RGB video input from multiple cameras which can be applied to the field of rehabilitation training. The pipeline can help to monitor and correct patients'actions, thus aiding them in regaining muscle strength and motor functions. Secondly, we propose a fast tracking method for medical rehabilitation scenarios with multiple-person interference, which requires less than 1ms for tracking for a single frame. Additionally, we modify SmoothNet for real-time posture estimation, effectively reducing pose estimation errors and restoring the patient's true motion state, making it visually smoother. Finally, we use Unity platform for real-time monitoring and evaluation of patients' motion during rehabilitation, and to display the muscle stress conditions to assist patients with their rehabilitation training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preoperative prognosis of Ependymoma is critical for treatment planning but challenging due to the lack of semantic insights in MRI compared to post-operative surgical reports. Existing multimodal methods fail to leverage this privileged text data when it is unavailable during inference. To bridge this gap, we propose HyperPriv-EPN, a hypergraph-based Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data). Through dual-stream distillation, the Student learns to hallucinate semantic community structures from visual features alone. Validated on a multi-center cohort of 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification. This effectively transfers expert knowledge to the preoperative setting, unlocking the value of historical post-operative data to guide the diagnosis of new patients without requiring text at inference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00645v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image-based deep learning provides a non-invasive, scalable solution for monitoring potato quality during storage, addressing key challenges such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction. In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability. Overall, this approach offers a cost-effective, non-destructive method for quality assessment, supporting efficiency and sustainability in potato storage and distribution.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00658v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable building height estimation is essential for various urban applications. Spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) provides weather-independent, side-looking observations that capture facade-level structure, offering a promising alternative to conventional optical methods. However, TomoSAR point clouds often suffer from noise, anisotropic point distributions, and data voids on incoherent surfaces, all of which hinder accurate height reconstruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a learning-based framework for converting raw TomoSAR points into high-resolution building height maps. Our dual-topology network alternates between a point branch that models irregular scatterer features and a grid branch that enforces spatial consistency. By jointly processing these representations, the network denoises the input points and inpaints missing regions to produce continuous height estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept for large-scale urban height mapping directly from TomoSAR point clouds. Extensive experiments on data from Munich and Berlin validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to incorporate optical satellite imagery, further enhancing reconstruction quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00659v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use. Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans excel at forecasting the future dynamics of a scene given just a single image. Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00703v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20\%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00716v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated strong potential in medical image analysis and disease diagnosis. However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep neural networks show great potential for automating various visual quality inspection tasks in manufacturing. However, their applicability is limited in more volatile scenarios, such as remanufacturing, where the inspected products and defect patterns often change. In such settings, deployed models require frequent adaptation to novel conditions, effectively posing a continual learning problem. To enable quick adaptation, the necessary training processes must be computationally efficient while still avoiding effects like catastrophic forgetting. This work presents a multi-level feature fusion (MLFF) approach that aims to improve both aspects simultaneously by utilizing representations from different depths of a pretrained network. We show that our approach is able to match the performance of end-to-end training for different quality inspection problems while using significantly less trainable parameters. Furthermore, it reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves generalization robustness to new product types or defects.

We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\approx$17% at $D_{\max}=40$. Ablations show that trivial prompting and removing the reference solution substantially degrade accuracy and introduce systematic over-grading, confirming that structured prompting and reference grounding are essential.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00759v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structured shape completion recovers missing geometry as primitives rather than as unstructured points, which enables primitive-based surface reconstruction. Instead of following the prevailing cascade, we rethink how primitives and points should interact, and find it more effective to decode primitives in a dedicated pathway that attends to shared shape features. Following this principle, we present UniCo, which in a single feed-forward pass predicts a set of primitives with complete geometry, semantics, and inlier membership. To drive this unified representation, we introduce primitive proxies, learnable queries that are contextualized to produce assembly-ready outputs. To ensure consistent optimization, our training strategy couples primitives and points with online target updates. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks with four independent assembly solvers, UniCo consistently outperforms recent baselines, lowering Chamfer distance by up to 50% and improving normal consistency by up to 7%. These results establish an attractive recipe for structured 3D understanding from incomplete data. Project page: https://unico-completion.github.io.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we attempted to unleash the potential of self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task that can optimise the primary task of generalised deepfake detection. To explore this, we examined different combinations of the training schemes for these tasks that can be most effective. Our findings reveal that fusing the feature representation from self-supervised auxiliary tasks is a powerful feature representation for the problem at hand. Such a representation can leverage the ultimate potential and bring in a unique representation of both the self-supervised and primary tasks, achieving better performance for the primary task. We experimented on a large set of datasets, which includes DF40, FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFD, FaceShifter, UADFV, and our results showed better generalizability on cross-dataset evaluation when compared with current state-of-the-art detectors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00794v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Left ventricle (LV) segmentation is critical for clinical quantification and diagnosis of cardiac images. In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00796v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos requires simultaneously capturing high-frequency appearance details and temporally continuous motion. Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00005v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning offers potential solutions to current issues in industrial systems in areas such as quality control and predictive maintenance, but also faces unique barriers in industrial applications. An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00007v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Yahtzee is a classic dice game with a stochastic, combinatorial structure and delayed rewards, making it an interesting mid-scale RL benchmark. While an optimal policy for solitaire Yahtzee can be computed using dynamic programming methods, multiplayer is intractable, motivating approximation methods. We formulate Yahtzee as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and train self-play agents using various policy gradient methods: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all using a multi-headed network with a shared trunk. We ablate feature and action encodings, architecture, return estimators, and entropy regularization to understand their impact on learning. Under a fixed training budget, REINFORCE and PPO prove sensitive to hyperparameters and fail to reach near-optimal performance, whereas A2C trains robustly across a range of settings. Our agent attains a median score of 241.78 points over 100,000 evaluation games, within 5.0\% of the optimal DP score of 254.59, achieving the upper section bonus and Yahtzee at rates of 24.9\% and 34.1\%, respectively. All models struggle to learn the upper bonus strategy, overindexing on four-of-a-kind's, highlighting persistent long-horizon credit-assignment and exploration challenges.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00065v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single "breaker token" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.   To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.   Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00084v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for equation discovery, yet their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, a phenomenon we term instruction brittleness. Static prompts cannot adapt to the evolving state of a multi-step generation process, causing models to plateau at suboptimal solutions. To address this, we propose NeuroSymBO, which reframes prompt engineering as a sequential decision problem. Our method maintains a discrete library of reasoning strategies and uses Bayesian Optimization to select the optimal instruction at each step based on numerical feedback. Experiments on PDE discovery benchmarks show that adaptive instruction selection significantly outperforms fixed prompts, achieving higher recovery rates with more parsimonious solutions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present GRL-SNAM, a geometric reinforcement learning framework for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping(SNAM) in unknown environments. A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping. The code is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/CVC-Lab/GRL-SNAM}{Github}.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study reinforcement learning methods with linear function approximation under non-Markov state and cost processes. We first consider the policy evaluation method and show that the algorithm converges under suitable ergodicity conditions on the underlying non-Markov processes. Furthermore, we show that the limit corresponds to the fixed point of a joint operator composed of an orthogonal projection and the Bellman operator of an auxiliary \emph{Markov} decision process.   For Q-learning with linear function approximation, as in the Markov setting, convergence is not guaranteed in general. We show, however, that for the special case where the basis functions are chosen based on quantization maps, the convergence can be shown under similar ergodicity conditions. Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00152v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision making by formulating offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00172v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00175v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Objective: Develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting incident liver cirrhosis one, two, and three years prior to diagnosis using routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data, and to benchmark their performance against the FIB-4 score. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00186v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of preserving semantic meaning in communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mosquitos are the main transmissive agents of arboviral diseases. Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level. The shifted-window transformer design proposed here beat all baselines by a wide margin and set new best marks in spike-based neuronal infection classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, remain a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating continuous monitoring via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $\mu$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation. These outcomes provide an order-of-magnitude efficiency gain over compressed models, such as KD-Light (25 KB, 96.32% accuracy), advancing battery-less cardiac sensors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.

To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks validate the robustness and effectiveness of AGP method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is the default way to adapt LLMs, but widely used LoRA and QLoRA are largely geometry-agnostic: they optimize in fixed, randomly oriented low-rank subspaces with first-order descent, mostly ignoring local loss curvature. This can inflate the effective update budget and amplify drift along weakly constrained directions. We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law. Empirically, GRIT yields lower drift and a better updates-vs-retention frontier than strong PEFT-optimizer baselines (Orthogonal-LoRA, IA3, DoRA, Eff-FT, Shampoo).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00276v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a theory of feature learning in wide L2-regularized networks showing that supervised learning is inherently compressive. We derive a kernel ODE that predicts a "water-filling" spectral evolution and prove that for any stable steady state, the kernel rank is bounded by the number of classes ($C$). We further demonstrate that SGD noise is similarly low-rank ($O(C)$), confining dynamics to the task-relevant subspace. This framework unifies the deterministic and stochastic views of alignment and contrasts the low-rank nature of supervised learning with the high-rank, expansive representations of self-supervision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is extensively benchmarked on synthetic random instances such as MaxCut, TSP, and SAT problems, but these lack semantic structure and human interpretability, offering limited insight into performance on real-world problems with meaningful constraints. We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\% and random selection by 80.1\%. Our results demonstrate that structured benchmarks reveal advantages of problem-informed QAOA techniques obscured in random instances. We release all code, data, and experimental artifacts for reproducible NISQ algorithm research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a new detection method of faults at Nanosatellites' electrical power without an Attitude Determination Control Subsystem (ADCS) at the LEO orbit. Each part of this system is at risk of fault due to pressure tolerance, launcher pressure, and environmental circumstances. Common faults are line to line fault and open circuit for the photovoltaic subsystem, short circuit and open circuit IGBT at DC to DC converter, and regulator fault of the ground battery. The system is simulated without fault based on a neural network using solar radiation and solar panel's surface temperature as input data and current and load as outputs. Finally, using the neural network classifier, different faults are diagnosed by pattern and type of fault. For fault classification, other machine learning methods are also used, such as PCA classification, decision tree, and KNN.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human detection in videos plays an important role in various real-life applications. Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00417v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The efficacy of deep residual networks is fundamentally predicated on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $\beta(\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $\beta(\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00423v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning has enhanced the flow matching models on human preference alignment. While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step. Experimental results on different reward settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00428v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across a broad range of sectors, including high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.   To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is essential for the reliable operation of complex systems, but most existing methods require extensive task-specific training. We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our CCBMs, affirming their practical value in enabling dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00452v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00455v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider supervised learning with $n$ labels and show that layerwise SGD on residual networks can efficiently learn a class of hierarchical models. This model class assumes the existence of an (unknown) label hierarchy $L_1 \subseteq L_2 \subseteq \dots \subseteq L_r = [n]$, where labels in $L_1$ are simple functions of the input, while for $i > 1$, labels in $L_i$ are simple functions of simpler labels.   Our class surpasses models that were previously shown to be learnable by deep learning algorithms, in the sense that it reaches the depth limit of efficient learnability. That is, there are models in this class that require polynomial depth to express, whereas previous models can be computed by log-depth circuits.   Furthermore, we suggest that learnability of such hierarchical models might eventually form a basis for understanding deep learning. Beyond their natural fit for domains where deep learning excels, we argue that the mere existence of human ``teachers" supports the hypothesis that hierarchical structures are inherently available. By providing granular labels, teachers effectively reveal ``hints'' or ``snippets'' of the internal algorithms used by the brain. We formalize this intuition, showing that in a simplified model where a teacher is partially aware of their internal logic, a hierarchical structure emerges that facilitates efficient learnability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00457v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficiency through sparse activation, but the role of geometric regularization in expert specialization remains unclear. We apply orthogonality loss to enforce expert diversity and find it fails on multiple fronts: it does not reduce weight-space overlap (MSO actually increases by up to 114%), activation-space overlap remains high (~0.6) regardless of regularization, and effects on performance are inconsistent -- marginal improvement on WikiText-103 (-0.9%), slight degradation on TinyStories (+0.9%), and highly variable results on PTB (std > 1.0). Our analysis across 7 regularization strengths reveals no significant correlation (r = -0.293, p = 0.523) between weight and activation orthogonality. These findings demonstrate that weight-space regularization neither achieves its geometric goal nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE diversity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00459v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study multi-user contextual bandits where users are related by a graph and their reward functions exhibit both non-linear behavior and graph homophily. We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\{f_u\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear. Our work delivers a unified, theoretically grounded, and practical framework that bridges Laplacian regularization with kernelized bandits for structured exploration.

A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure. However, our results refer to one-dimensional dynamic problems, hence they don't rule out the possibility that PINNs and ML in general, may offer better strategies for high-dimensional problems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00513v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying small language models (7-9B parameters) as autonomous agents requires trust in their reasoning, not just their outputs. We reveal a critical reliability crisis: 50-69\% of correct answers from these models contain fundamentally flawed reasoning -- a ``Right-for-Wrong-Reasons'' phenomenon invisible to standard accuracy metrics. Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($\kappa=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks. Mechanistic analysis reveals RAG succeeds by grounding calculations in external evidence, reducing errors by 7.6\%, while meta-cognition amplifies confusion without sufficient model capacity. To enable deployment, verification capabilities are distilled into a neural classifier achieving 0.86 F1-score with 100$\times$ speedup. These results underscore the necessity of process-based verification for trustworthy agents: accuracy alone is dangerously insufficient when models can be right for entirely wrong reasons.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00516v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous LLM agents generate multi-step action plans that can fail due to contextual misalignment or structural incoherence. Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&amp;When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Characterising the heterogeneous presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires integrating biological and clinical markers within a unified predictive framework. While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles. SAFN provides a reproducible and transparent multimodal modelling paradigm for computational profiling of neurodegenerative disease.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00525v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks provide accurate predictions for sales data in the retail industry, but require a lot of computing power. It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate. These results show that larger models do not always achieve better results.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this article, we explore federated customization of large models and highlight the key challenges it poses within the federated learning framework. We review several popular large model customization techniques, including full fine-tuning, efficient fine-tuning, prompt engineering, prefix-tuning, knowledge distillation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Then, we discuss how these techniques can be implemented within the federated learning framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on federated prefix-tuning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first trial to apply prefix-tuning in the federated learning setting. The conducted experiments validate its feasibility with performance close to centralized approaches. Further comparison with three other federated customization methods demonstrated its competitive performance, satisfactory efficiency, and consistent robustness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00527v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planogram creation is a significant challenge for retail, requiring an average of 30 hours per complex layout. This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests. This work demonstrates the viability of generative AI for automated retail space optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00554v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Over the past decade, numerous theories have been proposed to explain the widespread vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial evasion attacks. Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00578v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To enhance the reproducibility and reliability of deep learning models, we address a critical gap in current training methodologies: the lack of mechanisms that ensure consistent and robust performance across runs. Our empirical analysis reveals that even under controlled initialization and training conditions, the accuracy of the model can exhibit significant variability. To address this issue, we propose a Custom Loss Function (CLF) that reduces the sensitivity of training outcomes to stochastic factors such as weight initialization and data shuffling. By fine-tuning its parameters, CLF explicitly balances predictive accuracy with training stability, leading to more consistent and reliable model performance. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures for both image classification and time series forecasting demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training robustness without sacrificing predictive performance. These results establish CLF as an effective and efficient strategy for developing more stable, reliable and trustworthy neural networks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00583v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) without compromising data privacy, the substantial size of an LLM renders on-device training impractical for resource-constrained clients, such as mobile devices. Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00604v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting cycling duration for a given route is essential for training planning and event preparation. Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts. Progressive checkpoint predictions enable dynamic race planning as route difficulty becomes apparent.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the context of smart city transportation, efficient matching of taxi supply with passenger demand requires real-time integration of urban traffic network data and mobility patterns. Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00611v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Maximizing submodular objectives under constraints is a fundamental problem in machine learning and optimization. We study the maximization of a nonnegative, non-monotone $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular function over a down-closed convex body. Our main result is an approximation algorithm whose guarantee depends smoothly on $\gamma$; in particular, when $\gamma=1$ (the DR-submodular case) our bound recovers the $0.401$ approximation factor, while for $\gamma<1$ the guarantee degrades gracefully and, it improves upon previously reported bounds for $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular maximization under the same constraints. Our approach combines a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a $\gamma$-aware double-greedy step, yielding a simple yet effective procedure for handling non-monotonicity. This results in state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone $\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular maximization over down-closed convex bodies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00624v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini increasingly act as general-purpose copilots, yet they often respond with unnecessary length on simple requests, adding redundant explanations, hedging, or boilerplate that increases cognitive load and inflates token-based inference cost. Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.   We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.   YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests. We release the benchmark and maintain a live leaderboard for tracking verbosity behavior over time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00655v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis proves convergence properties and robustness to mini-batch noise, while empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00664v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have attracted considerable research interest in reward modeling due to their interpretability, inference-time scalability, and potential for refinement through reinforcement learning (RL). However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00691v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ticket troubleshooting refers to the process of analyzing and resolving problems that are reported through a ticketing system. In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00698v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting using transformers is hampered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the rigidity of uniform patching, which may be misaligned with the data's semantic structure. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates. This makes it particularly well-suited for use cases with strong memory constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00728v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00737v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.

We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00748v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football is challenging, as traditional metrics do not capture the nuanced coordinated movements that limit opponent action selection and success probabilities. Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating "average" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00756v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient-based optimization with categorical variables typically relies on score-function estimators, which are unbiased but noisy, or on continuous relaxations that replace the discrete distribution with a smooth surrogate admitting a pathwise (reparameterized) gradient, at the cost of optimizing a biased, temperature-dependent objective. In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated data sharing promises utility without centralizing raw data, yet existing embedding-level generators struggle under non-IID client heterogeneity and provide limited formal protection against gradient leakage. We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions. After training, a neutral meta-code enables domain agnostic synthesis, while mixtures of meta-codes provide controllable multi-domain coverage. FedHypeVAE unifies personalization, privacy, and distribution alignment at the generator level, establishing a principled foundation for privacy-preserving data synthesis in federated settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns. By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\text{MW}} = 1.16 \times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically enhance their performance through either the retrieval of semantically similar information or the improvement of their reasoning capabilities. However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00004v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Depression is a major contributor to the mental-health burden in Nigeria, yet screening coverage remains limited due to low access to clinicians, stigma, and language barriers. Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities. This work provides a foundation for deploying conversational mental-health tools in linguistically diverse, resource-constrained environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a physical theory of intelligence grounded in irreversible information processing in systems constrained by conservation laws. An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient workload assignment to the workforce is critical in last-mile package delivery systems. In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00024v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The 13-card variant of Classic Indian Rummy is a sequential game of incomplete information that requires probabilistic reasoning and combinatorial decision-making. This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.

Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery improves realism yet limits creativity, while freedom from reference generates inventive but culturally ambiguous outcomes. The findings define a boundary between visual resemblance and architectural reasoning, positioning computational vernacular reasoning as a framework for analyzing how AI perceives, distorts, and reimagines traditional design intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00097v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Mortar, a system for autonomously evolving game mechanics for automatic game design. Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We perform ablation studies to assess the role of each system component and a user study to evaluate the games based on human feedback.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00121v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inventory management remains a challenge for many small and medium-sized businesses that lack the expertise to deploy advanced optimization methods. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant "hallucination tax": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.   To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned "digital twin" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational. Our results position LLMs not as replacements for operations research, but as natural-language interfaces that make rigorous, solver-based policies accessible to non-experts.

We propose Mathesis, a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes mathematical states as higher-order hypergraphs and uses a Symbolic Reasoning Kernel (SRK)--a differentiable logic engine that maps constraints to a continuous energy landscape. By defining a global energy function E(G), where zero energy implies logical consistency, the SRK yields gradient-based signals to train a Hypergraph Transformer Brain, turning proof search into energy minimization. Multi-step deduction is enabled via Monte Carlo Tree Search and Evolutionary Proof Search, guided by learned value functions and semantic unification.

Sweeping threshold epsilon produces smooth risk-coverage tradeoffs, reducing error rates f

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00142v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper compares three methodological categories of neural reasoning: LLM reasoning, supervised learning-based reasoning, and explicit model-based reasoning. LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning. We conclude that neural reasoning with explicit model construction is the most reliable among the three methodological categories of neural reasoning.

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design. FlashInfer-Bench thus establishes a practical, reproducible pathway for continuously improving AI-generated kernels and deploying them into large-scale LLM inference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal "us" versus "them" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00290v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical trial failure remains a central bottleneck in drug development, where minor protocol design flaws can irreversibly compromise outcomes despite promising therapeutics. Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials. Empirically, ClinicalReTrial improves 83.3% of trial protocols with a mean success probability gain of 5.7%, and retrospective case studies demonstrate strong alignment between the discovered redesign strategies and real-world clinical trial modifications.

In swarm research, the use of game theory methods holds the promise of explaining observed phenomena of collective utility adherence with rational self-interested swarm participants. In financial markets, a better understanding of how independent financial agents may self-organize for the betterment and stability of the marketplace would be a boon for market design researchers. This paper unifies Liquidity Games, where trader payoffs depend on aggregate liquidity within a trade, with Rational Swarms, where decentralized agents use difference rewards to align self-interested learning with global objectives. We offer a theoretical frameworks where we define a swarm of traders whose collective objective is market liquidity provision while maintaining agent independence. Using difference rewards within a Markov team games framework, we show that individual liquidity-maximizing behaviors contribute to overall market liquidity without requiring coordination or collusion. This Financial Swarm model provides a framework for modeling rational, independent agents where they achieve both individual profitability and collective market efficiency in bilateral asset markets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human biological systems sustain life through extraordinary resilience, continually detecting damage, orchestrating targeted responses, and restoring function through self-healing. Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage. Our results also demonstrated depth of analysis to over come uncertainties and amount of micro-agents invoked to achieve resilience.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization. In summary, ACCD provides a more accurate, efficient, and highly automated end-to-end solution for identifying coordinated behavior on social platforms, offering substantial practical value and promising potential for broad application.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00421v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems. The paper concludes by outlining future directions toward real-world data integration, predictive simulation, and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The generation of truly novel and diverse ideas is important for contemporary engineering design, yet it remains a significant cognitive challenge for novice designers. Current 'single-spurt' AI systems exacerbate this challenge by producing a high volume of semantically clustered ideas. We propose MIDAS (Meta-cognitive Ideation through Distributed Agentic AI System), a novel framework that replaces the single-AI paradigm with a distributed 'team' of specialized AI agents designed to emulate the human meta-cognitive ideation workflow. This agentic system progressively refines ideas and assesses each one for both global novelty (against existing solutions) and local novelty (against previously generated ideas). MIDAS, therefore, demonstrates a viable and progressive paradigm for true human-AI co-creation, elevating the human designer from a passive filterer to a participatory, active, collaborative partner.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00514v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Do reasoning models have "Aha!" moments? Prior work suggests that models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero undergo sudden mid-trace realizations that lead to accurate outputs, implying an intrinsic capacity for self-correction. Yet, it remains unclear whether such intrinsic shifts in reasoning strategy actually improve performance. Here, we study mid-reasoning shifts and instrument training runs to detect them. Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight. However, their effect varies with model uncertainty. Building on this finding, we show that artificially triggering extrinsic shifts under high entropy reliably improves accuracy. Our results show that mid-reasoning shifts are symptoms of unstable inference behavior rather than an intrinsic mechanism for self-correction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown strong potential for mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing paradigms for inferring pedestrian crossing behavior, ranging from statistical models to supervised learning methods, demonstrate limited generalizability and perform inadequately on new sites. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00743v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Integrating symbolic constraints into deep learning models could make them more robust, interpretable, and data-efficient. Still, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task. Existing frameworks like DomiKnowS help this integration by providing a high-level declarative programming interface, but they still assume the user is proficient with the library's specific syntax. We propose AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) to eliminate this dependency. ADS translates free-form task descriptions into a complete DomiKnowS program using an agentic workflow that creates and tests each DomiKnowS component separately. The workflow supports optional human-in-the-loop intervention, enabling users familiar with DomiKnowS to refine intermediate outputs. We show how ADS enables experienced DomiKnowS users and non-users to rapidly construct neuro-symbolic programs, reducing development time from hours to 10-15 minutes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments increasingly require planners that satisfy complex task sequences while adhering to strict temporal constraints. Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized B\"uchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools for planning, with compositional approaches offering particular promise for modeling long-horizon task distributions by composing together local, modular generative models. This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this \emph{mode averaging} problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing. More details: https://cdgsearch.github.io/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic fleets such as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have been widely used for routine inspections of static environments, where the areas of interest are known and planned in advance. However, in many applications, such areas of interest are unknown and should be identified online during exploration. Thus, this paper considers the problem of simultaneous exploration, inspection of unknown environments and then real-time communication to a mobile ground control station to report the findings. The heterogeneous robots are equipped with different sensors, e.g., long-range lidars for fast exploration and close-range cameras for detailed inspection. Furthermore, global communication is often unavailable in such environments, where the robots can only communicate with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks when they are in close proximity and free of obstruction. This work proposes a novel planning and coordination framework (SLEI3D) that integrates the online strategies for collaborative 3D exploration, adaptive inspection and timely communication (via the intermit-tent or proactive protocols). To account for uncertainties w.r.t. the number and location of features, a multi-layer and multi-rate planning mechanism is developed for inter-and-intra robot subgroups, to actively meet and coordinate their local plans. The proposed framework is validated extensively via high-fidelity simulations of numerous large-scale missions with up to 48 robots and 384 thousand cubic meters. Hardware experiments of 7 robots are also conducted. Project website is available at https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/SLEI3D/.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Perching allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to reduce energy consumption, remain anchored for surface sampling operations, or stably survey their surroundings. Previous efforts for perching on vertical surfaces have predominantly focused on lightweight mechanical design solutions with relatively scant system-level integration. Furthermore, perching strategies for vertical surfaces commonly require high-speed, aggressive landing operations that are dangerous for a surveyor drone with sensitive electronics onboard. This work presents the preliminary investigation of a perching approach suitable for larger drones that both gently perches on vertical tree trunks and reacts and recovers from perch failures. The system in this work, called SLAP, consists of vision-based perch site detector, an IMU (inertial-measurement-unit)-based perch failure detector, an attitude controller for soft perching, an optical close-range detection system, and a fast active elastic gripper with microspines made from commercially-available slapbands. We validated this approach on a modified 1.2 kg commercial quadrotor with component and system analysis. Initial human-in-the-loop autonomous indoor flight experiments achieved a 75% perch success rate on a real oak tree segment across 20 flights, and 100% perch failure recovery across 2 flights with induced failures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In vehicle production factories, the vehicle painting process employs multiple robotic arms to simultaneously apply paint to car bodies advancing along a conveyor line. Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and wheeled robots are widely used in many applications in both indoor and outdoor settings. In practical situations with limited GNSS signals or degraded lighting conditions, the navigation solution may rely only on inertial sensors and as result drift in time due to errors in the inertial measurement. In this work, we propose WiCHINS, a wheeled and chassis inertial navigation system by combining wheel-mounted-inertial sensors with a chassis-mounted inertial sensor for accurate pure inertial navigation. To that end, we derive a three-stage framework, each with a dedicated extended Kalman filter. This framework utilizes the benefits of each location (wheel/body) during the estimation process. To evaluate our proposed approach, we employed a dataset with five inertial measurement units with a total recording time of 228.6 minutes. We compare our approach with four other inertial baselines and demonstrate an average position error of 11.4m, which is $2.4\%$ of the average traveled distance, using two wheels and one body inertial measurement units. As a consequence, our proposed method enables robust navigation in challenging environments and helps bridge the pure-inertial performance gap.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00305v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The food packaging industry goes through changes in food items and their weights quite rapidly. These items range from easy-to-pick, single-piece food items to flexible, long and cluttered ones. We propose a replaceable bit-based gripper system to tackle the challenge of weight-based handling of cluttered food items. The gripper features specialized food attachments(bits) that enhance its grasping capabilities, and a belt replacement system allows switching between different food items during packaging operations. It offers a wide range of control options, enabling it to grasp and drop specific weights of granular, cluttered, and entangled foods. We specifically designed bits for two flexible food items that differ in shape: ikura(salmon roe) and spaghetti. They represent the challenging categories of sticky, granular food and long, sticky, cluttered food, respectively. The gripper successfully picked up both spaghetti and ikura and demonstrated weight-specific dropping of these items with an accuracy over 80% and 95% respectively. The gripper system also exhibited quick switching between different bits, leading to the handling of a large range of food items.

There are already many old, no longer functional spacecraft and debris orbiting the earth, which endanger both the safe operation of satellites and space travel. Small nano-satellite swarms can address this problem by autonomously de-orbiting debris safely into the Earth's atmosphere. This work builds on the recent advances of autonomous agents deployed in resource-constrained platforms and shows a first simplified approach how such intelligent and autonomous nano-satellite swarms can be realized. We implement our autonomous agent software on wireless microcontrollers and perform experiments on a specialized test-bed to show the feasibility and overall energy efficiency of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00545v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many hybrid problems in robotics involve both continuous and discrete components, and modeling them together for estimation tasks has been a long standing and difficult problem. Hybrid Factor Graphs give us a mathematical framework to model these types of problems, however existing approaches for solving them are based on approximations. In this work, we propose an efficient Hybrid Factor Graph framework alongwith a variable elimination algorithm to produce a hybrid Bayes network, which can then be used for exact Maximum A Posteriori estimation and marginalization over both sets of variables. Our approach first develops a novel hybrid Gaussian factor which can connect to both discrete and continuous variables, and a hybrid conditional which can represent multiple continuous hypotheses conditioned on the discrete variables. Using these representations, we derive the process of hybrid variable elimination under the Conditional Linear Gaussian scheme, giving us exact posteriors as hybrid Bayes network. To bound the number of discrete hypotheses, we use a tree-structured representation of the factors coupled with a simple pruning and probabilistic assignment scheme, which allows for tractable inference. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a SLAM dataset with ambiguous measurements, where discrete choices for the most likely measurement have to be made. Our demonstrated results showcase the accuracy, generality, and simplicity of our hybrid factor graph framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00555v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end LLM-based agentic exploration system for an indoor shopping task, evaluated in both Gazebo simulation and a corresponding real-world corridor layout. The robot incrementally builds a lightweight semantic map by detecting signboards at junctions and storing direction-to-POI relations together with estimated junction poses, while AprilTags provide repeatable anchors for approach and alignment. Given a natural-language shopping request, an LLM produces a constrained discrete action at each junction (direction and whether to enter a store), and a ROS finite-state main controller executes the decision by gating modular motion primitives, including local-costmap-based obstacle avoidance, AprilTag approaching, store entry, and grasping. Qualitative results show that the integrated stack can perform end-to-end task execution from user instruction to multi-store navigation and object retrieval, while remaining modular and debuggable through its text-based map and logged decision history.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00580v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-robot systems are widely used for coverage tasks that require efficient coordination across large environments. In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan. Sensitivity analyses further show that the method scales well with the number of robots and that zone coverage behavior can be effectively controlled by adjusting priority weights.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A large-scale mobile robot (LSMR) is a high-order multibody system that often operates on loose, unconsolidated terrain, which reduces traction. This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00610v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in many robotic applications, but it requires extensive exploration of the state-action space, during which behaviors can be unsafe. This significantly limits its applicability to large robots with complex actuators operating on unstable terrain. Hence, to design a safe goal-reaching control framework for large-scale robots, this paper decomposes the whole system into a set of tightly coupled functional modules. 1) A real-time visual pose estimation approach is employed to provide accurate robot states to 2) an RL motion planner for goal-reaching tasks that explicitly respects robot specifications. The RL module generates real-time smooth motion commands for the actuator system, independent of its underlying dynamic complexity. 3) In the actuation mechanism, a supervised deep learning model is trained to capture the complex dynamics of the robot and provide this model to 4) a model-based robust adaptive controller that guarantees the wheels track the RL motion commands even on slip-prone terrain. 5) Finally, to reduce human intervention, a mathematical safety supervisor monitors the robot, stops it on unsafe faults, and autonomously guides it back to a safe inspection area. The proposed framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation system and safety of the whole operation. Experiments on a 6,000 kg robot in different scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Multiple adjacent paths are generated that are (i) locally apart from each other by a distance equal to the working width of a machinery, while (ii) simultaneously floating at a projection distance equal to a specific working height above the terrain. The complexities of the algorithm in comparison to its 2D equivalent are highlighted. These include uniformly spaced elevation data generation using an Inverse Distance Weighting-approach and a local search. Area coverage path planning results for real-world 3D data within an agricultural context are presented to validate the algorithm.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A well-designed reward is critical for effective reinforcement learning-based policy improvement. In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a \emph{negative examples data augmentation} pipeline that generates calibrated \emph{negatives} and \emph{near-misses} via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B-parameter reward VLM in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a frontier physical reasoning VLM trained on robotics data, by a large margin, while substantially narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deformable scenes violate the rigidity assumptions underpinning classical visual-inertial odometry (VIO), often leading to over-fitting to local non-rigid motion or severe drift when deformation dominates visual parallax. We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of combining inertial constraints with observability-aware deformation activation, resulting in improved robustness under non-rigid environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: How do children respond to repeated robot errors? While prior research has examined adult reactions to successive robot errors, children's responses remain largely unexplored. In this study, we explore children's reactions to robot social errors and performance errors. For the latter, this study reproduces the successive robot failure paradigm of Liu et al. with child participants (N=59, ages 8-10) to examine how young users respond to repeated robot conversational errors. Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed. We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study. Like adults, children adjusted their prompts, modified their verbal tone, and exhibited increasingly emotional non-verbal responses throughout successive errors. However, children demonstrated more disengagement behaviors, including temporarily ignoring the robot or actively seeking an adult. Errors did not affect participants' perception of the robot, suggesting more flexible conversational expectations in children. These findings inform the design of more effective and developmentally appropriate human-robot interaction systems for young users.
