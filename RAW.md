- **标题**: SOSControl: Enhancing Human Motion Generation through Saliency-Aware Symbolic Orientation and Timing Control
- **作者**: Ho Yin Au, Junkun Jiang, Jie Chen

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14258
- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks often lack precise control, and existing approaches based on joint keyframe locations provide only positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify body part orientations and motion timing. To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14259v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

- **标题**: LURE: Latent Space Unblocking for Multi-Concept Reawakening in Diffusion Models

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14406
- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets. The dataset, model weights, and codes are released at https://github.com/Schuture/SegAE.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14438v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traffic scene understanding is essential for enabling autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive and interpret their environment, thereby ensuring safe navigation. This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14448v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.   We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters. Our code and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/nasa/Autonomous-Modular-Sensor-Wildfire-Segmentation/tree/main and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-u4vs9rqwkwgdeeeoUhftCxrfe_4QPTn?=usp=drive_link

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14477v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14490v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14563v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14593v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers. We propose 2D-VoCo, an efficient adaptation of the VoCo framework for slice-level self-supervised pre-training that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify multi-organ injuries. In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score over training from scratch. Our framework provides a practical method to reduce the dependency on labeled data and enhance model performance in clinical CT analysis. We release the code for reproducibility. https://github.com/tkz05/2D-VoCo-CT-Classifier

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14594v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14602v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space. Code and visualizations at https://oindrilasaha.github.io/3DScratchpad/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In clinical practice, medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes. Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14610v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

- **标题**: Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection
- **作者**: Yingsong Huang, Hui Guo, Jing Huang, Bing Bai, Qi Xiong

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14651v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14674v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.   We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object detection in video and image surveillance is a well-established yet rapidly evolving task, strongly influenced by recent deep learning advancements. This review summarises modern techniques by examining architectural innovations, generative model integration, and the use of temporal information to enhance robustness and accuracy. Unlike earlier surveys, it classifies methods based on core architectures, data processing strategies, and surveillance specific challenges such as dynamic environments, occlusions, lighting variations, and real-time requirements. The primary goal is to evaluate the current effectiveness of semantic object detection, while secondary aims include analysing deep learning models and their practical applications. The review covers CNN-based detectors, GAN-assisted approaches, and temporal fusion methods, highlighting how generative models support tasks such as reconstructing missing frames, reducing occlusions, and normalising illumination. It also outlines preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction progress, benchmarking datasets, and comparative evaluations. Finally, emerging trends in low-latency, efficient, and spatiotemporal learning approaches are identified for future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.   This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.   We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14690v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/IDIP-Lab/FeedbackSTS-Det.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14703v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14724v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/1anj/DeepMoLM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14741v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14742v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14776v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14777v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following. Code and demos are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/FunCineForge.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14788v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14791v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14797v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14799v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14802v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Patch-based methods are widely used in 3D medical image segmentation to address memory constraints in processing high-resolution volumetric data. However, these approaches often neglect the patch's location within the global volume, which can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important. In this paper, we investigate the role of location context in patch-based 3D segmentation and propose a novel attention mechanism, LocBAM, that explicitly processes spatial information. Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing. Furthermore, LocBAM consistently outperforms classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/compai-lab/2026-ISBI-hooft

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14804v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\chi$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14822v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Melanoma detection is vital for early diagnosis and effective treatment. While deep learning models on dermoscopic images have shown promise, they require specialized equipment, limiting their use in broader clinical settings. This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy. It employs a multi-modal neural network combining image and metadata processing and supports a two-step model for cases with or without metadata. A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371. Results demonstrate that integrating photo images with metadata in a structured, multi-stage pipeline yields significant performance improvements. This system advances melanoma detection by providing a scalable, equipment-independent solution suitable for diverse healthcare environments, bridging the gap between specialized and general clinical practices.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14895v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14959v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14978v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15017v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15049v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15065v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15115v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15123v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15133v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods. These findings provide an evidence-based view of how AI research is evolving and offer a resource for understanding broader trends and identifying emerging directions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15235v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15281v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15283v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15288v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14263v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&amp;A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&amp;A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&amp;A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&amp;A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While most LLMs are autoregressive, diffusion-based LLMs have recently emerged as an alternative method for generation. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks have proven effective against autoregressive models, but their applicability to diffusion language models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an exploratory study of GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion with mAsking), an open-source diffusion LLM. We evaluate multiple attack variants, including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, on harmful prompts drawn from the AdvBench dataset. Our study provides initial insights into the robustness and attack surface of diffusion language models and motivates the development of alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in this setting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14274v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/mattam301/DnR-WACV2026

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14275v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14283v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tree structures appear in many fields of the life sciences, including phylogenetics, developmental biology and nucleic acid structures. Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14300v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithms are widely adopted for personalized recommendations but often struggle in dynamic environments typical of fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and dramatic shifts in reward distributions due to external influences necessitate frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system. We subsequently deployed this system to production as the default catalog personalization system in May 2025 and observed a further 0.5% revenue improvement.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14336v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Log anomaly detection is essential for system reliability, but it is extremely challenging to do considering it involves class imbalance. Additionally, the models trained in one domain are not applicable to other domains, necessitating the need for cross-domain adaptation (such as HDFS and Linux). Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported. Our empirical findings validate that the proposed meta-learning-driven approach yielded the highest mean F1 score and proved to be effective for cross-domain settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug response in precision medicine requires models that capture how specific chemical substructures interact with cellular pathway states. However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14354v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Probabilistic computing using probabilistic bits (p-bits) presents an efficient alternative to traditional CMOS logic for complex problem-solving, including simulated annealing and machine learning. Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -- timing, intensity, and offset -- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14517v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $\kappa$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.

We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14549v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14556v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: MITRE ATT&amp;CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&amp;CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified "task space" characterization of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate forecasting of daily attendance is vital for managing transportation, crowd flows, and services at large-scale international events such as Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14590v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.   Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14603v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14633v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.   We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14687v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to automatically identify compact and interpretable mathematical expressions that model the functional relationship between input and output variables. Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14694v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14730v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14746v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data in edge environments, but is constrained by limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14758v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite their practical success, it remains unclear why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models can outperform dense networks beyond sheer parameter scaling. We study an iso-parameter regime where inputs exhibit latent modular structure but are corrupted by feature noise, a proxy for noisy internal activations. We show that sparse expert activation acts as a noise filter: compared to a dense estimator, MoEs achieve lower generalization error under feature noise, improved robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence speed. Empirical results on synthetic data and real-world language tasks corroborate the theoretical insights, demonstrating consistent robustness and efficiency gains from sparse modular computation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14798v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing good reflection questions is pedagogically important but time-consuming and unevenly supported across teachers. This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14917v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14942v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14954v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14968v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern machine learning systems are increasingly realised as multistage pipelines, yet existing transparency mechanisms typically operate at a model level: they describe what a system is and why it behaves as it does, but not how individual data samples are operationally recorded, tracked, and verified as they traverse the pipeline. This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15013v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Batch inference workloads for causal transformer models frequently process sequences that share common prefixes, such as system prompts, few-shot examples, or shared queries. Standard inference engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix. We introduce RadixMLP, a technique that exploits the position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings to eliminate this redundancy. RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. RadixMLP is stateless and operates within a single forward pass. In end-to-end serving benchmarks on MS~MARCO v1.1 with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59$\times$ speedups in realistic reranking workloads, with up to $5\times$ speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15015v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable conditional computation by routing inputs to multiple expert subnetworks and are often motivated as a mechanism for scaling large language models. In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15036v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Factorizable joint shift (FJS) was proposed as a type of distribution shift (or dataset shift) that comprises both covariate and label shift. Recently, it has been observed that FJS actually arises from consecutive label and covariate (or vice versa) shifts. Research into FJS so far has been confined to the case of categorical label spaces. We propose a framework for analysing distribution shift in the case of general label spaces, thus covering both classification and regression models. Based on the framework, we generalise existing results on FJS to general label spaces and propose a related extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm for class prior probabilities. We also take a fresh look at generalized label shift (GLS) in the case of general label spaces.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is a complex optimization problem in sustainable logistics, where routing decisions must minimize total travel distance, fleet size, and battery usage while satisfying strict customer time constraints. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15079v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15086v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15102v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15111v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15141v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL. Our models and code are available at GitHub

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14440v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14514v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14523v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14652v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14683v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\epsilon+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14691v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14702v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14711v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

Its rule-based formalism makes it inherently attractive for explainable and interpretive reasoning, which is gaining importance with the surge of Explainable AI (XAI). A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\'e and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Cir\'e and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14790v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14840v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces KRROOD, a framework designed to bridge the integration gap between modern software engineering and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR&amp;R) systems. While Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard for developing complex applications, existing KR&amp;R frameworks often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages that are difficult to integrate with imperative code. KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms. We evaluate the system on the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario. Experimental results show that KRROOD achieves strong performance while supporting the expressive reasoning required for real-world autonomous systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14894v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: Neuro-symbolic methods enhance the reliability of neural network classifiers through logical constraints, but they lack native support for ontologies.   Objectives: We aim to develop a neuro-symbolic method that reliably outputs predictions consistent with a Description Logic ontology that formalizes domain-specific knowledge.   Methods: We encode a Description Logic ontology as a circuit, a feed-forward differentiable computational graph that supports tractable execution of queries and transformations. We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.   Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.   Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields. We show that a single circuit representation can be used to tackle different challenging tasks closely related to real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: User interactions on e-commerce platforms are inherently diverse, involving behaviors such as clicking, favoriting, adding to cart, and purchasing. The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15029v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.   We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.   We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.   We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.   We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.

This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15160v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15197v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce RoboBrain 2.5, a next-generation embodied AI foundation model that advances general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal supervision. Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14437v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs) with autonomous reasoning, planning, and execution, into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms opens new operational possibilities and brings the vision of the Internet of Drones closer to reality. However, infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and the computational demands of multi-agent coordination limit real-world deployment in high-risk scenarios such as wildfires and disaster response. This paper investigates the integration of LLM-based agentic AI and edge computing to realize scalable and resilient autonomy in UAV swarms. We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Then, a use case for wildfire search and rescue (SAR) is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the edge-enabled architecture, enabling high SAR coverage, reduced mission completion times, and a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we highlight open challenges in integrating LLMs and edge computing for mission-critical UAV-swarm applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14445v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: The integration of haptic feedback into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) has long been limited by challenges in accurately rendering forces and ensuring system safety. The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic "kickback" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions. Our findings promote the advancement of haptic feedback systems for robotic surgery, offering a realistic and reliable interface for robot-assisted surgical procedures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14492v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic strawberry harvesting is challenging under partial occlusion, where leaves induce significant geometric uncertainty and make grasp decisions based on a single deterministic shape estimate unreliable. From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Task decomposition is critical for understanding and learning complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Especially for tasks involving rich physical interactions, relying solely on visual observations and robot proprioceptive information often fails to reveal the underlying event transitions. This raises the requirement for efficient collection of high-quality multi-modal data as well as robust segmentation method to decompose demonstrations into meaningful modules. Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying learning-based controllers across heterogeneous robots is challenging due to platform differences, inconsistent interfaces, and inefficient middleware. To address these issues, we present UniCon, a lightweight framework that standardizes states, control flow, and instrumentation across platforms. It decomposes workflows into execution graphs with reusable components, separating system states from control logic to enable plug-and-play deployment across various robot morphologies. Unlike traditional middleware, it prioritizes efficiency through batched, vectorized data flow, minimizing communication overhead and improving inference latency. This modular, data-oriented approach enables seamless sim-to-real transfer with minimal re-engineering. We demonstrate that UniCon reduces code redundancy when transferring workflows and achieves higher inference efficiency compared to ROS-based systems. Deployed on over 12 robot models from 7 manufacturers, it has been successfully integrated into ongoing research projects, proving its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14622v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language models are increasingly used for social robot navigation, yet existing benchmarks largely overlook principled prompt design for socially compliant behavior. This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14628v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in embodied intelligence have leveraged massive scaling of data and model parameters to master natural-language command following and multi-task control. In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe the emergence of biological motor characteristics without additional data or special guidance: it stops the shaking in robotic arms, saves significant energy(only 0.4w on Neuromorphic Processor), shows temporal memory ability and triggers safety reflexes in less than 20 milliseconds.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cadaveric studies have provided important insights into the mechanics of the human foot arch and plantar fascia. However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14649v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile Manipulation (MM) involves long-horizon decision-making over multi-stage compositions of heterogeneous skills, such as navigation and picking up objects. Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14681v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale $200m\times130m$ building environment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14809v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collaborative robots, or cobots, are increasingly integrated into various industrial and service settings to work efficiently and safely alongside humans. However, for effective human-robot collaboration, robots must reason based on human factors such as motivation level and aggression level. This paper proposes an approach for decision-making in human-robot collaborative (HRC) environments utilizing stochastic modeling. By leveraging probabilistic models and control strategies, the proposed method aims to anticipate human actions and emotions, enabling cobots to adapt their behavior accordingly. So far, most of the research has been done to detect the intentions of human co-workers. This paper discusses the theoretical framework, implementation strategies, simulation results, and potential applications of the bilateral collaboration approach for safety and efficiency in collaborative robotics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Soft robotic instruments could navigate delicate, tortuous anatomy more safely than rigid tools, but clinical adoption is limited by insufficient tip functionalization and real-time feedback at the tissue interface. Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy. Together, these results establish a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14871v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS), accurate tool localization is crucial to ensure patient safety and successful task execution. However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humanoid robots must adapt their contact behavior to diverse objects and tasks, yet most controllers rely on fixed, hand-tuned impedance gains and gripper settings. This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings. These results demonstrate the feasibility of linking semantic perception with retrieval-based control as an interpretable path toward adaptive humanoid manipulation.

Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions. Our results show that edge deployment preserves near-cloud accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 5\%. We further evaluate Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, a compact model optimized for resource-constrained environments, which achieves sub-second responsiveness, cutting latency by more than half but at the cost of accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14945v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11--based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.14998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: E-waste is growing rapidly while recycling rates remain low. We propose an electronic-device Graph-based Adaptive Planning (eGRAP) that integrates vision, dynamic planning, and dual-arm execution for autonomous disassembly. A camera-equipped arm identifies parts and estimates their poses, and a directed graph encodes which parts must be removed first. A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel. One arm carries a screwdriver (with an eye-in-hand depth camera) and the other holds or handles components. We demonstrate eGRAP on 3.5in hard drives: as parts are unscrewed and removed, the system updates its graph and plan online. Experiments show consistent full disassembly of each HDD, with high success rates and efficient cycle times, illustrating the method's ability to adaptively coordinate dual-arm tasks in real time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pure pursuit and its variants are widely used for mobile robot path tracking owing to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$\omega$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $\omega = \kappa v$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods. The proposed method has been integrated into the official Nav2 repository and is publicly available (https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15018v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Safety is a central requirement for automated vehicles. As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15025v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While deep learning has significantly advanced robotic object recognition, purely data-driven approaches often lack semantic consistency and fail to leverage valuable, pre-existing knowledge about the environment. This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dexterous grasping in cluttered environments presents substantial challenges due to the high degrees of freedom of dexterous hands, occlusion, and potential collisions arising from diverse object geometries and complex layouts. To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15056v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Falls are the leading cause of injury related hospitalization and mortality among older adults. Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With increasing levels of robot autonomy, robots are increasingly being supervised by users with varying levels of robotics expertise. As the diversity of the user population increases, it is important to understand how users with different expertise levels approach the supervision task and how this impacts performance of the human-robot team. This exploratory study investigates how operators with varying expertise levels perceive information and make intervention decisions when supervising a remote robot. We conducted a user study (N=27) where participants supervised a robot autonomously exploring four unknown tunnel environments in a simulator, and provided waypoints to intervene when they believed the robot had encountered difficulties. By analyzing the interaction data and questionnaire responses, we identify differing patterns in intervention timing and decision-making strategies across novice, intermediate, and expert users.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning long-horizon embodied behaviors from synthetic data remains challenging because generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs frequently "succeed" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable action sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., "get ready for work") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out "silent failures" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.15222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous drone racing represents a major frontier in robotics research. It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation.
