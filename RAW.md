- **标题**: HyperTopo-Adapters: Geometry- and Topology-Aware Segmentation of Leaf Lesions on Frozen Encoders
- **作者**: Chimdi Walter Ndubuisi, Toni Kazic

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Leaf-lesion segmentation is topology-sensitive: small merges, splits, or false holes can be biologically meaningful descriptors of biochemical pathways, yet they are weakly penalized by standard pixel-wise losses in Euclidean latents. I explore HyperTopo-Adapters, a lightweight, parameter-efficient head trained on top of a frozen vision encoder, which embeds features on a product manifold -- hyperbolic + Euclidean + spherical (H + E + S) -- to encourage hierarchical separation (H), local linear detail (E), and global closure (S). A topology prior complements Dice/BCE in two forms: (i) persistent-homology (PH) distance for evaluation and selection, and (ii) a differentiable surrogate that combines a soft Euler-characteristic match with total variation regularization for stable training. I introduce warm-ups for both the hyperbolic contrastive term and the topology prior, per-sample evaluation of structure-aware metrics (Boundary-F1, Betti errors, PD distance), and a min-PD within top-K Dice rule for checkpoint selection. On a Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940), early results show consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while Dice/IoU remain competitive. The study is diagnostic by design: I report controlled ablations (curvature learning, latent dimensions, contrastive temperature, surrogate settings), and ongoing tests varying encoder strength (ResNet-50, DeepLabV3, DINOv2/v3), input resolution, PH weight, and partial unfreezing of late blocks. The contribution is an open, reproducible train/eval suite (available at https://github.com/ChimdiWalter/HyperTopo-Adapters) that isolates geometric/topological priors and surfaces failure modes to guide stronger, topology-preserving architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06078v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) prediction plays a vital role in climate modeling and disaster forecasting. However, it remains challenging due to its nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and extended prediction horizons. To address this, we propose OptFormer, a novel encoder-decoder model that integrates phase-space reconstruction with a motion-aware attention mechanism guided by optical flow. Unlike conventional attention, our approach leverages inter-frame motion cues to highlight relative changes in the spatial field, allowing the model to focus on dynamic regions and capture long-range temporal dependencies more effectively. Experiments on NOAA SST datasets across multiple spatial scales demonstrate that OptFormer achieves superior performance under a 1:1 training-to-prediction setting, significantly outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and robustness.

- **标题**: Semantic Event Graphs for Long-Form Video Question Answering

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06097v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-form video question answering remains challenging for modern vision-language models, which struggle to reason over hour-scale footage without exceeding practical token and compute budgets. Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient. Code, logs, and event-extraction tools will be released for reproducibility.

- **标题**: COVR:Collaborative Optimization of VLMs and RL Agent for Visual-Based Control

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06122v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from poor sample efficiency due to high-dimensional observations in complex tasks. While existing works have shown that vision-language models (VLMs) can assist RL, they often focus on knowledge distillation from the VLM to RL, overlooking the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance the VLM. To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption. Extensive experiments show that COVR achieves strong performance across various challenging visual control tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06138v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To allow the development and assessment of physical rehabilitation by an intelligent tutoring system, we propose a medical dataset of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain rehabilitation exercises and benchmark on state of the art human movement analysis algorithms. This dataset is valuable because it includes rehabilitation motions in a clinical setting with patients in their rehabilitation program.

- **标题**: Forget-It-All: Multi-Concept Machine Unlearning via Concept-Aware Neuron Masking

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has raised concerns about their potential to generate copyrighted, inappropriate, or sensitive imagery learned from massive training corpora. As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06165v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current vision-language benchmarks predominantly feature well-structured questions with clear, explicit prompts. However, real user queries are often informal and underspecified. Users naturally leave much unsaid, relying on images to convey context. We introduce HAERAE-Vision, a benchmark of 653 real-world visual questions from Korean online communities (0.76% survival from 86K candidates), each paired with an explicit rewrite, yielding 1,306 query variants in total. Evaluating 39 VLMs, we find that even state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve under 50% on the original queries. Crucially, query explicitation alone yields 8 to 22 point improvements, with smaller models benefiting most. We further show that even with web search, under-specified queries underperform explicit queries without search, revealing that current retrieval cannot compensate for what users leave unsaid. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of VLM difficulty stem from natural query under-specification instead of model capability, highlighting a critical gap between benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06166v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accelerated dynamic volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4DMRI) is essential for applications relying on motion resolution. Existing 4DMRI produces acceptable artifacts of averaged breathing phases, which can blur and misrepresent instantaneous dynamic information. Recovery of such information requires a new paradigm to reconstruct extremely undersampled non-Cartesian k-space data. We propose B-FIRE, a binning-free diffusion implicit neural representation framework for hyper-accelerated MR reconstruction capable of reflecting instantaneous 3D abdominal anatomy. B-FIRE employs a CNN-INR encoder-decoder backbone optimized using diffusion with a comprehensive loss that enforces image-domain fidelity and frequency-aware constraints. Motion binned image pairs were used as training references, while inference was performed on binning-free undersampled data. Experiments were conducted on a T1-weighted StarVIBE liver MRI cohort, with accelerations ranging from 8 spokes per frame (RV8) to RV1. B-FIRE was compared against direct NuFFT, GRASP-CS, and an unrolled CNN method. Reconstruction fidelity, motion trajectory consistency, and inference latency were evaluated.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06168v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Handwritten digit images lie in a high-dimensional pixel space but exhibit strong geometric and statistical structure. This paper investigates the latent organization of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three complementary dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry. UMAP uncovers nonlinear manifolds that reflect smooth stylistic transitions between digit classes. Together, these results demonstrate that handwritten digits occupy a structured low-dimensional manifold and that different statistical frameworks expose complementary aspects of this structure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06169v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-Image In-Context Learning (T2I-ICL) enables customized image synthesis via interleaved text-image examples but faces two mutually reinforcing bottlenecks, compliance failure and prior-dominated hallucination, that form a vicious cycle degrading generation quality. Existing methods rely on tailored training, which limits flexibility and raises deployment costs. To address these challenges effectively, we propose TBDN, a training-free framework integrating two complementary closed-loop mechanisms: Hint Instruction (HI) and Query Contrastive Decoding (QCD). HI injects task-aware inductive bias via lightweight prompt engineering to anchor models on contextual mapping rules, thereby mitigating compliance failure. QCD adjusts the decoding distributions of language models by contrasting full-input and query-omitted distributions, suppressing prior-dominated hallucination. TBDN achieves State-of-the-Art performance on CoBSAT and Text-to-Image Fast Mini-ImageNet, with robust generalization across model backbones, prompt designs, and hyperparameters. It also maintains promising performance in concept preservation and prompt following on Dreambench++. By breaking the two bottlenecks, TBDN establishes a simple yet effective framework for efficient and reliable T2I-ICL.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Large Video-Language Models (Video-LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in perception, their reasoning capabilities remain a bottleneck. Existing solutions typically resort to a heavy "data engineering" paradigm-synthesizing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This pipeline primarily optimizes probability sampling efficiency and aligns output distributions, but fails to activate the intrinsic intelligence required for dynamic visual exploration. In this work, we propose TIR-Flow, a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from passive processing to active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updating. Concretely, our framework operates through three synergistic modules: HDD decomposes complex queries into a set of verifiable sub-tasks; HAP actively directs visual attention to gather high-resolution evidence for hypothesis validation; EBA maintains a persistent workspace to accumulate and update the discovered clues for logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines, delivering an average performance boost of 5.9%, with gains reaching 10.5% on Egoschema. Our analysis confirms that empowering frozen VLMs with System-2-like active perception is a scalable path toward solving long-horizon video reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06187v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study presents a unified Attention U-Net architecture trained jointly on MRI (BraTS 2021) and CT (LIDC-IDRI) datasets to investigate the generalizability of a single model across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical sites. Our proposed pipeline incorporates modality-harmonized preprocessing, attention-gated skip connections, and a modality-aware Focal Tversky loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to evaluate a single Attention U-Net trained simultaneously on separate MRI (BraTS) and CT (LIDC-IDRI) tumor datasets, without relying on modality-specific encoders or domain adaptation. The unified model demonstrates competitive performance in terms of Dice coefficient, IoU, and AUC on both domains, thereby establishing a robust and reproducible baseline for future research in cross-modality tumor segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Biryani, one of India's most celebrated dishes, exhibits remarkable regional diversity in its preparation, ingredients, and presentation. With the growing availability of online cooking videos, there is unprecedented potential to study such culinary variations using computational tools systematically. However, existing video understanding methods fail to capture the fine-grained, multimodal, and culturally grounded differences in procedural cooking videos. This work presents the first large-scale, curated dataset of biryani preparation videos, comprising 120 high-quality YouTube recordings across 12 distinct regional styles. We propose a multi-stage framework leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units and align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text. Building on these aligned representations, we introduce a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. We construct a comprehensive question-answer (QA) benchmark spanning multiple reasoning levels to evaluate procedural understanding in VLMs. Our approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles, incorporates human-in-the-loop verification for high-precision tasks, and benchmarks several state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The resulting dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos. We release all data, code, and the project website at https://farzanashaju.github.io/how-does-india-cook-biryani/.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Content-Preserving Style transfer, given content and style references, remains challenging for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) due to its internal entangled content and style features. In this technical report, we propose the first content-preserving style transfer model trained on Qwen-Image-Edit, which activates Qwen-Image-Edit's strong content preservation and style customization capability. We collected and filtered high quality data of limited specific styles and synthesized triplets with thousands categories of style images in-the-wild. We introduce the Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train QwenStyle with such mixture of clean and noisy triplets, which enables QwenStyle to generalize to unseen styles without degradation of the precise content preservation capability. Our QwenStyle V1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in three core metrics: style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality.

- **标题**: Cascading multi-agent anomaly detection in surveillance systems via vision-language models and embedding-based classification
- **作者**: Tayyab Rehman, Giovanni De Gasperis, Aly Shmahell

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06204
- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intelligent anomaly detection in dynamic visual environments requires reconciling real-time performance with semantic interpretability. Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.

- **标题**: When Imbalance Comes Twice: Active Learning under Simulated Class Imbalance and Label Shift in Binary Semantic Segmentation

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06209
- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06209v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The aim of Active Learning is to select the most informative samples from an unlabelled set of data. This is useful in cases where the amount of data is large and labelling is expensive, such as in machine vision or medical imaging. Two particularities of machine vision are first, that most of the images produced are free of defects, and second, that the amount of images produced is so big that we cannot store all acquired images. This results, on the one hand, in a strong class imbalance in defect distribution and, on the other hand, in a potential label shift caused by limited storage. To understand how these two forms of imbalance affect active learning algorithms, we propose a simulation study based on two open-source datasets. We artificially create datasets for which we control the levels of class imbalance and label shift. Three standard active learning selection strategies are compared: random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection. We demonstrate that active learning strategies, and in particular the entropy-based and core-set selections, remain interesting and efficient even for highly imbalanced datasets. We also illustrate and measure the loss of efficiency that occurs in the situation a strong label shift.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Akasha 2, a state-of-the-art multimodal architecture that integrates Hamiltonian State Space Duality (H-SSD) with Visual-Language Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (VL-JEPA). The system leverages the Mamba-3 Selective State Space Model (SSM) augmented by a Sparse Mixture of Hamiltonian Experts (SMoE-HE) that enforces latent physical conservation laws through symplectic integration. For visual synthesis, we introduce Hamiltonian Flow Matching (HFM) and persistent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling ultra-low latency (<50ms) on mobile hardware. This work establishes a new paradigm in latent world models, achieving unprecedented spatiotemporal coherence through a holographic memory architecture. Our approach demonstrates that incorporating physics-inspired inductive biases into neural architectures yields significant improvements: state-of-the-art video prediction (FVD: 287), 4x faster visual synthesis than diffusion models, and 3-18x inference speedup over transformer baselines while maintaining energy conservation over extended horizons.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a cost-effective two-step authentication system that integrates face identification and speaker verification using only a camera and microphone available on common devices. The pipeline first performs face recognition to identify a candidate user from a small enrolled group, then performs voice recognition only against the matched identity to reduce computation and improve robustness. For face recognition, a pruned VGG-16 based classifier is trained on an augmented dataset of 924 images from five subjects, with faces localized by MTCNN; it achieves 95.1% accuracy. For voice recognition, a CNN speaker-verification model trained on LibriSpeech (train-other-360) attains 98.9% accuracy and 3.456% EER on test-clean.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Malicious image manipulation threatens public safety and requires efficient localization methods. Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, their practical deployment is severely hindered by hallucination issues, which become particularly acute during Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization. This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces hallucination rates and effectively enhances the inference accuracy of MLLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The scarcity and low diversity of well-annotated automotive radar datasets often limit the performance of deep-learning-based environmental perception. To overcome these challenges, we propose a conditional generative framework for synthesizing realistic Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps. Our approach leverages a generative diffusion model to generate radar data for multiple object categories, including pedestrians, cars, and cyclists. Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation. These results indicate that our generative framework not only produces physically plausible and diverse radar spectrum but also substantially improves model generalization in downstream tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06239v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As multimedia content is quickly growing, the field of facial recognition has become one of the major research fields, particularly in the recent years. The most problematic area to researchers in image processing and computer vision is the human face which is a complex object with myriads of distinctive features that can be used to identify the face. The survey of this survey is particularly focused on most challenging facial characteristics, including differences in the light, ageing, variation in poses, partial occlusion, and facial expression and presents methodological solutions. The factors, therefore, are inevitable in the creation of effective facial recognition mechanisms used on facial images. This paper reviews the most sophisticated methods of facial detection which are Hidden Markov Models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Elastic Cluster Plot Matching, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gabor Waves, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Eigenfaces, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and 3D Morphable Model. Alongside the works mentioned above, we have also analyzed the images of a number of facial databases, namely JAFEE, FEI, Yale, LFW, AT&amp;T (then called ORL), and AR (created by Martinez and Benavente), to analyze the results. However, this survey is aimed at giving a thorough literature review of face recognition, and its applications, and some experimental results are provided at the end after a detailed discussion.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce EyeTheia, a lightweight and open deep learning pipeline for webcam-based gaze estimation, designed for browser-based experimental platforms and real-world cognitive and clinical research. EyeTheia enables real-time gaze tracking using only a standard laptop webcam, combining MediaPipe-based landmark extraction with a convolutional neural network inspired by iTracker and optional user-specific fine-tuning. We investigate two complementary strategies: adapting a model pretrained on mobile data and training the same architecture from scratch on a desktop-oriented dataset. Validation results on MPIIFaceGaze show comparable performance between both approaches prior to calibration, while lightweight user-specific fine-tuning consistently reduces gaze prediction error. We further evaluate EyeTheia in a realistic Dot-Probe task and compare it to the commercial webcam-based tracker SeeSo SDK. Results indicate strong agreement in left-right gaze allocation during stimulus presentation, despite higher temporal variability. Overall, EyeTheia provides a transparent and extensible solution for low-cost gaze tracking, suitable for scalable and reproducible experimental and clinical studies. The code, trained models, and experimental materials are publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Underwater sonar imaging plays a crucial role in various applications, including autonomous navigation in murky water, marine archaeology, and environmental monitoring. However, the unique characteristics of sonar images, such as complex noise patterns and the lack of elevation information, pose significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. In this paper, we present NAS-GS, a novel Noise-Aware Sonar Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed to address these challenges. Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real-world large-scale offshore sonar scenarios, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Third Perception Test challenge was organised as a full-day workshop alongside the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training video-language models is often prohibitively expensive due to the high cost of processing long frame sequences and the limited availability of annotated long videos. We present VideoWeave, a simple yet effective approach to improve data efficiency by constructing synthetic long-context training samples that splice together short, captioned videos from existing datasets. Rather than modifying model architectures or optimization objectives, VideoWeave reorganizes available video-text pairs to expand temporal diversity within fixed compute. We systematically study how different data composition strategies like random versus visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment affect downstream performance on downstream video question answering. Under identical compute constraints, models trained with VideoWeave achieve higher accuracy than conventional video finetuning. Our results highlight that reorganizing training data, rather than altering architectures, may offer a simple and scalable path for training video-language models. We link our code for all experiments here.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06391v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Object-WIPER, a training-free framework for removing dynamic objects and their associated visual effects from videos, and inpainting them with semantically consistent and temporally coherent content. Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining. Our new benchmark, source code, and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06394v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding student behavior in the classroom is essential to improve both pedagogical quality and student engagement. Existing methods for predicting student engagement typically require substantial annotated data to model the diversity of student behaviors, yet privacy concerns often restrict researchers to their own proprietary datasets. Moreover, the classroom context, represented in peers' actions, is ignored. To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions. Finally, we leverage the large language model to classify this entire sequence of actions, together with the classroom context, as belonging to an engaged or disengaged student. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying student engagement.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06413v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video outpainting extends a video beyond its original boundaries by synthesizing missing border content. Compared with image outpainting, it requires not only per-frame spatial plausibility but also long-range temporal coherence, especially when outpainted content becomes visible across time under camera or object motion. We propose GlobalPaint, a diffusion-based framework for spatiotemporal coherent video outpainting. Our approach adopts a hierarchical pipeline that first outpaints key frames and then completes intermediate frames via an interpolation model conditioned on the completed boundaries, reducing error accumulation in sequential processing. At the model level, we augment a pretrained image inpainting backbone with (i) an Enhanced Spatial-Temporal module featuring 3D windowed attention for stronger spatiotemporal interaction, and (ii) global feature guidance that distills OpenCLIP features from observed regions across all frames into compact global tokens using a dedicated extractor. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate improved reconstruction quality and more natural motion compared to prior methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06442v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Point Cloud-based Place Recognition (PCPR) demonstrates considerable potential in applications such as autonomous driving, robot localization and navigation, and map update. In practical applications, point clouds used for place recognition are often acquired from different platforms and LiDARs across varying scene. However, existing PCPR datasets lack diversity in scenes, platforms, and sensors, which limits the effective development of related research. To address this gap, we establish WHU-PCPR, a cross-platform heterogeneous point cloud dataset designed for place recognition. The dataset differentiates itself from existing datasets through its distinctive characteristics: 1) cross-platform heterogeneous point clouds: collected from survey-grade vehicle-mounted Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems and low-cost Portable helmet-mounted Laser Scanning (PLS) systems, each equipped with distinct mechanical and solid-state LiDAR sensors. 2) Complex localization scenes: encompassing real-time and long-term changes in both urban and campus road scenes. 3) Large-scale spatial coverage: featuring 82.3 km of trajectory over a 60-month period and an unrepeated route of approximately 30 km. Based on WHU-PCPR, we conduct extensive evaluation and in-depth analysis of several representative PCPR methods, and provide a concise discussion of key challenges and future research directions. The dataset and benchmark code are available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/WHU-PCPR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A substantial body of health research demonstrates a strong link between neighborhood environments and health outcomes. Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging advances in computer vision to enable large-scale, systematic characterization of neighborhood built environments. However, the generalizability of vision models across fundamentally different domains remains uncertain, for example, transferring knowledge from ImageNet to the distinct visual characteristics of Google Street View (GSV) imagery. In applied fields such as social health research, several critical questions arise: which models are most appropriate, whether to adopt unsupervised training strategies, what training scale is feasible under computational constraints, and how much such strategies benefit downstream performance. These decisions are often costly and require specialized expertise.   In this paper, we answer these questions through empirical analysis and provide practical insights into how to select and adapt foundation models for datasets with limited size and labels, while leveraging larger, unlabeled datasets through unsupervised training. Our study includes comprehensive quantitative and visual analyses comparing model performance before and after unsupervised adaptation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06460v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications that require reliable visual grounding. However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06464v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as PointLLM and GPT4Point, have shown strong reasoning and generalization abilities in 3D understanding tasks. However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of improving the adversarial robustness of 3D VLMs, especially as they are deployed in safety-critical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In autonomous driving, Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning , whereas semantic occupancy provides fine-grained details. Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Radio astronomy is an indispensable discipline for observing distant celestial objects. Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06479v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Facial optical flow supports a wide range of tasks in facial motion analysis. However, the lack of high-resolution facial optical flow datasets has hindered progress in this area. In this paper, we introduce Splatting Rasterization Flow (SRFlow), a high-resolution facial optical flow dataset, and Splatting Rasterization Guided FlowNet (SRFlowNet), a facial optical flow model with tailored regularization losses. These losses constrain flow predictions using masks and gradients computed via difference or Sobel operator. This effectively suppresses high-frequency noise and large-scale errors in texture-less or repetitive-pattern regions, enabling SRFlowNet to be the first model explicitly capable of capturing high-resolution skin motion guided by Gaussian splatting rasterization. Experiments show that training with the SRFlow dataset improves facial optical flow estimation across various optical flow models, reducing end-point error (EPE) by up to 42% (from 0.5081 to 0.2953). Furthermore, when coupled with the SRFlow dataset, SRFlowNet achieves up to a 48% improvement in F1-score (from 0.4733 to 0.6947) on a composite of three micro-expression datasets. These results demonstrate the value of advancing both facial optical flow estimation and micro-expression recognition.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06484v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a zero-shot framework for transferring human facial expressions to 3D animal face meshes. Our method combines intrinsic geometric descriptors (HKS/WKS) with a mesh-agnostic latent embedding that disentangles facial identity and expression. The ID latent space captures species-independent facial structure, while the expression latent space encodes deformation patterns that generalize across humans and animals. Trained only with human expression pairs, the model learns the embeddings, decoupling, and recoupling of cross-identity expressions, enabling expression transfer without requiring animal expression data. To enforce geometric consistency, we employ Jacobian loss together with vertex-position and Laplacian losses. Experiments show that our approach achieves plausible cross-species expression transfer, effectively narrowing the geometric gap between human and animal facial shapes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06496v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, reason about, and describe objects and their relationships within three-dimensional environments, forming a foundation for embodied perception and scene understanding. 3D captioning aims to describe 3D scenes in natural language; however, it remains challenging due to the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds and, more critically, the weak grounding and limited out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of existing captioners across drastically different environments, including indoor and outdoor 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we propose 3D CoCa v2, a generalizable 3D captioning framework that unifies contrastive vision-language learning with 3D caption generation and further improves robustness via test-time search (TTS) without updating the captioner parameters. 3D CoCa v2 builds on a frozen CLIP-based semantic prior, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder for geometry, and a multimodal decoder jointly optimized with contrastive and captioning objectives, avoiding external detectors or handcrafted proposals. At inference, TTS produces diverse caption candidates and performs reward-guided selection using a compact scene summary. Experiments show improvements over 3D CoCa of +1.50 CIDEr@0.5IoU on ScanRefer and +1.61 CIDEr@0.5IoU on Nr3D, and +3.8 CIDEr@0.25 in zero-shot OOD evaluation on TOD3Cap.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) have focused heavily on Diffusion Probabilistic Models, which achieve high perceptual quality but suffer from significant computational latency (often exceeding 2-4 seconds per image). Conversely, traditional CNN-based baselines offer real-time inference but struggle with "over-smoothing," failing to recover fine structural details in extreme low-light conditions. This creates a practical gap in the literature: the lack of a model that provides generative-level texture recovery at edge-deployable speeds. In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s. This represents a 40x speedup over latent diffusion models, making our approach suitable for near real-time applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06521v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While humans develop core visual skills long before acquiring language, contemporary Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still rely heavily on linguistic priors to compensate for their fragile visual understanding. We uncovered a crucial fact: state-of-the-art MLLMs consistently fail on basic visual tasks that humans, even 3-year-olds, can solve effortlessly. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce BabyVision, a benchmark designed to assess core visual abilities independent of linguistic knowledge for MLLMs. BabyVision spans a wide range of tasks, with 388 items divided into 22 subclasses across four key categories. Empirical results and human evaluation reveal that leading MLLMs perform significantly below human baselines. Gemini3-Pro-Preview scores 49.7, lagging behind 6-year-old humans and falling well behind the average adult score of 94.1. These results show despite excelling in knowledge-heavy evaluations, current MLLMs still lack fundamental visual primitives. Progress in BabyVision represents a step toward human-level visual perception and reasoning capabilities. We also explore solving visual reasoning with generation models by proposing BabyVision-Gen and automatic evaluation toolkit. Our code and benchmark data are released at https://github.com/UniPat-AI/BabyVision for reproduction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06525v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image deblurring has advanced rapidly with deep learning, yet most methods exhibit poor generalization beyond their training datasets, with performance dropping significantly in real-world scenarios. Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data. We further introduce Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation, and integrate it into GLOWDeblur, a Generalizable reaL-wOrld lightWeight Deblur model that combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment module with a lightweight diffusion backbone. Extensive experiments on six widely-used benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate our approach, confirming the importance of blur priors for robust generalization and demonstrating that the lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practicality in real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present V-HPOT, a novel approach for improving the cross-domain performance of 3D hand pose estimation from egocentric images across diverse, unseen domains. State-of-the-art methods demonstrate strong performance when trained and tested within the same domain. However, they struggle to generalise to new environments due to limited training data and depth perception -- overfitting to specific camera intrinsics. Our method addresses this by estimating keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space, normalised by focal length and image size, enabling camera-agnostic depth prediction. We further leverage this invariance to camera intrinsics to propose a self-supervised test-time optimisation strategy that refines the model's depth perception during inference. This is achieved by applying a 3D consistency loss between predicted and in-space scale-transformed hand poses, allowing the model to adapt to target domain characteristics without requiring ground truth annotations. V-HPOT significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios, achieving a 71% reduction in mean pose error on the H2O dataset and a 41% reduction on the AssemblyHands dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, V-HPOT outperforms all single-stage approaches across all datasets and competes closely with two-stage methods, despite needing approximately x3.5 to x14 less data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) systems have achieved remarkable precision in localization and association, effectively answering \textit{where} and \textit{who}. However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \textit{what} and \textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Grounding events in videos serves as a fundamental capability in video analysis. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly employed for this task, existing approaches predominantly train models to associate events with timestamps in the forward video only. This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs. Specifically, we categorize events into time-sensitive (e.g., putting down a bag) and time-insensitive (e.g., holding a towel in the left hand). The former denote events whose reversal substantially alters their meaning, while the latter remain semantically unchanged under reversal. For time-sensitive events, ArrowGEV introduces a reward that encourages VLMs to discriminate between forward and backward videos, whereas for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArrowGEV not only improves grounding precision and temporal directionality recognition, but also enhances general video understanding and reasoning ability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06566v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces QCaption, a novel video captioning and Q&amp;A pipeline that enhances video analytics by fusing three models: key frame extraction, a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for image-text analysis, and a Large Language Model (LLM) for text analysis. This approach enables integrated analysis of text, images, and video, achieving performance improvements over existing video captioning and Q&amp;A models; all while remaining fully self-contained, adept for on-premises deployment. Experimental results using QCaption demonstrated up to 44.2% and 48.9% improvements in video captioning and Q&amp;A tasks, respectively. Ablation studies were also performed to assess the role of LLM on the fusion on the results. Moreover, the paper proposes and evaluates additional video captioning approaches, benchmarking them against QCaption and existing methodologies. QCaption demonstrate the potential of adopting a model fusion approach in advancing video analytics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-objective alignment for text-to-image generation is commonly implemented via static linear scalarization, but fixed weights often fail under heterogeneous rewards, leading to optimization imbalance where models overfit high-variance, high-responsiveness objectives (e.g., OCR) while under-optimizing perceptual goals. We identify two mechanistic causes: variance hijacking, where reward dispersion induces implicit reweighting that dominates the normalized training signal, and gradient conflicts, where competing objectives produce opposing update directions and trigger seesaw-like oscillations. We propose APEX (Adaptive Priority-based Efficient X-objective Alignment), which stabilizes heterogeneous rewards with Dual-Stage Adaptive Normalization and dynamically schedules objectives via P^3 Adaptive Priorities that combine learning potential, conflict penalty, and progress need. On Stable Diffusion 3.5, APEX achieves improved Pareto trade-offs across four heterogeneous objectives, with balanced gains of +1.31 PickScore, +0.35 DeQA, and +0.53 Aesthetics while maintaining competitive OCR accuracy, mitigating the instability of multi-objective alignment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-guided image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale diffusion models, yet achieving precise stylization with visual exemplars remains difficult. Existing approaches often depend on task-specific retraining or expensive inversion procedures, which can compromise content integrity, reduce style fidelity, and lead to an unsatisfactory trade-off between semantic prompt adherence and style alignment. In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided synthesis as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion. We further analyze the imbalance and noise sensitivity inherent in multimodal attention fusion and propose a Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism that reweights attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens, effectively resolving guidance conflicts and enhancing output coherence. Experiments show that our approach achieves high-fidelity stylization with superior semantic-style balance and visual quality, offering a simple yet powerful alternative to complex, artifact-prone prior methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06642v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Organoids, sophisticated in vitro models of human tissues, are crucial for medical research due to their ability to simulate organ functions and assess drug responses accurately. Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training. By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, our work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking new potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06647v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tracking skiers in RGB broadcast footage is challenging due to motion blur, static overlays, and clutter that obscure the fast-moving athlete. Event cameras, with their asynchronous contrast sensing, offer natural robustness to such artifacts, yet a controlled benchmark for winter-sport tracking has been missing. We introduce event SkiTB (eSkiTB), a synthetic event-based ski tracking dataset generated from SkiTB using direct video-to-event conversion without neural interpolation, enabling an iso-informational comparison between RGB and event modalities. Benchmarking SDTrack (spiking transformer) against STARK (RGB transformer), we find that event-based tracking is substantially resilient to broadcast clutter in scenes dominated by static overlays, achieving 0.685 IoU, outperforming RGB by +20.0 points. Across the dataset, SDTrack attains a mean IoU of 0.711, demonstrating that temporal contrast is a reliable cue for tracking ballistic motion in visually congested environments. eSkiTB establishes the first controlled setting for event-based tracking in winter sports and highlights the promise of event cameras for ski tracking. The dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/eventbasedvision/eSkiTB.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06673v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate characterization of carbon nanotube morphologies in electron microscopy images is vital for exposure assessment and toxicological studies, yet current workflows rely on slow, subjective manual segmentation. This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Iris recognition is a mature biometric technology offering remarkable precision and speed, and allowing for large-scale deployments to populations exceeding a billion enrolled users (e.g., AADHAAR in India). However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.   This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.   We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06750v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) require egocentric clinical intent understanding for real-world deployment, yet existing benchmarks fail to evaluate this critical capability. To address these challenges, we introduce MedGaze-Bench, the first benchmark leveraging clinician gaze as a Cognitive Cursor to assess intent understanding across surgery, emergency simulation, and diagnostic interpretation. Our benchmark addresses three fundamental challenges: visual homogeneity of anatomical structures, strict temporal-causal dependencies in clinical workflows, and implicit adherence to safety protocols. We propose a Three-Dimensional Clinical Intent Framework evaluating: (1) Spatial Intent: discriminating precise targets amid visual noise, (2) Temporal Intent: inferring causal rationale through retrospective and prospective reasoning, and (3) Standard Intent: verifying protocol compliance through safety checks. Beyond accuracy metrics, we introduce Trap QA mechanisms to stress-test clinical reliability by penalizing hallucinations and cognitive sycophancy. Experiments reveal current MLLMs struggle with egocentric intent due to over-reliance on global features, leading to fabricated observations and uncritical acceptance of invalid instructions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06777v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Normalized difference indices have been a staple in remote sensing for decades. They stay reliable under lighting changes produce bounded values and connect well to biophysical signals. Even so, they are usually treated as a fixed pre processing step with coefficients set to one, which limits how well they can adapt to a specific learning task. In this study, we introduce the Normalized Difference Layer that is a differentiable neural network module. The proposed method keeps the classical idea but learns the band coefficients from data. We present a complete mathematical framework for integrating this layer into deep learning architectures that uses softplus reparameterization to ensure positive coefficients and bounded denominators. We describe forward and backward pass algorithms enabling end to end training through backpropagation. This approach preserves the key benefits of normalized differences, namely illumination invariance and outputs bounded to $[-1,1]$ while allowing gradient descent to discover task specific band weightings. We extend the method to work with signed inputs, so the layer can be stacked inside larger architectures. Experiments show that models using this layer reach similar classification accuracy to standard multilayer perceptrons while using about 75\% fewer parameters. They also handle multiplicative noise well, at 10\% noise accuracy drops only 0.17\% versus 3.03\% for baseline MLPs. The learned coefficient patterns stay consistent across different depths.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06793v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern computer vision architectures, from CNNs to Transformers, predominantly rely on the stacking of heuristic modules: spatial mixers (Attention/Conv) followed by channel mixers (FFNs). In this work, we challenge this paradigm by returning to mathematical first principles. We propose the \textbf{Clifford Algebra Network (CAN)}, also referred to as CliffordNet, a vision backbone grounded purely in Geometric Algebra. Instead of engineering separate modules for mixing and memory, we derive a unified interaction mechanism based on the \textbf{Clifford Geometric Product} ($uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$). This operation ensures algebraic completeness regarding the Geometric Product by simultaneously capturing feature coherence (via the generalized inner product) and structural variation (via the exterior wedge product).   Implemented via an efficient sparse rolling mechanism with \textbf{strict linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(N)$}, our model reveals a surprising emergent property: the geometric interaction is so representationally dense that standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) become redundant. Empirically, CliffordNet establishes a new Pareto frontier: our \textbf{Nano} variant achieves \textbf{76.41\%} accuracy on CIFAR-100 with only \textbf{1.4M} parameters, effectively matching the heavy-weight ResNet-18 (11.2M) with \textbf{$8\times$ fewer parameters}, while our \textbf{Base} variant sets a new SOTA for tiny models at \textbf{78.05\%}. Our results suggest that global understanding can emerge solely from rigorous, algebraically complete local interactions, potentially signaling a shift where \textit{geometry is all you need}.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06806v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although learning-based vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents can learn spatial knowledge implicitly from large-scale training data, zero-shot VLN agents lack this process, relying primarily on local observations for navigation, which leads to inefficient exploration and a significant performance gap. To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Such results highlight the importance of global spatial representations for generalizable navigation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06831v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present SARA (Scene-Aware Reconstruction Accelerator), a geometry-driven pair selection module for Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Unlike conventional pipelines that select pairs based on visual similarity alone, SARA introduces geometry-first pair selection by scoring reconstruction informativeness - the product of overlap and parallax - before expensive matching. A lightweight pre-matching stage uses mutual nearest neighbors and RANSAC to estimate these cues, then constructs an Information-Weighted Spanning Tree (IWST) augmented with targeted edges for loop closure, long-baseline anchors, and weak-view reinforcement. Compared to exhaustive matching, SARA reduces rotation errors by 46.5+-5.5% and translation errors by 12.5+-6.5% across modern learned detectors, while achieving at most 50x speedup through 98% pair reduction (from 30,848 to 580 pairs). This reduces matching complexity from quadratic to quasi-linear, maintaining within +-3% of baseline reconstruction metrics for 3D Gaussian Splatting and SVRaster.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-resolution image representation is a special form of sparse representation that retains only low-frequency information while discarding high-frequency components. This property reduces storage and transmission costs and benefits various image processing tasks. However, a key challenge is to preserve essential visual content while maintaining the ability to accurately reconstruct the original images. This work proposes LR2Flow, a nonlinear framework that learns low-resolution image representations by integrating wavelet tight frame blocks with normalizing flows. We conduct a reconstruction error analysis of the proposed network, which demonstrates the necessity of designing invertible neural networks in the wavelet tight frame domain. Experimental results on various tasks, including image rescaling, compression, and denoising, demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned representations and the robustness of the proposed framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06835v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides robust all-weather imaging capabilities; however, translating SAR observations into photo-realistic optical images remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem. Current approaches are often hindered by the inherent speckle noise and geometric distortions of SAR data, which frequently result in semantic misinterpretation, ambiguous texture synthesis, and structural hallucinations. To address these limitations, a novel SAR-to-Optical (S2O) translation framework is proposed, integrating three core technical contributions: (i) Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment, which establishes an Optical-Aware SAR Encoder by distilling robust semantic priors from an Optical Teacher into a SAR Student (ii) Semantically-Grounded Generative Guidance, realized by a Semantically-Grounded ControlNet that integrates class-aware text prompts for global context with hierarchical visual prompts for local spatial guidance; and (iii) an Uncertainty-Aware Objective, which explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty to dynamically modulate the reconstruction focus, effectively mitigating artifacts caused by speckle-induced ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06839v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present PRISM, a novel color-guided stratified sampling method for RGB-LiDAR point clouds. Our approach is motivated by the observation that unique scene features often exhibit chromatic diversity while repetitive, redundant features are homogeneous in color. Conventional downsampling methods (Random Sampling, Voxel Grid, Normal Space Sampling) enforce spatial uniformity while ignoring this photometric content. In contrast, PRISM allocates sampling density proportional to chormatic diversity. By treating RGB color space as the stratification domain and imposing a maximum capacity k per color bin, the method preserves texture-rich regions with high color variation while substantially reducing visually homogeneous surfaces. This shifts the sampling space from spatial coverage to visual complexity to produce sparser point clouds that retain essential features for 3D reconstruction tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance across many tasks, yet most systems remain limited to offline inference, requiring complete inputs before generating outputs. Recent streaming methods reduce latency by interleaving perception and generation, but still enforce a sequential perception-generation cycle, limiting real-time interaction. In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency. We further show that the proposed framework yields up to 2x acceleration under balanced perception-generation workloads, establishing a principled pathway toward speak-while-watching real-time systems. We make all our code publicly available: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/Speak-While-Watching.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can generate convincing clinical narratives, yet frequently struggle to visually ground their statements. We posit this limitation arises from the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale clinical referring-localization pairs. To address this, we introduce MedGround, an automated pipeline that transforms segmentation resources into high-quality medical referring grounding data. Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples. Finally, we present MedGround-35K, a novel multimodal medical dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMs trained with MedGround-35K consistently achieve improved referring grounding performance, enhance multi-object semantic disambiguation, and exhibit strong generalization to unseen grounding settings. This work highlights MedGround as a scalable, data-driven approach to anchor medical language to verifiable visual evidence. Dataset and code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most existing 3D referring expression segmentation (3DRES) methods rely on dense, high-quality point clouds, while real-world agents such as robots and mobile phones operate with only a few sparse RGB views and strict latency constraints. We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES. Experiments show that MVGGT establishes the first strong baseline and achieves both high accuracy and fast inference, outperforming existing alternatives.

It can be instantly applied to a novel object at test time without finetuning. We design our network to meet the demands of real-world applications, emphasizing reduced memory requirements and fast inference time. Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network. Thanks to our reference image fusion strategy, we significantly decrease the number of reference images, thus decreasing the time needed to process these images and the memory required to store them. Furthermore, with our lightweight network, our method requires less inference time. Though with fewer reference images, experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that our method achieves comparable results with other methods that require more reference images and larger network parameters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06891v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) relies on Vision Transformers whose attention mechanism is susceptible to spurious correlations, and scales quadratically with resolution. To address these limitations, We present CLIMP, the first fully Mamba-based contrastive vision-language model that replaces both the vision and text encoders with Mamba. The new architecture encodes sequential structure in both vision and language, with VMamba capturing visual spatial inductive biases, reducing reliance on spurious correlations and producing an embedding space favorable for cross-modal retrieval and out-of-distribution robustness-surpassing OpenAI's CLIP-ViT-B by 7.5% on ImageNet-O. CLIMP naturally supports variable input resolutions without positional encoding interpolation or specialized training, achieving up to 6.6% higher retrieval accuracy at 16x training resolution while using 5x less memory and 1.8x fewer FLOPs. The autoregressive text encoder further overcomes CLIP's fixed context limitation, enabling dense captioning retrieval. Our findings suggest that Mamba exhibits advantageous properties for vision-language learning, making it a compelling alternative to Transformer-based CLIP.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06909v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image dehazing has witnessed significant advancements with the development of deep learning models. However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset. Our proposed solution establishes a new benchmark for depth-aware dehazing across various scenarios. Pretrained models and codes will be released at our project https://github.com/Harbinzzy/UDPNet.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06928v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conventional physically based rendering (PBR) pipelines generate photorealistic images through computationally intensive light transport simulations. Although recent deep learning approaches leverage diffusion model priors with geometry buffers (G-buffers) to produce visually compelling results without explicit scene geometry or light simulation, they remain constrained by two major limitations. First, the iterative nature of the diffusion process introduces substantial latency. Second, the inherent stochasticity of these generative models compromises physical accuracy and temporal consistency. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel, end-to-end, deterministic, single-step neural rendering framework, RenderFlow, built upon a flow matching paradigm. To further strengthen both rendering quality and generalization, we propose an efficient and effective module for sparse keyframe guidance. Our method significantly accelerates the rendering process and, by optionally incorporating sparsely rendered keyframes as guidance, enhances both the physical plausibility and overall visual quality of the output. The resulting pipeline achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic rendering quality, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of modern generative models and the precision of traditional physically based rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework by introducing a lightweight, adapter-based module that efficiently repurposes the pretrained forward model for the inverse rendering task of intrinsic decomposition.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06931v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in socially consequential settings, raising concerns about social bias driven by demographic cues. A central challenge in measuring such social bias is attribution under visual confounding: real-world images entangle race and gender with correlated factors such as background and clothing, obscuring attribution. We propose a \textbf{face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm} that isolates demographic effects while preserving real-image realism. Starting from real photographs, we generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender, keeping all other visual factors fixed. Based on this paradigm, we construct \textbf{FOCUS}, a dataset of 480 scene-matched counterfactual images across six occupations and ten demographic groups, and propose \textbf{REFLECT}, a benchmark comprising three decision-oriented tasks: two-alternative forced choice, multiple-choice socioeconomic inference, and numeric salary recommendation. Experiments on five state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that demographic disparities persist under strict visual control and vary substantially across task formulations. These findings underscore the necessity of controlled, counterfactual audits and highlight task design as a critical factor in evaluating social bias in multimodal models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In real-world video question answering scenarios, videos often provide only localized visual cues, while verifiable answers are distributed across the open web; models therefore need to jointly perform cross-frame clue extraction, iterative retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning-based verification. To bridge this gap, we construct the first video deep research benchmark, VideoDR. VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains. Further analysis indicates that goal drift and long-horizon consistency are the core bottlenecks. In sum, VideoDR provides a systematic benchmark for studying video agents in open-web settings and reveals the key challenges for next-generation video deep research agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06944v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual understanding, they often struggle when faced with the unstructured and ambiguous nature of human-generated sketches. This limitation is particularly pronounced in the underexplored task of visual grading, where models should not only solve a problem but also diagnose errors in hand-drawn diagrams. Such diagnostic capabilities depend on complex structural, semantic, and metacognitive reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SketchJudge, a novel benchmark tailored for evaluating MLLMs as graders of hand-drawn STEM diagrams. SketchJudge encompasses 1,015 hand-drawn student responses across four domains: geometry, physics, charts, and flowcharts, featuring diverse stylistic variations and distinct error types. Evaluations on SketchJudge demonstrate that even advanced MLLMs lag significantly behind humans, validating the benchmark's effectiveness in exposing the fragility of current vision-language alignment in symbolic and noisy contexts. All data, code, and evaluation scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/yuhangsu82/SketchJudge.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06965v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unified large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in general-purpose multimodal understanding and generation. However, they still operate under a ``one-size-fits-all'' paradigm and struggle to model user-specific concepts (e.g., generate a photo of \texttt{}) in a consistent and controllable manner. Existing personalization methods typically rely on external retrieval, which is inefficient and poorly integrated into unified multimodal pipelines. Recent personalized unified models introduce learnable soft prompts to encode concept information, yet they either couple understanding and generation or depend on complex multi-stage training, leading to cross-task interference and ultimately to fuzzy or misaligned personalized knowledge. We present \textbf{OmniPersona}, an end-to-end personalization framework for unified LMMs that, for the first time, integrates personalized understanding, generation, and image editing within a single architecture. OmniPersona introduces structurally decoupled concept tokens, allocating dedicated subspaces for different tasks to minimize interference, and incorporates an explicit knowledge replay mechanism that propagates personalized attribute knowledge across tasks, enabling consistent personalized behavior. To systematically evaluate unified personalization, we propose \textbf{\texttt{OmniPBench}}, extending the public UnifyBench concept set with personalized editing tasks and cross-task evaluation protocols integrating understanding, generation, and editing. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPersona delivers competitive and robust performance across diverse personalization tasks. We hope OmniPersona will serve as a strong baseline and spur further research on controllable, unified personalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose capabilities, yet still struggle on Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC), a core perception task that requires subtle visual discrimination and is crucial for many real-world applications. A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our findings and the proposed ReFine-RFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07001v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate molecular subtype classification is essential for personalized breast cancer treatment, yet conventional immunohistochemical analysis relies on invasive biopsies and is prone to sampling bias. Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enables non-invasive tumor characterization, clinical workflows typically acquire only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast agent dose. In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches. Experiments on a dataset of 960 cases (886 internal cases split 7:1:2 for training/validation/testing, and 74 external cases evaluated via five-fold cross-validation) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 0.893, 0.824, and 0.857 for ER, PR, and HER2 classification, respectively, and a mean absolute error of 8.2\% for Ki-67 regression, significantly outperforming radiomics and single-task deep learning baselines. These results indicate the feasibility of accurate, non-invasive molecular subtype prediction using standard imaging protocols.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07056v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables accurate disease diagnosis by capturing rich spectral-spatial tissue information, but recent advances in deep learning have exposed its vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we identify two fundamental causes of this fragility: the reliance on local pixel dependencies for preserving tissue structure and the dependence on multiscale spectral-spatial representations for hierarchical feature encoding. Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible. Compared with existing methods, our approach reveals the unique vulnerabilities of medical HSI models and underscores the need for robust, structure-aware defenses in clinical applications.

This study introduces a fully automated pipeline for billboard detection and driver gaze duration estimation, aiming to evaluate billboard relevance without reliance on manual annotations or eye-tracking devices. Our pipeline operates in two stages: (1) a YOLO-based object detection model trained on Mapillary Vistas and fine-tuned on BillboardLamac images achieved 94% mAP@50 in the billboard detection task (2) a classifier based on the detected bounding box positions and DINOv2 features. The proposed pipeline enables estimation of billboard driver gaze duration from individual frames. We show that our method is able to achieve 68.1% accuracy on BillboardLamac when considering individual frames. These results are further validated using images collected from Google Street View.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07092v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving increasingly relies on Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable vehicles to understand complex surroundings by analyzing visual inputs and textual queries. Currently, a paramount concern for VQA in this domain is the stringent requirement for fast latency and real-time processing, as delays directly impact real-world safety in this safety-critical application. However, current state-of-the-art VQA models, particularly large vision-language models (VLMs), often prioritize performance over computational efficiency. These models typically process dense patch tokens for every frame, leading to prohibitive computational costs (FLOPs) and significant inference latency, especially with long video sequences. This focus limits their practical deployment in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient VLM framework for autonomous driving VQA tasks, SRC-Pipeline. It learns to compress early frame tokens into a small number of high-level tokens while retaining full patch tokens for recent frames. Experiments on autonomous driving video question answering tasks show that our approach achieves 66% FLOPs reduction while maintaining comparable performance, enabling VLMs to operate more effectively in real-time, safety-critical autonomous driving settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise that degrades image quality and diagnostic reliability. Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, WCC-Net improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE). Moreover, WCC-Net generalizes robustly to unseen dose levels (1/50 and 1/4), achieving superior quantitative performance and improved volumetric anatomical consistency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on general image understanding but struggle to think with medical images, especially when performing multi-step reasoning through iterative visual interaction. Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastructure to learn effective tool selection, invocation, and coordination in multi-modal medical reasoning. We introduce MedVistaGym, a scalable and interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning for medical image analysis. MedVistaGym equips VLMs to determine when and which tools to invoke, localize task-relevant image regions, and integrate single or multiple sub-image evidence into interleaved multimodal reasoning within a unified, executable interface for agentic training. Using MedVistaGym, we train MedVistaGym-R1 to interleave tool use with agentic reasoning through trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Across six medical VQA benchmarks, MedVistaGym-R1-8B exceeds comparably sized tool-augmented baselines by 19.10% to 24.21%, demonstrating that structured agentic training--not tool access alone--unlocks effective tool-integrated reasoning for medical image analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally learn models from a small amount of novel data, which requires strong representation and adaptation ability of models learned under few-example supervision to avoid catastrophic forgetting on old classes and overfitting to novel classes. This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

To bridge this gap, we propose a real-time motion focus recognition method that estimates the subject's locomotion intention from any egocentric video. Our approach leverages the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduces system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference. Evaluated on a collected egocentric action dataset, our method achieves real-time performance with manageable memory consumption through a sliding batch inference strategy. This work makes motion-centric analysis practical for edge deployment and offers a complementary perspective to existing egocentric studies on sports and fast-movement activities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable learning on low-quality multimodal data is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications. However, multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain and leads existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to reliably remove heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection is crucial for mitigating adversarial misinformation. Existing methods, relying on static fusion or LLMs, face computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations. To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning. Experiments on Weibo, Weibo21, and GossipCop demonstrate that DIVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 2.72\%, while optimizing inference efficiency with a reduced latency of 4.12 s.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07181v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to human-computer interaction, yet automating complex GUI tasks remains a major challenge for autonomous agents, largely due to a lack of scalable, high-quality training data. While recordings of human demonstrations offer a rich data source, they are typically long, unstructured, and lack annotations, making them difficult for agents to learn from.To address this, we introduce ShowUI-Aloha, a comprehensive pipeline that transforms unstructured, in-the-wild human screen recordings from desktop environments into structured, actionable tasks. Our framework includes four key components: A recorder that captures screen video along with precise user interactions like mouse clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls. A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions. A planner that reads the parsed demonstrations, maintains task states, and dynamically formulates the next high-level action plan based on contextual reasoning. An executor that faithfully carries out these action plans at the OS level, performing precise clicks, drags, text inputs, and window operations with safety checks and real-time feedback. Together, these components provide a scalable solution for collecting and parsing real-world human data, demonstrating a viable path toward building general-purpose GUI agents that can learn effectively from simply observing humans.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07209v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Glass surfaces create complex interactions of reflected and transmitted light, making single-image reflection removal (SIRR) challenging. Existing datasets suffer from limited physical realism in synthetic data or insufficient scale in real captures. We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training. This enables our approach to achieve improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present SceneNAT, a single-stage masked non-autoregressive Transformer that synthesizes complete 3D indoor scenes from natural language instructions through only a few parallel decoding passes, offering improved performance and efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches. SceneNAT is trained via masked modeling over fully discretized representations of both semantic and spatial attributes. By applying a masking strategy at both the attribute level and the instance level, the model can better capture intra-object and inter-object structure. To boost relational reasoning, SceneNAT employs a dedicated triplet predictor for modeling the scene's layout and object relationships by mapping a set of learnable relation queries to a sparse set of symbolic triplets (subject, predicate, object). Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset demonstrate that SceneNAT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in both semantic compliance and spatial arrangement accuracy, while operating with substantially lower computational cost.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State-of-the-art text-based image editing models often struggle to balance background preservation with semantic consistency, frequently resulting either in the synthesis of entirely new images or in outputs that fail to realize the intended edits. In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-domain image-to-image translation re quires grounding semantic differences ex pressed in natural language prompts into corresponding visual transformations, while preserving unrelated structural and seman tic content. Existing methods struggle to maintain structural integrity and provide fine grained, attribute-specific control, especially when multiple domains are involved. We propose LACE (Language-grounded Attribute Controllable Translation), built on two compo nents: (1) a GLIP-Adapter that fuses global semantics with local structural features to pre serve consistency, and (2) a Multi-Domain Control Guidance mechanism that explicitly grounds the semantic delta between source and target prompts into per-attribute translation vec tors, aligning linguistic semantics with domain level visual changes. Together, these modules enable compositional multi-domain control with independent strength modulation for each attribute. Experiments on CelebA(Dialog) and BDD100K demonstrate that LACE achieves high visual fidelity, structural preservation, and interpretable domain-specific control, surpass ing prior baselines. This positions LACE as a cross-modal content generation framework bridging language semantics and controllable visual translation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stable Diffusion (SD) often produces degraded outputs when the training dataset contains adversarial noise. Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak. UDAP also generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-driven landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) typically relies on landslide conditioning factors (LCFs), whose availability, heterogeneity, and preprocessing-related uncertainties can constrain mapping reliability. Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retargeting motion between characters with different skeleton structures is a fundamental challenge in computer animation. When source and target characters have vastly different bone arrangements, maintaining the original motion's semantics and quality becomes increasingly difficult. We present PALUM, a novel approach that learns common motion representations across diverse skeleton topologies by partitioning joints into semantic body parts and applying attention mechanisms to capture spatio-temporal relationships. Our method transfers motion to target skeletons by leveraging these skeleton-agnostic representations alongside target-specific structural information. To ensure robust learning and preserve motion fidelity, we introduce a cycle consistency mechanism that maintains semantic coherence throughout the retargeting process. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in handling diverse skeletal structures while maintaining motion realism and semantic fidelity, even when generalizing to previously unseen skeleton-motion combinations. We will make our implementation publicly available to support future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents GenDet, a novel framework that redefines object detection as an image generation task. In contrast to traditional approaches, GenDet adopts a pioneering approach by leveraging generative modeling: it conditions on the input image and directly generates bounding boxes with semantic annotations in the original image space. GenDet establishes a conditional generation architecture built upon the large-scale pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, formulating the detection task as semantic constraints within the latent space. It enables precise control over bounding box positions and category attributes, while preserving the flexibility of the generative model. This novel methodology effectively bridges the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for constructing unified visual understanding systems. Systematic experiments demonstrate that GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors, while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video from a reference image and a text prompt. This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\%).

To facilitate the development of fine-grained spatial and temporal localization capabilities, we curate LoomData-8.7k, a human-centric video dataset with temporally grounded and spatially localized captions. With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&amp;F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects. Collectively, these contributions offer a universal and effective suite for joint spatial-temporal video understanding, setting a new standard in multimodal intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07291v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (96.88% AUC) and robust attack resilience (99.3%) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multimodal watermarking.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07293v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While inference-time scaling has significantly enhanced generative quality in large language and diffusion models, its application to vector-quantized (VQ) visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) remains unexplored. We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at single-image understanding, they exhibit significantly degraded performance in multi-image reasoning scenarios. Multi-image reasoning presents fundamental challenges including complex inter-relationships between images and scattered critical information across image sets. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose the Cognition-Inspired Meta-Action Framework (CINEMA), a novel approach that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions: Global, Focus, Hint, Think, and Answer which explicitly modeling the sequential cognitive steps humans naturally employ. For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks. Our model surpasses GPT-4o on the MUIR and MVMath benchmarks and notably outperforms specialized video reasoning models on video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our human cognition-inspired reasoning framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07310v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a core component of deep learning models, with Channel Attention and Spatial Attention being the two most representative architectures. Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a "data scale-method-performance" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the "Channel-Multi-scale Spatial" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the "Spatial-Channel" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 6D object pose estimation plays a crucial role in scene understanding for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.

We propose a reconstruction-guided few-shot network (RGFS-Net) that enhances generalization to unseen classes while preserving consistency for seen categories. Our method incorporates a masked image reconstruction task, where parts of the input are occluded and reconstructed to encourage semantically rich feature learning. This auxiliary task strengthens spatial understanding and improves class discrimination under low-data settings. We evaluated the efficacy of EuroSAT and PatternNet datasets under 1-shot and 5-shot protocols, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines. The proposed method is simple, effective, and compatible with standard backbones, offering a robust solution for few-shot remote sensing classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in medical multi-modal models focus on specialized image analysis like dermatology, pathology, or radiology. However, they do not fully capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics, which involve heterogeneous inputs and require ongoing contextual understanding during patient-physician interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, their internal reasoning often exhibits a critical inconsistency: although deeper layers may attend to the correct visual regions, final predictions are frequently misled by noisy attention from earlier layers. This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released upon publication.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07366v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating structured narrations for real-world e-commerce videos requires models to perceive fine-grained visual details and organize them into coherent, high-level stories--capabilities that existing approaches struggle to unify. We introduce the E-commerce Hierarchical Video Captioning (E-HVC) dataset with dual-granularity, temporally grounded annotations: a Temporal Chain-of-Thought that anchors event-level observations and Chapter Summary that compose them into concise, story-centric summaries. Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence. To enable efficient training while reducing input tokens, we propose the Scene-Primed ASR-anchored Compressor (SPA-Compressor), which compresses multimodal tokens into hierarchical scene and event representations guided by ASR semantic cues. Built upon these designs, our HiVid-Narrator framework achieves superior narrative quality with fewer input tokens compared to existing methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07377v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we present a new dynamic collaborative network for semi-supervised 3D vessel segmentation, termed DiCo. Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies. Experiments demonstrate that our DiCo method sets new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks. The code repository address is https://github.com/xujiaommcome/DiCo

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07396v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have achieved unprecedented quality in image and video generation, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally prohibitive. To accelerate inference, feature caching methods have emerged by reusing intermediate representations across timesteps. However, existing caching approaches treat all feature components uniformly. We reveal that DiT feature spaces contain distinct principal and residual subspaces with divergent temporal behavior: the principal subspace evolves smoothly and predictably, while the residual subspace exhibits volatile, low-energy oscillations that resist accurate prediction. Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention. Our code is in supplementary material and will be released on Github.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07416v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents unique challenges due to its high spectral dimensionality and limited labeled data. Traditional deep learning models often suffer from overfitting and high computational costs. Self-distillation (SD), a variant of knowledge distillation where a network learns from its own predictions, has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance model performance without requiring external teacher networks. In this work, we explore the application of SD to HSI by treating earlier outputs as soft targets, thereby enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions. This process improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the learned feature space. Our approach is validated on two benchmark HSI datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of SD for spectral-spatial learning. Codes are available at https://github.com/Prachet-Dev-Singh/SDHSI.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07447v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing image foundation models are not optimized for spherical images having been trained primarily on perspective images. PanoSAMic integrates the pre-trained Segment Anything (SAM) encoder to make use of its extensive training and integrate it into a semantic segmentation model for panoramic images using multiple modalities. We modify the SAM encoder to output multi-stage features and introduce a novel spatio-modal fusion module that allows the model to select the relevant modalities and best features from each modality for different areas of the input. Furthermore, our semantic decoder uses spherical attention and dual view fusion to overcome the distortions and edge discontinuity often associated with panoramic images.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07459v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models enhance understanding and interaction with audiovisual content, making it more accessible, searchable, and useful for a wide range of fields such as education, surveillance, entertainment, and content creation. Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \textbf{4\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question. We opine that such query-based frame selection can enhance accuracy in a wide range of tasks that rely on only a subset of video frames.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Transformers achieve impressive generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to iterative sampling. Recently, dynamic resolution sampling has emerged as a promising acceleration technique by reducing the resolution of early sampling steps. However, existing methods rely on heuristic re-noising at every resolution transition, injecting noise that breaks cross-stage consistency and forces the model to relearn global structure. In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models. Our code is in supplementary material and will be released on Github.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reading order detection is the foundation of document understanding. Most existing methods rely on uniform supervision, implicitly assuming a constant difficulty distribution across layout regions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by revealing a critical flaw: \textbf{Positional Disparity}, a phenomenon where models demonstrate mastery over the deterministic start and end regions but suffer a performance collapse in the complex intermediate sections. This degradation arises because standard training allows the massive volume of easy patterns to drown out the learning signals from difficult layouts. To address this, we propose \textbf{FocalOrder}, a framework driven by \textbf{Focal Preference Optimization (FPO)}. Specifically, FocalOrder employs adaptive difficulty discovery with exponential moving average mechanism to dynamically pinpoint hard-to-learn transitions, while introducing a difficulty-calibrated pairwise ranking objective to enforce global logical consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocalOrder establishes new state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench v1.0 and Comp-HRDoc. Our compact model not only outperforms competitive specialized baselines but also significantly surpasses large-scale general VLMs. These results demonstrate that aligning the optimization with intrinsic structural ambiguity of documents is critical for mastering complex document structures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07499v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) tooth segmentation from Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a prerequisite for digital dental workflows. However, achieving high-fidelity segmentation remains challenging due to adhesion artifacts in naturally occluded scans, which are caused by low contrast and indistinct inter-arch boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose the Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet), a coarse-to-fine framework designed to resolve boundary ambiguity while maintaining global structural consistency. Specifically, we introduce two mechanisms: the Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) and the Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA). The AGBR employs an entropy based gating mechanism to perform targeted feature rectification in high uncertainty transition zones. Meanwhile, the SDMAA integrates implicit geometric constraints via signed distance map to enforce topological consistency, preventing the loss of spatial details associated with standard pooling. Experimental results on a dataset of 125 CBCT volumes demonstrate that AACNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17 \% and a 95\% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63 mm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization on an external dataset with an HD95 of 2.19 mm, validating its reliability for downstream clinical applications such as surgical planning. Code for AACNet is available at https://github.com/shiliu0114/AACNet.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Immersive telepresence aims to transform human interaction in AR/VR applications by enabling lifelike full-body holographic representations for enhanced remote collaboration. However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07540v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multi-view images to ensure accurate perception and robust decision-making. To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.   We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.   Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.

However, current methods suffer from limited multi-view data and poor generalization to new viewpoints. We introduce BenchSeg, a novel multi-view food video segmentation dataset and benchmark. BenchSeg aggregates 55 dish scenes (from Nutrition5k, Vegetables & Fruits, MetaFood3D, and FoodKit) with 25,284 meticulously annotated frames, capturing each dish under free 360{\deg} camera motion. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis. We release BenchSeg to foster future research. The project page including the dataset annotations and the food segmentation models can be found at https://amughrabi.github.io/benchseg.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are a major cause of cancer-related mortality, and reliable detection on CT remains challenging in multi-centre settings. We developed a foundation model-based AI pipeline for patient-level classification and lesion-level detection of CRLM on contrast-enhanced CT, integrating uncertainty quantification and explainability. CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles. Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases. These results demonstrate that foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We derive the likelihood of a raw signal in a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD), given a fixed photon flux. The raw signal comprises timing of detection events, which are nonlinearly related to the flux. Moreover, they are naturally stochastic. We then derive a score function of the signal. This is a key for solving inverse problems based on SPAD signals. We focus on deriving solutions involving a diffusion model, to express image priors. We demonstrate the effect of low or high photon counts, and the consequence of exploiting timing of detection events.

Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings. Project page: https://zijian-wu.github.io/uika-page/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07620v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Document layout analysis aims to detect and categorize structural elements (e.g., titles, tables, figures) in scanned or digital documents. Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features. Second, we design a Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) to refine predictions by modeling contextual relationships through a dynamically constructed layout graph. Extensive experiments show PARL achieves state-of-the-art results. It establishes a new benchmark for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and, notably, surpasses even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. Crucially, PARL (65M) is highly efficient, using roughly four times fewer parameters than large multimodal models (256M), demonstrating that sophisticated visual structure modeling can be both more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07632v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07660v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present StdGEN++, a novel and comprehensive system for generating high-fidelity, semantically decomposed 3D characters from diverse inputs. Existing 3D generative methods often produce monolithic meshes that lack the structural flexibility required by industrial pipelines in gaming and animation. Addressing this gap, StdGEN++ is built upon a Dual-branch Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (Dual-Branch S-LRM), which jointly reconstructs geometry, color, and per-component semantics in a feed-forward manner. To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement. Crucially, the resulting structural independence unlocks advanced downstream capabilities, including non-destructive editing, physics-compliant animation, and gaze tracking, making it a robust solution for automated character asset production.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition has advanced with the development of contrastive learning methods. However, most of contrastive paradigms are inherently discriminative and often struggle to capture the variability and uncertainty intrinsic to human motion. To address this issue, we propose a variational contrastive learning framework that integrates probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive self-supervised learning. This formulation enables the learning of structured and semantically meaningful representations that generalize across different datasets and supervision levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes. Moreover, qualitative analyses show that the features provided by our method are more relevant given the motion and sample characteristics, with more focus on important skeleton joints, when compared to the other methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition is a frequent research topic due to its wide-ranging practical applications. While recent studies use synthetic images to improve License Plate Recognition (LPR) results, there remain several limitations in these efforts. This work addresses these constraints by comprehensively exploring the integration of real and synthetic data to enhance LPR performance. We subject 16 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to a benchmarking process involving 12 public datasets acquired from various regions. Several key findings emerge from our investigation. Primarily, the massive incorporation of synthetic data substantially boosts model performance in both intra- and cross-dataset scenarios. We examine three distinct methodologies for generating synthetic data: template-based generation, character permutation, and utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, each contributing significantly to performance enhancement. The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed among different models, identifying those that strike the optimal balance in each intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings.

Specifically, we (i) align intermediate features of our generative model with self-supervised 3D features, which substantially improves generation quality; (ii) transfer knowledge from large-scale image-pretrained generative models to LiDAR generation, mitigating limited LiDAR datasets; and (iii) enable point cloud control at inference for object inpainting and scene mixing with solely an unconditional model. On the KITTI-360 benchmark R3DPA achieves state of the art performance. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/R3DPA.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical bottleneck in achieving precise numerical prediction for 3D scene understanding. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes "near-miss" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07700v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It has been demonstrated in various contexts that monotonicity leads to better explainability in neural networks. However, not every function can be well approximated by a monotone neural network. We demonstrate that monotonicity can still be used in two ways to boost explainability. First, we use an adaptation of the decomposition of a trained ReLU network into two monotone and convex parts, thereby overcoming numerical obstacles from an inherent blowup of the weights in this procedure. Our proposed saliency methods -- SplitCAM and SplitLRP -- improve on state of the art results on both VGG16 and Resnet18 networks on ImageNet-S across all Quantus saliency metric categories. Second, we exhibit that training a model as the difference between two monotone neural networks results in a system with strong self-explainability properties.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a method for carrying fair comparisons of the accuracy of pose estimation using fiducial markers. These comparisons rely on large sets of high-fidelity synthetic images enabling deep exploration of the 6 degrees of freedom. A low-discrepancy sampling of the space allows to check the correlations between each degree of freedom and the pose errors by plotting the 36 pairs of combinations. The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy. This method is applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation. The code is open source and available on GitHub.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07737v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose UAIT (Uncommon-sense Action Image-Text) dataset, a new evaluation benchmark designed to test the semantic understanding ability of visual language models (VLMs) in uncommon-sense action scenes. Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work we analyse a number of variants of the Wasserstein distance which allow to focus the classification on the prescribed parts (fragments) of classified 2D curves. These variants are based on the use of a number of discrete probability measures which reflect the importance of given fragments of curves. The performance of this approach is tested through a series of experiments related to the clustering analysis of 2D curves performed on data coming from the field of archaeology.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07761v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face a fundamental dilemma in video reasoning: they are caught between the prohibitive computational costs of verbose reasoning and the hallucination risks of efficient, ungrounded approaches. To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works such as REPA have shown that guiding diffusion models with external semantic features (e.g., DINO) can significantly accelerate the training of diffusion transformers (DiTs). However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models. Our method is not only more flexible for different backbones but also has the potential to be adopted for a wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks. The source code of our method can be found at https://github.com/csslc/Self-Transcendence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The European Space Agency (ESA), driven by its ambitions on planned lunar missions with the Argonaut lander, has a profound interest in reliable crater detection, since craters pose a risk to safe lunar landings. This task is usually addressed with automated crater detection algorithms (CDA) based on deep learning techniques. It is non-trivial due to the vast amount of craters of various sizes and shapes, as well as challenging conditions such as varying illumination and rugged terrain. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks. For fine-tuning, we utilize a manually labeled dataset fom the IMPACT project, that provides crater annotations on high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Calibrated Data Record images. We insert trainable parameters using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy with Low-Rank Adaptation, and optimize a combined loss function consisting of Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) for localization and a contrastive loss for classification. We achieve satisfactory visual results, along with a maximum recall of 94.0% and a maximum precision of 73.1% on a test dataset from IMPACT. Our method achieves reliable crater detection across challenging lunar imaging conditions, paving the way for robust crater analysis in future lunar exploration.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07805v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Remote sensing change detection fundamentally relies on the effective fusion and discrimination of bi-temporal features. Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion. Code and full training and evaluation protocols will be released at https://github.com/dyzy41/open-rscd.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07812v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their proficiency in understanding and reasoning over multiple images remains largely unexplored. While existing benchmarks have initiated the evaluation of multi-image models, a comprehensive analysis of their core weaknesses and their causes is still lacking. In this work, we introduce MIMIC (Multi-Image Model Insights and Challenges), a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multi-image capabilities of LVLMs. Using MIMIC, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments that reveal pervasive issues: LVLMs often fail to aggregate information across images and struggle to track or attend to multiple concepts simultaneously. To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks. Data and code will be made available at https://github.com/anurag-198/MIMIC.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07833v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06036v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable framework that embeds the axiomatic structure of Random Utility Models (RUM) directly into deep neural networks. Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively "whitens" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this "Axioms-as-Layers" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While accurate traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), effectively communicating predicted conditions via natural language for human-centric decision support remains a challenge and is often handled separately. To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality. By unifying prediction and description generation, CrossTrafficLLM delivers a more interpretable, and actionable approach to generative traffic intelligence, offering significant advantages for modern ITS applications.

Long convolutions enable efficient global context mixing, but requirements for intermediate results exceed the 2-3 MB Block RAM capacity of FPGAs. We present a chunked FFT convolution approach enabling 450K length sequence by 450K length filter convolutions on an Alveo U200 FPGA with 2.8 MB BRAM through chunking and overlap-add reconstruction. We find that throughput scales proportionally with chunk size while degrading minimally by 7% for our longest sequences, demonstrating that careful memory management enables deployment of long-context primitives on edge FPGAs without sacrificing performance.

The method computes Hessian-inverse-vector products without storing the Hessian or its inverse in time and storage that scale linearly in the number of layers. Compared to the naive approach of first computing the Hessian, then solving the linear system, which takes storage that's quadratic in the number of parameters and cubically many operations, our Hessian-inverse-vector product method scales roughly like Pearlmutter's algorithm for computing Hessian-vector products.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06100v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a theory-first framework that interprets inference-time adaptation in large language models (LLMs) as online Bayesian state estimation. Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.   This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.   The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a controlled study of how dataset contamination interacts with the post-training stages now standard in large language model training pipelines. Starting from clean checkpoints of Qwen2.5 (0.5B/1.5B) and Gemma3 (1B/4B), we inject five copies of GSM8K and MBPP test items into the first 2B tokens of an otherwise 25B token extended pre-training dataset. We then compare the contaminated and clean models both immediately after pre-training and again after two popular post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). The applied post-training steps do not have any contamination. Across math and coding benchmarks, we find three consistent patterns: (i) Contamination causes performance spikes that are gradually diminished with continued pre-training. After even 25B tokens the apparent performance inflation of contamination can become close to zero. (ii) Both SFT and GRPO resurface the leaked information, but with different external validity: SFT inflates scores only on the contaminated tasks, whereas GRPO also inflates performance on uncontaminated counterparts (GSMPlus, HumanEval). (iii) Model scale amplifies these tendencies, larger Supervised Fine Tuned models memorize more, while larger GRPO models translate leakage into more generalizable capabilities. Our results underscore the need for contamination audits \emph{after} post-training and suggest that RL-based post-training, although not immune, can help alleviate contamination-related over-estimation problems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bushfires are among the most destructive natural hazards in Australia, causing significant ecological, economic, and social damage. Accurate prediction of bushfire intensity is therefore essential for effective disaster preparedness and response. This study examines the predictive capability of spatio-temporal environmental data for identifying high-risk bushfire zones across Australia. We integrated historical fire events from NASA FIRMS, daily meteorological observations from Meteostat, and vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Google Earth Engine for the period 2015-2023. After harmonizing the datasets using spatial and temporal joins, we evaluated several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and an ensemble classifier. Under a binary classification framework distinguishing 'low' and 'high' fire risk, the ensemble approach achieved an accuracy of 87%. The results demonstrate that combining multi-source environmental features with advanced machine learning techniques can produce reliable bushfire intensity predictions, supporting more informed and timely disaster management.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time-series models achieve strong predictive performance in healthcare, industry, energy, and finance, but how they combine cross-variable interactions with temporal dynamics remains unclear. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are widely used for interpretation. However, existing time-series variants typically treat the feature and time axes independently, fragmenting structural signals formed jointly by multiple variables over specific intervals. We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets. A financial case study shows that GS-SHAP identifies interpretable multivariate-temporal interactions among key market variables during high-volatility regimes.

We evaluate the robustness of tree-based classifiers at an unprecedented scale, utilizing ten billion deterministic samples and five billion adversarial counterexamples. Our framework introduces three primary contributions:   first, a high-throughput pipeline that reformulates Pythagorean triple generation into a single-parameter index stream, significantly improving computational efficiency over classical methods;   second, the Hypothesis-driven Negative Dataset (HND), which categorizes nine classes of adversarial attacks designed to exploit both arithmetic precision and structural patterns; and   third, a fault-tolerant infrastructure for reliable large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that while LightGBM achieves 99.99% accuracy, feature attribution reveals that the model prioritizes underlying quadratic patterns over direct algebraic verification.   These findings suggest that learned heuristics can effectively identify structural representations in numerical data, potentially serving as efficient preprocessors for formal verification methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research highlights the potential of machine learning models to learn to complement (L2C) human strengths; however, generalizing this capability to unseen users remains a significant challenge. Existing L2C methods oversimplify interaction between human and AI by relying on a single, global user model that neglects individual user variability, leading to suboptimal cooperative performance. Addressing this, we introduce L2CU, a novel L2C framework for human-AI cooperative classification with unseen users. Given sparse and noisy user annotations, L2CU identifies representative annotator profiles capturing distinct labeling patterns. By matching unseen users to these profiles, L2CU leverages profile-specific models to complement the user and achieve superior joint accuracy. We evaluate L2CU on datasets (CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, Chaoyang and AgNews), demonstrating its effectiveness as a model-agnostic solution for improving human-AI cooperative classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06123v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving increasingly complex problems with large language models (LLMs) necessitates a move beyond individual models and towards multi-model systems that can effectively collaborate. While text has traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange is possible if models can access each other's internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models. Our work represents a significant step towards a future where models can fluidly share knowledge and capabilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate roadway travel-time prediction is foundational to transportation systems analysis, yet widespread reliance on either data-intensive congestion models or overly na\"ive heuristics limits scalability and practical adoption in engineering workflows. This paper develops a lightweight estimator for minimally-congested car travel times that integrates open road-network data, speed constraints, and sparse control/turn features within a random forest framework to correct bias from shortest-path traversal-time baselines. Using an urban testbed, the pipeline: (i) constructs drivable networks from volunteered geographic data; (ii) solves Dijkstra routes minimizing edge traversal time; (iii) derives sparse operational features (signals, stops, crossings, yield, roundabouts; left/right/slight/U-turn counts); and (iv) trains a regression ensemble on limited high-quality reference times to generalize predictions beyond the training set. Out-of-sample evaluation demonstrates marked improvements over traversal-time baselines across mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, relative bias, and explained variance, with no significant mean bias under minimally congested conditions and consistent k-fold stability indicating negligible overfitting. The resulting approach offers a practical middle ground for transportation engineering: it preserves point-to-point fidelity at metropolitan scale, reduces resource requirements, and supplies defensible performance estimates where congestion feeds are inaccessible or cost-prohibitive, supporting planning, accessibility, and network performance applications under low-traffic operating regimes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are vital for maritime domain awareness, yet they often suffer from domain shifts, data sparsity, and class imbalance, which hinder the performance of predictive models. In this paper, we propose a robust data augmentation method, AISCycleGen, based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN), which is tailored for AIS datasets. Unlike traditional methods, AISCycleGen leverages unpaired domain translation to generate high-fidelity synthetic AIS data sequences without requiring paired source-target data. The framework employs a 1D convolutional generator with adaptive noise injection to preserve the spatiotemporal structure of AIS trajectories, enhancing the diversity and realism of the generated data. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply AISCycleGen to several baseline regression models, showing improvements in performance across various maritime domains. The results indicate that AISCycleGen outperforms contemporary GAN-based augmentation techniques, achieving a PSNR value of 30.5 and an FID score of 38.9. These findings underscore AISCycleGen's potential as an effective and generalizable solution for augmenting AIS datasets, improving downstream model performance in real-world maritime intelligence applications.

This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families -- Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods -- based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness. Our analysis identifies key findings regarding the fundamental trade-offs inherent in each algorithmic family, particularly concerning sample efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we reveal critical computational and algorithmic bottlenecks that currently limit the practical deployment of online DPRL. Based on these findings, we provide concrete guidelines for algorithm selection tailored to specific operational constraints and outline promising future research directions to advance the field toward more general and scalable robotic learning systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06134v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work introduces Adaptive Density Fields (ADF), a geometric attention framework that formulates spatial aggregation as a query-conditioned, metric-induced attention operator in continuous space. By reinterpreting spatial influence as geometry-preserving attention grounded in physical distance, ADF bridges concepts from adaptive kernel methods and attention mechanisms. Scalability is achieved via FAISS-accelerated inverted file indices, treating approximate nearest-neighbor search as an intrinsic component of the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the framework through a case study on aircraft trajectory analysis in the Chengdu region, extracting trajectory-conditioned Zones of Influence (ZOI) to reveal recurrent airspace structures and localized deviations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06137v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) station-based Precipitation Nowcasting aims to predict rainfall within the next 0-6 hours by leveraging a GNSS station's historical observations of precipitation, GNSS-PWV, and related meteorological variables, which is crucial for disaster mitigation and real-time decision-making. In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains. Comprehensive statistical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the major cause of death globally, calling for predictive models that not only handle diverse and high-dimensional biomedical signals but also maintain interpretability and privacy. We create a single multimodal learning framework that integrates cross modal transformers with graph neural networks and causal representation learning to measure personalized CVD risk. The model combines genomic variation, cardiac MRI, ECG waveforms, wearable streams, and structured EHR data to predict risk while also implementing causal invariance constraints across different clinical subpopulations.   To maintain transparency, we employ SHAP based feature attribution, counterfactual explanations and causal latent alignment for understandable risk factors. Besides, we position the design in a federated, privacy, preserving optimization protocol and establish rules for convergence, calibration and uncertainty quantification under distributional shift. Experimental studies based on large-scale biobank and multi institutional datasets reveal state discrimination and robustness, exhibiting fair performance across demographic strata and clinically distinct cohorts. This study paves the way for a principled approach to clinically trustworthy, interpretable and privacy respecting CVD prediction at the population level.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06147v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Meta-learning methods for regression like Neural (Diffusion) Processes achieve impressive results, but with these models it can be difficult to incorporate expert prior knowledge and information contained in metadata. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on giant corpora including varied real-world regression datasets alongside their descriptions and metadata, leading to impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks. Recent work has extended this to regression tasks and is able to leverage such prior knowledge and metadata, achieving surprisingly good performance, but this still rarely matches dedicated meta-learning methods. Here we introduce a general method for sampling from a product-of-experts of a diffusion or flow matching model and an `expert' with binned probability density; we apply this to combine neural diffusion processes with LLM token probabilities for regression (which may incorporate textual knowledge), exceeding the empirical performance of either alone.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06149v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) is widely used for fetal monitoring during labor, yet its interpretation suffers from high inter-observer variability and limited predictive accuracy. Deep learning approaches have been constrained by the scarcity of CTG recordings with clinical outcome labels. We present the first application of self-supervised pre-training to intrapartum CTG analysis, leveraging 2,444 hours of unlabeled recordings for masked pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the 552-recording CTU-UHB benchmark. Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal. We release standardized dataset splits and model weights to enable reproducible benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training can address data scarcity in fetal monitoring, offering a path toward reliable decision support in the labor room.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structured extraction with LLMs fails in production not because models lack understanding, but because output formatting is unreliable across models and prompts. A prompt that returns clean JSON on GPT-4 may produce fenced, prose-wrapped, or malformed output on Llama, causing strict parsers to reject otherwise correct extractions. We formalize this as format collapse and introduce a dual-metric evaluation framework: ROS (strict parsing, measuring operational reliability) and CSS (post-canonicalization, measuring semantic capability). On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, we find severe format collapse (for example, Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 versus CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). We then present PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight verifier (DistilBERT) and a safe-override policy. PromptPort recovers format failures (plus 6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (plus 14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 versus 0.896 in zero-shot) without modifying base models. The method generalizes to held-out model families and provides explicit abstention when uncertain, enabling reliable structured extraction in production deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is still largely static: after training, the policy is frozen. DPO, GRPO methods typically imprint one behavior into the weights, leaving little runtime control beyond prompt hacks or expensive re-alignment. We introduce ECLIPTICA, which treats alignment as instruction-driven and runtime-controllable: natural-language alignment instructions act as an explicit behavioral contract (stance, refusal boundary, verbosity) that modulates behavior on the fly under evolving safety requirements, user roles, and governance constraints.   We introduce CITA (Contrastive Instruction-Tuned Alignment), combining SFT with contrastive preference optimization under an explicit geometric anchor to a reference model. This yields a stable Riemannian chart and keeps instruction updates within a shared neighborhood, so regimes stay nearby and traversable for reliable switching.   To isolate policy switching from ordinary instruction following, we release the ECLIPTICA benchmark: 3000 controlled cases (300 prompts x 10 instruction types) where the user request is fixed and only the alignment instruction changes. On Llama-3.1-8B across five suites (ECLIPTICA, TruthfulQA, Conditional Safety, Length Control, LITMUS), CITA reaches 86.7% instruction-alignment efficiency, beating DPO (56.1%), GRPO (36.1%), and PPO (20.4%).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06159v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the context of personalized medicine, machine learning algorithms are growing in popularity. These algorithms require substantial information, which can be acquired effectively through the usage of previously gathered data. Open data and the utilization of synthetization techniques have been proposed to address this. In this paper, we propose and evaluate alternative approach that uses additional simulated data based on summary statistics published in the literature. The simulated data are used to pretrain random forests, which are afterwards fine-tuned on a real dataset. We compare the predictive performance of the new approach to random forests trained only on the real data. A Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) framework with 100 iterations was employed to investigate significance and stability of the results. Since a first study yielded inconclusive results, a second study with improved methodology (i.e., systematic information extraction and different prediction outcome) was conducted. In Study 1, some pretrained random forests descriptively outperformed the standard random forest. However, this improvement was not significant (t(99) = 0.89, p = 0.19). Contrary to expectations, in Study 2 the random forest trained only with the real data outperformed the pretrained random forests. We conclude with a discussion of challenges, such as the scarcity of informative publications, and recommendations for future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06162v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, yet their use raises copyright and misuse concerns, prompting research into machine unlearning. However, extending multi-concept unlearning to large-scale scenarios remains difficult due to three challenges: (i) conflicting weight updates that hinder unlearning or degrade generation; (ii) imprecise mechanisms that cause collateral damage to similar content; and (iii) reliance on additional data or modules, creating scalability bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality. It forgets up to $\times \mathbf{5}$ more concepts than the best baseline within acceptable quality limits, achieving state-of-the-art precision and efficiency for large-scale unlearning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parent-Guided Adaptive Reliability (PGAR) is a lightweight behavioural meta-learning framework that adds a supervisory "parent" layer on top of a standard learner to improve stability, calibration, and recovery under disturbances. PGAR computes three reflex-level signals (incident detection, overconfidence correction, and recovery memory) and fuses them into a bounded reliability index in [0,1]. This index continuously modulates the learner's effective learning rate, reducing update magnitude during instability and restoring it as reliability improves. We provide a Lyapunov-based proof sketch establishing bounded adaptation of the reliability dynamics under mild assumptions (smooth loss, descent direction, and bounded reflex outputs). Empirical evaluations on representative learning tasks show improved calibration, reduced loss variance, and faster recovery compared to standard optimizers, while retaining computational simplicity. PGAR functions as a plug-in reliability layer for existing optimization and learning pipelines, supporting interpretable reliability traces in safety-relevant settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06180v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Preference based alignment objectives implicitly assume that all human preferences are expressed with equal strength. In practice, however, preference strength varies across individuals and contexts -- a phenomenon established in behavioral economics and discrete choice theory. This mismatch limits the ability of existing objectives to faithfully capture heterogeneous human judgments. Inspired by this literature, we introduce Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO), a generalization of Direct Preference Optimization that models variation in preference strength. MixDPO enables alignment objectives to capture heterogeneity in how strongly preferences are expressed across training examples. We evaluate MixDPO on three preference datasets using two open-weight language models. Across datasets, MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) while preserving subgroup level preferences, with the largest gains appearing in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity. MixDPO makes preference heterogeneity explicit through learned strength distributions. We release our code for reproducibility.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06183v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a community challenge designed to facilitate direct comparisons between data-driven methods for compression, forecasting, and sensing of complex aerospace flows. The challenge is organized into three tracks that target these complementary capabilities: compression (compact representations for large datasets), forecasting (predicting future flow states from a finite history), and sensing (inferring unmeasured flow states from limited measurements). Across these tracks, multiple challenges span diverse flow datasets and use cases, each emphasizing different model requirements. The challenge is open to anyone, and we invite broad participation to build a comprehensive and balanced picture of what works and where current methods fall short. To support fair comparisons, we provide standardized success metrics, evaluation tools, and baseline implementations, with one classical and one machine-learning baseline per challenge. Final assessments use blind tests on withheld data. We explicitly encourage negative results and careful analyses of limitations. Outcomes will be disseminated through an AIAA Journal Virtual Collection and invited presentations at AIAA conferences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06186v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Supporting Go/No-Go decisions prior to launch requires assessing real-time telemetry data against redline limits established during the design qualification phase. Family data from ground testing or previous flights is commonly used to detect initiating failure modes and their timing; however, this approach relies heavily on engineering judgment and is more error-prone for new launch vehicles. To address these limitations, we utilize Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for supervised classification of time-series anomalies. Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors. In this work, we propose a novel statistical detector based on the Mahalanobis distance and forward-backward detection fractions to adjust the supervised training labels. We demonstrate our method on digital twin simulations of a ground-stage propulsion system with 20.8 minutes of operation per trial and O(10^8) training timesteps. The statistical data relabeling improved precision and recall of the LSTM classifier by 7% and 22% respectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06191v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid growth of IoT devices and latency-sensitive applications, the demand for both real-time and energy-efficient computing has surged, placing significant pressure on traditional cloud computing architectures. Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06193v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative potential for healthcare, yet practical deployment is hindered by the absence of frameworks that assess real-world clinical utility. Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol. MLB thus provides a rigorous framework to guide the development of clinically viable LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06195v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Battery capacity degradation prediction has long been a central topic in battery health analytics, and most studies focus on state of health (SoH) estimation and end of life (EoL) prediction. This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or unsupported content, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.   We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.   Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06214v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) represents a central challenge within the biology field, and accurately predicting the consequences of mutations in this context is crucial for drug design and protein engineering. Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wind turbines play a critical role in the shift toward sustainable energy generation. Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method achieves an F1 Score of 98.95\%, evaluated on real-world datasets, and demonstrates superior performance in both detection accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a fragmented and inefficient ecosystem, a state of ``model lock-in'' where seamlessly integrating novel models remains a significant bottleneck. Current routing frameworks require exhaustive, costly retraining, hindering scalability and adaptability. We introduce ZeroRouter, a new paradigm for LLM routing that breaks this lock-in. Our approach is founded on a universal latent space, a model-agnostic representation of query difficulty that fundamentally decouples the characterization of a query from the profiling of a model. This allows for zero-shot onboarding of new models without full-scale retraining. ZeroRouter features a context-aware predictor that maps queries to this universal space and a dual-mode optimizer that balances accuracy, cost, and latency. Our framework consistently outperforms all baselines, delivering higher accuracy at lower cost and latency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clustering temporal and dynamically changing multivariate time series from real-world fields, called temporal clustering for short, has been a major challenge due to inherent complexities. Although several deep temporal clustering algorithms have demonstrated a strong advantage over traditional methods in terms of model learning and clustering results, the accuracy of the few algorithms are not satisfactory. None of the existing algorithms can continuously learn new tasks and deal with the dynamic data effectively and efficiently in the sequential tasks learning. To bridge the gap and tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm \textbf{L}ifelong \textbf{D}eep \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}lustering (\textbf{LDTC}), which effectively integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into an end-to-end deep unsupervised learning framework. Using a specifically designed autoencoder and jointly optimizing for both the latent representation and clustering objective, the LDTC can achieve high-quality clustering results. Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy. Experiments on seven real-world multivariate time series datasets show that the LDTC is a promising method for dealing with temporal clustering issues effectively and efficiently.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose inherent risks of generating toxic content, restricting their safe deployment. While traditional methods (e.g., alignment) adjust output preferences, they fail to eliminate underlying toxic regions in parameters, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Prior mechanistic studies characterize toxic regions as "toxic vectors" or "layer-wise subspaces", yet our analysis identifies critical limitations: i) Removed toxic vectors can be reconstructed via linear combinations of non-toxic vectors, demanding targeting of entire toxic subspace; ii) Contrastive objective over limited samples inject noise into layer-wise subspaces, hindering stable extraction. These highlight the challenge of identifying robust toxic subspace and removing them. Therefore, we propose GLOSS (GLobal tOxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight method that mitigates toxicity by identifying and eliminating this global subspace from FFN parameters. Experiments on LLMs (e.g., Qwen3) show GLOSS achieves SOTA detoxification while preserving general capabilities without requiring large-scale retraining. WARNING: This paper contains context which is toxic in nature.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06227v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Battery management systems increasingly require accurate battery health prognostics under strict on-device constraints. This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device. These results support a practical smaller wins observation that a small model can match or exceed a large teacher for edge-based prognostics with proper supervision and selection. Beyond batteries, the DLNet framework can extend to other industrial analytics tasks with strict hardware constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: An artificial neural network (ANN) is a numerical method used to solve complex classification problems. Due to its high classification power, the ANN method often outperforms other classification methods in terms of accuracy. However, an ANN model lacks interpretability compared to methods that use the symbolic paradigm. Our idea is to derive a symbolic representation from a simple ANN model trained on minterm values of input objects. Based on ReLU nodes, the ANN model is partitioned into cells. We convert the ANN model into a cell-based, three-dimensional bit tensor. The theory of Formal Concept Analysis applied to the tensor yields concepts that are represented as logic trees, expressing interpretable attribute interactions. Their evaluations preserve the classification power of the initial ANN model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06288v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production systems is increasingly difficult due to dynamic workloads, stringent latency/throughput targets, and a rapidly expanding configuration space. This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average. Enabling the rapid exploration of vast design spaces - from cluster topology down to engine specific flags.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06320v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inferring high-dimensional physical states from sparse, ad-hoc sensor arrays is a fundamental challenge across AI for Science, as they are complicated by irregular geometries and the profound Sim-to-Real gap in physical modeling. Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing. Remarkably, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06336v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many real-world prediction problems lack labels observable at prediction time, creating a temporal gap between prediction and outcome that yields supervision only after events resolve. To address this setting, we extend reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to temporally resolved real-world prediction, and use it to train language models to make probabilistic forecasts under causally masked information with retrospective evaluation using proper scoring rules. Supervision is derived solely from post-resolution outcomes, preserving delayed-reward semantics. On real-world forecasting benchmarks, Qwen3-32B trained using Foresight Learning improves Brier score by 27% and halves calibration error relative to its pretrained baseline, and outperforms Qwen3-235B on both constructed future-event prediction tasks and the Metaculus benchmark despite a 7x parameter disadvantage.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06341v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enterprise LLM applications require consistently high quality and reliable performance across diverse scenarios, demanding robustness to minor variations. Existing research shows that even small prompt changes can lead to substantial differences in output, but has mainly focused on a narrow set of perturbations with small academic datasets, limiting their relevance to real-world applications. To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates robustness across multiple perturbation types, including general text edits (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), formatting changes (e.g., JSON, YAML), multilingual and cross-lingual inputs, and positional variations in instructions. Evaluating 11 models ranging from 4B to 120B+ parameters, we find that minor perturbations reduce performance by up to 40 percentage points on key enterprise metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that the relationship between model size and robustness is more nuanced than conventional assumptions suggest: an 8B parameter model (Ministral 3 8B) outperforms most larger models, while another 8B model (Llama 3.1 8B) performs worst overall.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06348v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, real-world FL deployments face critical challenges such as data imbalances, including label noise and non-IID distributions. RHFL+, a state-of-the-art method, was proposed to address these challenges in settings with heterogeneous client models. This work investigates the robustness of RHFL+ under class imbalances through three key contributions: (1) reproduction of RHFL+ along with all benchmark algorithms under a unified evaluation framework; (2) extension of RHFL+ to real-world medical imaging datasets, including CBIS-DDSM, BreastMNIST and BHI; (3) a novel implementation using NVFlare, NVIDIA's production-level federated learning framework, enabling a modular, scalable and deployment-ready codebase. To validate effectiveness, extensive ablation studies, algorithmic comparisons under various noise conditions and scalability experiments across increasing numbers of clients are conducted.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06351v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The anticlustering problem is to partition a set of objects into K equal-sized anticlusters such that the sum of distances within anticlusters is maximized. The anticlustering problem is NP-hard. We focus on anticlustering in Euclidean spaces, where the input data is tabular and each object is represented as a D-dimensional feature vector. Distances are measured as squared Euclidean distances between the respective vectors. Applications of Euclidean anticlustering include social studies, particularly in psychology, K-fold cross-validation in which each fold should be a good representative of the entire dataset, the creation of mini-batches for gradient descent in neural network training, and balanced K-cut partitioning. In particular, machine-learning applications involve million-scale datasets and very large values of K, making scalable anticlustering algorithms essential. Existing algorithms are either exact methods that can solve only small instances or heuristic methods, among which the most scalable is the exchange-based heuristic fast_anticlustering. We propose a new algorithm, the Assignment-Based Anticlustering algorithm (ABA), which scales to very large instances. A computational study shows that ABA outperforms fast_anticlustering in both solution quality and running time. Moreover, ABA scales to instances with millions of objects and hundreds of thousands of anticlusters within short running times, beyond what fast_anticlustering can handle. As a balanced K-cut partitioning method for tabular data, ABA is superior to the well-known METIS method in both solution quality and running time. The code of the ABA algorithm is available on GitHub.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-experts variants of parameter-efficient fine-tuning enable per-token specialization, but they introduce additional trainable routers and expert parameters, increasing memory usage and training cost. This undermines the core goal of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We propose Monkey Jump, a method that brings mixture-of-experts-style specialization to parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing extra trainable parameters for experts or routers. Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects. Across multi-task experiments covering 14 text, 14 image, and 19 video benchmarks, Monkey Jump achieves competitive performance with mixture-of-experts-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while using 7 to 29 times fewer trainable parameters, up to 48 percent lower memory consumption, and 1.5 to 2 times faster training. Monkey Jump is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study explores the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical pooling and multiple convolution layers for cancer classification based on RNA-seq data. We combine gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with a precomputed STRING protein-protein interaction network to classify tissue origin and distinguish between normal and tumor samples. The model employs Chebyshev graph convolutions (K=2) and weighted pooling layers, aggregating gene clusters into 'supernodes' across multiple coarsening levels. This approach enables dimensionality reduction while preserving meaningful interactions. Saliency methods were applied to interpret the model by identifying key genes and biological processes relevant to cancer. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of convolution and pooling layers did not enhance classification performance. The highest F1-macro score (0.978) was achieved with a single pooling layer. However, adding more layers resulted in over-smoothing and performance degradation. However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures. Overall, while deeper GNN architectures did not improve performance, the hierarchical pooling structure provided valuable insights into tumor biology, making GNNs a promising tool for cancer biomarker discovery and interpretation

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06404v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driven by the growth of Web-scale decentralized services, Federated Clustering (FC) aims to extract knowledge from heterogeneous clients in an unsupervised manner while preserving the clients' privacy, which has emerged as a significant challenge due to the lack of label guidance and the Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of clients. In real scenarios such as personalized recommendation and cross-device user profiling, the global cluster may be fragmented and distributed among different clients, and the clusters may exist at different granularities or even nested. Although Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is considered promising for exploring such distributions, the sophisticated recursive clustering process makes it more computationally expensive and vulnerable to privacy exposure, thus relatively unexplored under the federated learning scenario. This paper introduces an efficient one-shot hierarchical FC framework that performs client-end distribution exploration and server-end distribution aggregation through one-way prototype-level communication from clients to the server. A fine partition mechanism is developed to generate successive clusterlets to describe the complex landscape of the clients' clusters. Then, a multi-granular learning mechanism on the server is proposed to fuse the clusterlets, even when they have inconsistent granularities generated from different clients. It turns out that the complex cluster distributions across clients can be efficiently explored, and extensive experiments comparing state-of-the-art methods on ten public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06428v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) achieve significant speed by generating multiple tokens in parallel. However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose Decoupled Self-Correction (DSC), a novel two-stage methodology. DSC first fully optimizes the DLM's generative ability before freezing the model and training a specialized correction head. This decoupling preserves the model's peak SFT performance and ensures the generated errors used for correction head training are of higher quality. Additionally, we introduce Future-Context Augmentation (FCA) to maximize the correction head's accuracy. FCA generalizes the error training distribution by augmenting samples with ground-truth tokens, effectively training the head to utilize a richer, future-looking context. This mechanism is used for reliably detecting the subtle errors of the high-fidelity base model. Our DSC framework enables the model, at inference time, to jointly generate and revise tokens, thereby correcting errors introduced by multi-token generation and mitigating error accumulation across steps. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces the quality degradation associated with larger generation steps, allowing DLMs to achieve both high generation speed and strong output fidelity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06429v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale source datasets are reshaping the traditional training paradigm for time series classification. However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets and 30 additional time series datasets demonstrate that UniShape achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, with interpretability and ablation analyses further validating its effectiveness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06436v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driven by the right to be forgotten (RTBF), machine unlearning has become an essential requirement for privacy-preserving machine learning. However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

Our method dynamically learns the optimal activation function independently of the input, thereby enhancing both predictive accuracy and architectural flexibility. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our model consistently selects the most suitable activation function, underscoring its effectiveness. These results connect theoretical advances with practical utility, paving the way for more adaptive and modular neural architectures in complex learning scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06444v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06463v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing a unified neural network to efficiently and inherently process sequential data with arbitrary lengths is a central and challenging problem in sequence modeling. The design choices in Transformer, including quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation, have limited their ability to scale to long sequences. In this work, we propose Gecko, a neural architecture that inherits the design of Mega and Megalodon (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability to capture long range dependencies, including timestep decay normalization, sliding chunk attention mechanism, and adaptive working memory. In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to $4\times$ longer than its attention window.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06472v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning solution operators for differential equations with neural networks has shown great potential in scientific computing, but ensuring their stability under input perturbations remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a robust self-supervised neural operator framework that enhances stability through adversarial training while preserving accuracy. We formulate operator learning as a min-max optimization problem, where the model is trained against worst-case input perturbations to achieve consistent performance under both normal and adversarial conditions. We demonstrate that our method not only achieves good performance on standard inputs, but also maintains high fidelity under adversarial perturbed inputs. The results highlight the importance of stability-aware training in operator learning and provide a foundation for developing reliable neural PDE solvers in real-world applications, where input noise and uncertainties are inevitable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient descent on log-sum-exp (LSE) objectives performs implicit expectation--maximization (EM): the gradient with respect to each component output equals its responsibility. The same theory predicts collapse without volume control analogous to the log-determinant in Gaussian mixture models. We instantiate the theory in a single-layer encoder with an LSE objective and InfoMax regularization for volume control. Experiments confirm the theory's predictions. The gradient--responsibility identity holds exactly; LSE alone collapses; variance prevents dead components; decorrelation prevents redundancy. The model exhibits EM-like optimization dynamics in which lower loss does not correspond to better features and adaptive optimizers offer no advantage. The resulting decoder-free model learns interpretable mixture components, confirming that implicit EM theory can prescribe architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning has substantially improved the performance of LLM agents on tasks with verifiable outcomes, but it still struggles on open-ended agent tasks with vast solution spaces (e.g., complex travel planning). Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ArenaRL substantially outperforms standard RL baselines, enabling LLM agents to generate more robust solutions for complex real-world tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06505v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a common framework for optimizing black-box functions, yet most existing methods assume static query costs and rely on myopic acquisition strategies. We introduce LookaHES, a nonmyopic BO framework designed for dynamic, history-dependent cost environments, where evaluation costs vary with prior actions, such as travel distance in spatial tasks or edit distance in sequence design. LookaHES combines a multi-step variant of $H$-Entropy Search with pathwise sampling and neural policy optimization, enabling long-horizon planning beyond twenty steps without the exponential complexity of existing nonmyopic methods. The key innovation is the integration of neural policies, including large language models, to effectively navigate structured, combinatorial action spaces such as protein sequences. These policies amortize lookahead planning and can be integrated with domain-specific constraints during rollout. Empirically, LookaHES outperforms strong myopic and nonmyopic baselines across nine synthetic benchmarks from two to eight dimensions and two real-world tasks: geospatial optimization using NASA night-light imagery and protein sequence design with constrained token-level edits. In short, LookaHES provides a general, scalable, and cost-aware solution for robust long-horizon optimization in complex decision spaces, which makes it a useful tool for researchers in machine learning, statistics, and applied domains. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/sangttruong/nonmyopia.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary industrial Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods require sensing capabilities that operate in occluded, hazardous, or access restricted environments. Yet, the current visual inspection based on optical cameras offers limited quality of service to that respect. In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection. Specifically, we establish correlation relationships between RF wavefronts and target industrial assets, hence yielding a dataset which links wavefronts to their corresponding images in a structured manner. Subsequently, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) derives visual representations closely matching the database entries. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves an SSIM 99.5% matching score in visual outputs, paving the way for next-generation quality control workflows in industry.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate forecasting of the grid carbon intensity factor (CIF) is critical for enabling demand-side management and reducing emissions in modern electricity systems. Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules. Designed with built-in interpretability, the proposed model also enables better understanding of its predictive behavior, as shown in a case study where it adaptively shifts attention to relevant variables and time intervals during a disruptive event.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful method in various applications. However, their application to Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) -- a typical scenario in energy systems -- remains largely unexplored. Considering the nonlinear and fluctuating characteristics of the load data, effectively utilizing the powerful modeling capabilities of diffusion models to enhance STELF accuracy remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network. To validate the effectiveness of the MFRD model, we conducted experiments on two data platforms: Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE). The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the compared models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06562v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, utilizing simultaneous denoising to enable global planning and iterative refinement. While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\times$. This scalability is achieved without compromising accuracy and speed, and in fact reducing latency by 4.12%-23.26%.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06572v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely used for weakly supervised generative learning with multiple modalities. Predominant methods aggregate unimodal inference distributions using either a product of experts (PoE), a mixture of experts (MoE), or their combinations to approximate the joint posterior. In this work, we revisit multimodal inference through the lens of probabilistic opinion pooling, an optimization-based approach. We start from H\"older pooling with $\alpha=0.5$, which corresponds to the unique symmetric member of the $\alpha\text{-divergence}$ family, and derive a moment-matching approximation, termed Hellinger. We then leverage such an approximation to propose HELVAE, a multimodal VAE that avoids sub-sampling, yielding an efficient yet effective model that: (i) learns more expressive latent representations as additional modalities are observed; and (ii) empirically achieves better trade-offs between generative coherence and quality, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06584v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning robust and generalisable abstractions from high-dimensional input data is a central challenge in machine learning and its applications to high-energy physics (HEP). Solutions of lower functional complexity are known to produce abstractions that generalise more effectively and are more robust to input perturbations. In complex hypothesis spaces, inductive biases make such solutions learnable by shaping the loss geometry during optimisation. In a HEP classification task, we show that a soft symmetry respecting inductive bias creates approximate degeneracies in the loss, which we identify as pseudo-Goldstone modes. We quantify functional complexity using metrics derived from first principles Hessian analysis and via compressibility. Our results demonstrate that solutions of lower complexity give rise to abstractions that are more generalisable, robust, and efficiently distillable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06597v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A central problem in machine learning theory is to characterize how learning dynamics select particular solutions among the many compatible with the training objective, a phenomenon, called implicit bias, which remains only partially characterized. In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work. Finally, we test the implicit bias inverse-design procedure in notable cases, including biases toward sparsity in linear features or in spectral properties of the model parameters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We demonstrate CEDAR, an application for automating data science (DS) tasks with an agentic setup. Solving DS problems with LLMs is an underexplored area that has immense market value. The challenges are manifold: task complexities, data sizes, computational limitations, and context restrictions. We show that these can be alleviated via effective context engineering. We first impose structure into the initial prompt with DS-specific input fields, that serve as instructions for the agentic system. The solution is then materialized as an enumerated sequence of interleaved plan and code blocks generated by separate LLM agents, providing a readable structure to the context at any step of the workflow. Function calls for generating these intermediate texts, and for corresponding Python code, ensure that data stays local, and only aggregate statistics and associated instructions are injected into LLM prompts. Fault tolerance and context management are introduced via iterative code generation and smart history rendering. The viability of our agentic data scientist is demonstrated using canonical Kaggle challenges.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06633v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-ended tasks, such as coding problems that are common in computer science education, provide detailed insights into student knowledge. However, training large language models (LLMs) to simulate and predict possible student errors in their responses to these problems can be challenging: they often suffer from mode collapse and fail to fully capture the diversity in syntax, style, and solution approach in student responses. In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity. On two real-world datasets, we perform two levels of evaluation and show that: At the per-student-problem pair level, our method outperforms baselines on code and error prediction; at the per-problem level, our method outperforms baselines on error coverage and simulated code diversity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06641v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Membership inference attack (MIA) poses a significant privacy threat in federated learning (FL) as it allows adversaries to determine whether a client's private dataset contains a specific data sample. While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06649v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Research in machine learning has questioned whether increases in training token counts reliably produce proportional performance gains in large language models. Building on prior work introducing an energy-aware parameter efficiency metric, this study empirically examines the effects of increasing training token counts under fixed hardware and training conditions. The significance of this work lies in the explicit integration of power consumption and execution duration, as reflected by the power sampling frequency, into token-scale analysis. This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M). While conventional performance metrics exhibited inconsistent or diminishing returns across token scales, the inclusion of power consumption and execution duration revealed a strictly monotonic decline in training efficiency as token count increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a strong effect of token count on parameter efficiency, with all pairwise comparisons remaining significant following Bonferroni correction. These findings indicate that increases in training token counts may be energetically inefficient even when marginal performance improvements are observed, underscoring the importance of efficiency-aware evaluation in large language model training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06664v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time traffic prediction is critical for managing transportation systems during hurricane evacuations. Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance. This research provides a generalized and interpretable model for real-time evacuation traffic forecasting, with significant implications for evacuation traffic management.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning typically rely on massive scale, yet the question remains: can strong reasoning capabilities be induced in small language models ($\leq1.5\text{B}$) under extreme constraints? We investigate this by training models on a single A40 GPU (48GB) for under 24 hours using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We find that the success of this ``micro-budget" regime depends critically on the interplay between adapter capacity and model initialization. While low-rank adapters ($r=8$) consistently fail to capture the complex optimization dynamics of reasoning, high-rank adapters ($r=256$) unlock significant plasticity in standard instruction-tuned models. Our best result achieved an impressive 40.0\% Pass@1 on AIME 24 (an 11.1\% absolute improvement over baseline) and pushed Pass@16 to 70.0\%, demonstrating robust exploration capabilities. However, this plasticity is not universal: while instruction-tuned models utilized the budget to elongate their chain-of-thought and maximize reward, heavily math-aligned models suffered performance collapse, suggesting that noisy, low-budget RL updates can act as destructive interference for models already residing near a task-specific optimum.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06701v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Complex AI systems make better predictions but often lack transparency, limiting trustworthiness, interpretability, and safe deployment. Common post hoc AI explainers, such as LIME, SHAP, HSIC, and SAGE, are model agnostic but are too restricted in one significant regard: they tend to misrank correlated features and require costly perturbations, which do not scale to high dimensional data. We introduce ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a theoretically grounded, simple, and reliable metric for explaining the contribution of input features to model outputs, which remains stable and consistent under noise and sampling variations. We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient. To this end, we further extend ExCIR with an information theoretic foundation that unifies the correlation ratio with Canonical Correlation Analysis under mutual information bounds, enabling multi output and class conditioned explainability at scale.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06704v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models show strong promise for new biomedical prediction tasks, but concerns about trustworthiness have hindered their clinical adoption. In particular, it is often unclear whether a model relies on true clinical cues or on spurious hierarchical correlations in the data. This paper introduces a simple yet broadly applicable trustworthiness test grounded in stochastic proof-by-contradiction. Instead of just showing high test performance, our approach trains and tests on spurious labels carefully permuted based on a potential outcomes framework. A truly trustworthy model should fail under such label permutation; comparable accuracy across real and permuted labels indicates overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage. Our approach quantifies this behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values, which are well understood by domain experts across medical and life sciences. We evaluate our approach on multiple new bacterial diagnostics to separate tasks and models learning genuine causal relationships from those driven by dataset artifacts or statistical coincidences. Our work establishes a foundation to build rigor and trust between ML and life-science research communities, moving ML models one step closer to clinical adoption.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06729v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early identification of student success is crucial for enabling timely interventions, reducing dropout rates, and promoting on time graduation. In educational settings, AI powered systems have become essential for predicting student performance due to their advanced analytical capabilities. However, effectively leveraging diverse student data to uncover latent and complex patterns remains a key challenge. While prior studies have explored this area, the potential of dynamic data features and multi category entities has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates heterogeneous graph deep learning models to enhance early and continuous student performance prediction, using traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. Our approach employs a graph metapath structure and incorporates dynamic assessment features, which progressively influence the student success prediction task. Experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset demonstrate promising results, achieving a 68.6% validation F1 score with only 7% of the semester completed, and reaching up to 89.5% near the semester's end. Our approach outperforms top machine learning models by 4.7% in validation F1 score during the critical early 7% of the semester, underscoring the value of dynamic features and heterogeneous graph representations in student success prediction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06730v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Rashomon effect -- the existence of multiple, distinct models that achieve nearly equivalent predictive performance -- has emerged as a fundamental phenomenon in modern machine learning and statistics. In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners. Beyond characterizing causes, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by the Rashomon effect, including implications for inference, interpretability, fairness, and decision-making under uncertainty.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06742v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models for radiology interpretation increasingly rely on multi-institutional data, yet privacy regulations and distribution shift across hospitals limit central data pooling. Federated learning (FL) allows hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing raw images, but current FL algorithms typically assume a static data distribution. In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework. EWC constrains updates along parameters deemed important for previous tasks, while a memory of latent prototypes preserves class structure without storing raw images. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) at each client adds calibrated Gaussian noise to clipped gradients, providing formal privacy guarantees for individual radiographs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06770v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wide-spread adoption of unmanned vehicle technologies requires the ability to predict the motion of the combined vehicle operation from observations. While the general prediction of such motion for an arbitrary control mechanism is difficult, for a particular choice of control, the dynamics reduces to the Lie-Poisson equations [33,34]. Our goal is to learn the phase-space dynamics and predict the motion solely from observations, without any knowledge of the control Hamiltonian or the nature of interaction between vehicles. To achieve that goal, we propose the Control Optimal Lie-Poisson Neural Networks (CO-LPNets) for learning and predicting the dynamics of the system from data. Our methods learn the mapping of the phase space through the composition of Poisson maps, which are obtained as flows from Hamiltonians that could be integrated explicitly. CO-LPNets preserve the Poisson bracket and thus preserve Casimirs to machine precision. We discuss the completeness of the derived neural networks and their efficiency in approximating the dynamics. To illustrate the power of the method, we apply these techniques to systems of $N=3$ particles evolving on ${\rm SO}(3)$ group, which describe coupled rigid bodies rotating about their center of mass, and ${\rm SE}(3)$ group, applicable to the movement of unmanned air and water vehicles. Numerical results demonstrate that CO-LPNets learn the dynamics in phase space from data points and reproduce trajectories, with good accuracy, over hundreds of time steps. The method uses a limited number of points ($\sim200$/dimension) and parameters ($\sim 1000$ in our case), demonstrating potential for practical applications and edge deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06788v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the gold standard for quantifying mental workload; however, due to its complexity and non-portability, it can be constraining. ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations. Overall, this work is an initiation for building low-cost, explainable, and real-time cognitive monitoring systems for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on ageing and clinical populations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Financial fraud is always a major problem in the field of finance, as it can cause significant consequences. As a result, many approaches have been designed to detect it, and lately Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as a competent candidate. However, when trained with a large amount of data, they are slow and computationally demanding. In addition, GNNs may need a deep architecture to detect complex fraud patterns, but doing so may make them suffer from problems such as over-fitting or over-smoothing. Over-fitting leads to reduced generalisation of the model on unseen data, while over-smoothing causes all nodes' features to converge to a fixed point due to excessive aggregation of information from neighbouring nodes. In this research, I propose an approach called One-Side Edge Sampling (OES) that can potentially reduce training duration as well as the effects of over-smoothing and over-fitting. The approach leverages predictive confidence in an edge classification task to sample edges from the input graph during a certain number of epochs. To explain why OES can alleviate over-smoothing, I perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. In addition, to validate the effect of OES, I conduct experiments using different GNNs on two datasets. The results show that OES can empirically outperform backbone models in both shallow and deep architectures while also reducing training time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06810v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) metric extends dynamic optimal transport (OT) by coupling displacement with change of mass, providing a principled geometry for modeling unbalanced snapshot dynamics. Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy. Overall, WFR-FM establishes a unified and efficient paradigm for learning dynamical systems from unbalanced snapshots, where not only states but also mass evolve over time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The field of algorithms with predictions aims to improve algorithm performance by integrating machine learning predictions into algorithm design. A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy. We further generalize the DRCR framework to a multiple-prediction setting and show that monotonicity and concavity are preserved in this setting. Finally, we apply our results to the ski rental problem, a benchmark problem in online optimization, to identify the conditions on prediction accuracies required for the optimal DRCR to attain a target value. Moreover, we provide a method for computing the critical accuracy, defined as the minimum accuracy required for the optimal DRCR to strictly improve upon the performance attainable without any accuracy guarantee.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically requires high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs (e.g., A100), and their high cost has become a major barrier to large-model training. In contrast, affordable hardware is low-cost but constrained by memory capacity and bandwidth, making it unsuitable for direct LLM training. To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering. Each submodel is trained independently and in parallel on its assigned data subset using low-cost devices, without any inter-device communication. Subsequently, all experts are integrated into a complete MoE model and fine-tuned globally for a short period on high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs. Experiments show that our method matches or even surpasses full-parameter training in performance across multiple downstream tasks, loss function, and perplexity (PPL), while reducing training cost by 47.6 percent to 69.5 percent on Qwen1.5-MoE-2.7B and Llama-MoE-3.5B across different datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06867v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06870v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet their effectiveness on multimodal sentiment analysis remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality training data, which limits accurate multimodal understanding and generalization. To alleviate this bottleneck, we leverage diffusion models to perform semantics-preserving augmentation on the video and audio modalities, expanding the multimodal training distribution. However, increasing data quantity alone is insufficient, as diffusion-generated samples exhibit substantial quality variation and noisy augmentations may degrade performance. We therefore propose DaQ-MSA (Denoising and Qualifying Diffusion Augmentations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis), which introduces a quality scoring module to evaluate the reliability of augmented samples and assign adaptive training weights. By down-weighting low-quality samples and emphasizing high-fidelity ones, DaQ-MSA enables more stable learning. By integrating the generative capability of diffusion models with the semantic understanding of MLLMs, our approach provides a robust and generalizable automated augmentation strategy for training MLLMs without any human annotation or additional supervision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the multinomial logit (MNL) contextual bandit problem for sequential assortment selection. Although most existing research assumes utility functions to be linear in item features, this linearity assumption restricts the modeling of intricate interactions between items and user preferences. A recent work (Zhang & Luo, 2024) has investigated general utility function classes, yet its method faces fundamental trade-offs between computational tractability and statistical efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first computationally tractable algorithm for MNL contextual bandits with non-linear utilities that provably attains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing robust performance not only in realizable settings but also in scenarios with model misspecification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06916v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient discovery of new materials demands strategies to reduce the number of costly first-principles calculations required to train predictive machine learning models. We develop and validate an active learning framework that iteratively selects informative training structures for machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) from large, heterogeneous materials databases, specifically the Materials Project and OQMD. Our framework integrates compositional and property-based descriptors with a neural network ensemble model, enabling real-time uncertainty quantification via Query-by-Committee. We systematically compare four selection strategies: random sampling (baseline), uncertainty-based sampling, diversity-based sampling (k-means clustering with farthest-point refinement), and a hybrid approach balancing both objectives. Experiments across four representative material systems (elemental carbon, silicon, iron, and a titanium-oxide compound) with 5 random seeds per configuration demonstrate that diversity sampling consistently achieves competitive or superior performance, with particularly strong advantages on complex systems like titanium-oxide (10.9% improvement, p=0.008). Our results show that intelligent data selection strategies can achieve target accuracy with 5-13% fewer labeled samples compared to random baselines. The entire pipeline executes on Google Colab in under 4 hours per system using less than 8 GB of RAM, thereby democratizing MLIP development for researchers globally with limited computational resources. Our open-source code and detailed experimental configurations are available on GitHub. This multi-system evaluation establishes practical guidelines for data-efficient MLIP training and highlights promising future directions including integration with symmetry-aware neural network architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06938v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning, a process enabling pre-trained models to remove the influence of specific training samples, has attracted significant attention in recent years. Although extensive research has focused on developing efficient machine unlearning strategies, we argue that these methods mainly aim at removing samples rather than removing samples' influence on the model, thus overlooking the fundamental definition of machine unlearning. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing unlearning schemes when the training dataset includes many samples similar to those targeted for unlearning. Specifically, we evaluate: Do existing unlearning methods truly adhere to the original definition of machine unlearning and effectively eliminate all influence of target samples when similar samples are present in the training dataset? Our extensive experiments, conducted on four carefully constructed datasets with thorough analysis, reveal a notable gap between the expected and actual performance of most existing unlearning methods for image and language models, even for the retraining-from-scratch baseline. Additionally, we also explore potential solutions to enhance current unlearning approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06941v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust hydrological simulation is key for sustainable development, water management strategies, and climate change adaptation. In recent years, deep learning methods have been demonstrated to outperform mechanistic models at the task of hydrological discharge simulation. Adoption of these methods has been catalysed by the proliferation of large sample hydrology datasets, consisting of the observed discharge and meteorological drivers, along with geological and topographical catchment descriptors. Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited. The lack of adoption of deep learning methodologies is primarily due to sparsity or lack of the spatiotemporal observational data required to enable downstream model training. We therefore investigate the application of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for hydrological discharge simulation in the transboundary Limpopo River basin, emphasising application to data scarce regions. We conduct a number of computational experiments primarily focused on assessing the impact of varying the LSTM model input data on performance. Results confirm that data constraints remain the largest obstacle to deep learning applications across African river basins. We further outline the impact of human influence on data-driven modelling which is a commonly overlooked aspect of data-driven large-sample hydrology approaches and investigate solutions for model adaptation under smaller datasets. Additionally, we include recommendations for future efforts towards seasonal hydrological discharge prediction and direct comparison or inclusion of SWAT model outputs, as well as architectural improvements.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06959v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource- constrained devices. However, standard integer quantization (e.g., INT4) fundamentally degrades per- formance by imposing a uniform grid on the heavy-tailed distribution of weight parameters, particularly in smaller-scale models (e.g., <2B parameters). We introduce HAS-VQ (Hessian-Adaptive Sparse Vec- tor Quantization), a compression framework that strictly decouples high-sensitivity outliers from the bulk weight distribution using second-order sensitivity analysis. HAS-VQ employs a Hessian-Masked Decoupling strategy to isolate sensitive parameters, followed by robust Vector Quantization (VQ) of the remaining dense body. Crucially, we introduce a residual sparse feedback mechanism that corrects quan- tization errors in the most sensitive dimensions, ensuring exact reconstruction of outliers. We evaluate HAS-VQ on SmolLM2-1.7B, demonstrating two distinct regimes of superiority: (1) Pareto Dominance over Integer Baselines: At 4.23 effective bits-per-parameter (BPP), we achieve a perplexity of 14.23, significantly outperforming the standard INT4 baseline (20.03 PPL at 4.71 BPP). (2) High-Fidelity Compression: Relative to the FP16 baseline, HAS-VQ achieves a 2.3x reduction in model size (7.03 BPP) while maintaining statistically indistinguishable perplexity (10.12 vs. 10.04), effectively offering a lossless compression alternative for bandwidth-constrained environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06967v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Newton method has been widely adopted to achieve certified unlearning. A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed). However,the problem of certified unlearning under non-i.i.d. deletions remains largely unexplored. In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness under distribution shift, we also conduct extensive experiments across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a comprehensive assessment of our approach.

We show that DSGD converges to a stationary distribution, with its bias, to first order, decomposable into two components: one due to decentralization (growing with the graph's spectral gap and clients' heterogeneity) and one due to stochasticity. Remarkably, the variance of local parameters is, at the first-order, inversely proportional to the number of clients, regardless of the network topology and even when clients' iterates are not averaged at the end. As a consequence of our analysis, we obtain non-asymptotic convergence bounds for clients' local iterates, confirming that DSGD has linear speed-up in the number of clients, and that the network topology only impacts higher-order terms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).   Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.   To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset. This work advances the field of molecular imaging by demonstrating the potential of AI-driven radiogenomics for precision oncology, supporting non-invasive, accurate, and interpretable prediction of clinically actionable molecular biomarkers in GBM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07058v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Benchmarks measure whether a model is correct. They do not measure whether a model is reliable. This distinction is largely academic for single-shot inference, but becomes critical for agentic AI systems, where a single rephrased prompt can trigger cascading failures in multi-step execution. Yet this form of instability is not captured by existing evaluations.   Hallucinations live in variance: they arise when semantically equivalent prompts activate inconsistent internal pathways, producing divergent outputs. Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement. SS is a diagnostic for variance-driven unreliability, not a method for improving correctness.   We show that a dense Qwen3-0.6B agrees with itself only 23.8% of the time; at 32% sparsity, agreement jumps to 55.9%. A phase diagram reveals the sweet spot where variance reduction outpaces bias accumulation, and regimes where stability collapses onto wrong answers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models in high-stakes settings remains a pressing challenge, as aligned behaviors are often brittle and easily undone by adversarial pressure or downstream finetuning. Prior work has shown that interventions applied during pretraining, such as rephrasing harmful content, can substantially improve the safety of the resulting models. In this paper, we study the fundamental question: "When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?" We keep the underlying data fixed and vary only the choice of a safety curriculum: the timing of these interventions, i.e., after 0%, 20%, or 60% of the pretraining token budget. We find that introducing interventions earlier generally yields more robust models with no increase in overrefusal rates, with the clearest benefits appearing after downstream, benign finetuning. We also see clear benefits in the steerability of models towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples. Overall, these results argue for incorporating safety signals early in pretraining, producing models that are more robust to downstream finetuning and jailbreaking, and more reliable under both standard and safety-aware inference procedures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07118v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adversarial robustness in RL is difficult because perturbations affect entire trajectories: strong attacks can break learning, while weak attacks yield little robustness, and the appropriate strength varies by state. We propose $\alpha$-reward-preserving attacks, which adapt the strength of the adversary so that an $\alpha$ fraction of the nominal-to-worst-case return gap remains achievable at each state. In deep RL, we use a gradient-based attack direction and learn a state-dependent magnitude $\eta\le \eta_{\mathcal B}$ selected via a critic $Q^{\pi}_\alpha((s,a),\eta)$ trained off-policy over diverse radii. This adaptive tuning calibrates attack strength and, with intermediate $\alpha$, improves robustness across radii while preserving nominal performance, outperforming fixed- and random-radius baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) are inherited arrhythmia syndromes associated with sudden cardiac death. Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence. These findings support potential utility for automated ECG screening pending validation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing new fluorophores for advanced imaging techniques requires exploring new chemical space. While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties. Of the 19 molecules, 14 were synthesized and 13 were experimentally confirmed. The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SyntheFluor-RL in the identification of synthetically accessible fluorophores for further development.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07155v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring knowledge from large language models to smaller student models; however, conventional supervised KD often suffers from a distribution mismatch between training and inference. While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) combines the strengths of learning from diverse datasets in offline RL with the adaptability to new tasks of meta-RL, promising safe and efficient knowledge acquisition by RL agents. However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties. FLORA integrates a return feedback mechanism to adaptively adjust feature components. Furthermore, to learn precise task representations, FLORA explicitly models the complex task distribution using a chain of invertible transformations. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that FLORA achieves rapid adaptation and meta-policy improvement compared to baselines across various environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Policy optimization for large language models often suffers from sparse reward signals in multi-step reasoning tasks. Critic-free methods like GRPO assign a single normalized outcome reward to all tokens, providing limited guidance for intermediate reasoning . While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer dense feedback, they risk premature collapse when used alone, as early low-reward tokens can drive policies toward truncated outputs. We introduce Process Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), which combines outcome reliability with process-level guidance in a critic-free framework. PRPO segments reasoning sequences based on semantic clues, normalizes PRM scores into token-level advantages, and aligns their distribution with outcome advantages through location-parameter shift. On MATH500, PRPO improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B accuracy from 61.2% to 64.4% over GRPO using only eight rollouts and no value network, demonstrating efficient fine-grained credit assignment within critic-free optimization.

While code and data availability requirements have become increasingly common, post-publication verification in journals is still limited and unformalized.

We propose a modification to ACM pre-publication verification badges that allows independent researchers to submit post-publication code replications to the journal, leading to visible verification badges included in the article metadata. Each article may earn up to two badges, each linked to verified code in its corresponding public repository. We describe the motivation, related initiatives, a formal framework, the potential impact, possible limitations, and alternative views.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07197v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training activation compression is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware. However, standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind: they preserve high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model. Our analysis reveals that \r{ho} serves as a fundamental signal of stored knowledge, with high-\r{ho} layers emerging only when models internalize factual associations during training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities yet frequently generate plausible but incorrect solutions, a phenomenon commonly termed hallucination. This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration. The complete training and evaluation pipeline, implemented efficiently through Low-Rank Adaptation, is released to facilitate further research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The inherent safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is prone to erosion during fine-tuning, even when using seemingly innocuous datasets. While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep protein structure predictors such as AlphaFold provide confidence estimates (e.g., pLDDT) that are often miscalibrated and degrade under distribution shifts across experimental modalities, temporal changes, and intrinsically disordered regions. We introduce CalPro, a prior-aware evidential-conformal framework for shift-robust uncertainty quantification. CalPro combines (i) a geometric evidential head that outputs Normal-Inverse-Gamma predictive distributions via a graph-based architecture; (ii) a differentiable conformal layer that enables end-to-end training with finite-sample coverage guarantees; and (iii) domain priors (disorder, flexibility) encoded as soft constraints. We derive structure-aware coverage guarantees under distribution shift using PAC-Bayesian bounds over ambiguity sets, and show that CalPro maintains near-nominal coverage while producing tighter intervals than standard conformal methods in regions where priors are informative. Empirically, CalPro exhibits at most 5% coverage degradation across modalities (vs. 15-25% for baselines), reduces calibration error by 30-50%, and improves downstream ligand-docking success by 25%. Beyond proteins, CalPro applies to structured regression tasks in which priors encode local reliability, validated on non-biological benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07208v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an efficient paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy is primarily confined to domains with verifiable ground truths. Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate energy time-series forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid stability and promoting the integration of renewable energy, yet it faces significant challenges from complex temporal dependencies and the heterogeneity of multi-source data. To address these issues, we propose DDT, a novel and robust deep learning framework for high-precision time-series forecasting. At its core, DDT introduces two key innovations. First, we design a dual-masking mechanism that synergistically combines a strict causal mask with a data-driven dynamic mask. This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques. Second, our architecture features a dual-expert system that decouples the modeling of temporal dynamics and cross-variable correlations into parallel, specialized pathways, which are then intelligently integrated through a dynamic gated fusion module. We conducted extensive experiments on 7 challenging energy benchmark datasets, including ETTh, Electricity, and Solar. The results demonstrate that DDT consistently outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines across all prediction horizons, establishing a new benchmark for the task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07257v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In noisy physical reservoirs, the classical information-processing capacity $C_{\mathrm{ip}}$ quantifies how well a linear readout can realize tasks measurable from the input history, yet $C_{\mathrm{ip}}$ can be far smaller than the observed rank of the readout covariance. We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{rank}(\Sigma_{XX})\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $\Sigma_{XX}\in \mathbb{R}^{\rm d\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $\Sigma_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07288v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has demonstrated success in dimensionality reduction for unlabeled multi-view data, most existing methods reduce feature redundancy by focusing on linear correlations among features but often overlook complex nonlinear dependencies. This limits the effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, existing methods fuse similarity graphs from multiple views by employing sample-invariant weights to preserve local structure. However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them. Extensive experiments on real multi-view datasets demonstrate the superiority of KAFUSE over state-of-the-art methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07316v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, prevalent supervised methods typically treat recordings as undifferentiated one-dimensional (1D) signals or two-dimensional (2D) images. This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07320v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is increasingly driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) provides a principled framework for stable policy updates. However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical notes hold rich yet unstructured details about diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes that are vital to precision medicine but hard to exploit at scale. We introduce a method that represents each patient as a matrix built from aggregated embeddings of all their notes, enabling robust patient similarity computation based on their latent low-rank representations. Using clinical notes of 4,267 Czech breast-cancer patients and expert similarity labels from Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, we evaluate several matrix-based similarity measures and analyze their strengths and limitations across different similarity facets, such as clinical history, treatment, and adverse events. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the presented method for downstream tasks, such as personalized therapy recommendations or toxicity warnings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07411v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07413v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are gaining great popularity in economics and social science because of their strong flexibility to describe the realistic and heterogeneous decisions and interaction rules between individual agents. In this work, we investigate for the first time the practicality of test-time training (TTT) of deep models such as normalizing flows, in the parameters posterior estimations of ABMs. We propose several practical TTT strategies for fine-tuning the normalizing flow against distribution shifts. Our numerical study demonstrates that TTT schemes are remarkably effective, enabling real-time adjustment of flow-based inference for ABM parameters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug discovery represents a time-consuming and financially intensive process, and virtual screening can accelerate it. Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

Traditional methods of spectral fitting such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) face limitations due to computational times. We introduce a probabilistic model, utilizing a variational autoencoder with a normalizing flow, trained to adopt a physical latent space. This neural network produces predictions for spectral-model parameters as well as their full probability distributions. Our implementations result in a significant improvement in spectral reconstructions over a previous deterministic model while performing three orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07442v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Global optimization of large-scale, complex systems such as multi-physics black-box simulations and real-world industrial systems is important but challenging. This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As models grow more capable, human supervision breaks down: labels don't scale, outputs can be gamed, and training doesn't generalize. Scalable oversight requires steering methods that are internal, self-supervised, and transfer out-of-distribution; existing methods satisfy some but not all three. We introduce AntiPaSTO, which separates representations along an anti-parallel axis ($\alpha=\pm1$ produce opposite shifts), with coherence constraints preventing collapse. Human input is minimal: two contrasting words inserted into template sentences, no preference labels. Using 800 such pairs on Gemma-3-1B, AntiPaSTO beats prompting baselines by $6.9\times$ on DailyDilemmas and maintains bidirectional control where prompting triggers refusal.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is critical in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, enabling simultaneous handling of diverse tasks. However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The emergence of fine-grained numerical formats like NVFP4 presents new opportunities for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant .

The vast label space and extreme class imbalance continue to challenge precise prediction. To address these issues, LabGraph is introduced -- a unified framework that reformulates ICD coding as a graph generation task. By combining adversarial domain adaptation, graph-based reinforcement learning, and perturbation regularization, LabGraph effectively enhances model robustness and generalization. In addition, a label graph discriminator dynamically evaluates each generated code, providing adaptive reward feedback during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LabGraph consistently outperforms previous approaches on micro-F1, micro-AUC, and P@K.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into autonomous agent systems has created unprecedented opportunities for document analysis, decision support, and knowledge retrieval. However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Singular learning theory characterizes Bayesian learning as an evolving tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, with transitions between qualitatively different solutions as sample size increases. We extend this theory to deep reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of the generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as "opposing staircases" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07545v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study differentially private ordinary least squares (DP-OLS) with bounded data. The dominant approach, adaptive sufficient-statistics perturbation (AdaSSP), adds an adaptively chosen perturbation to the sufficient statistics, namely, the matrix $X^{\top}X$ and the vector $X^{\top}Y$, and is known to achieve near-optimal accuracy and to have strong empirical performance. In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches. Then, we show that our new approach circumvents the intrinsic limitations of the prior methods and provides non-trivial improvements over AdaSSP. We conclude by running an extensive set of experiments across standard benchmarks to demonstrate further that our approach consistently outperforms these prior baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07548v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical time series data, such as EEG and ECG, are vital for diagnosing neurological and cardiovascular diseases. However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF. CoDAC offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical time series diagnosis, effectively mitigating data scarcity challenges.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07550v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering is crucial for signal processing and data analysis. Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In an ideal medical environment, real-time coagulation monitoring can enable early detection and prompt remediation of risks. However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement. The delay might lead to elevated mortality rates. These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too. Drift-aware learning suggests a new future, with potential uses well be-yond thrombophilia discovery towards medical AI applica-tions with data scarcity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07636v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to sequentially learn multiple tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. Recent studies have shown that optimizing towards flatter loss minima can improve model generalization. However, existing sharpness-aware methods for CL suffer from two key limitations: (1) they treat sharpness regularization as a unified signal without distinguishing the contributions of its components. and (2) they introduce substantial computational overhead that impedes practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FLAD, a novel optimization framework that decomposes sharpness-aware perturbations into gradient-aligned and stochastic-noise components, and show that retaining only the noise component promotes generalization. We further introduce a lightweight scheduling scheme that enables FLAD to maintain significant performance gains even under constrained training time. FLAD can be seamlessly integrated into various CL paradigms and consistently outperforms standard and sharpness-aware optimizers in diverse experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in CL.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Tab-TRM (Tabular-Tiny Recursive Model), a network architecture that adapts the recursive latent reasoning paradigm of Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) to insurance modeling. Drawing inspiration from both the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and its simplified successor TRM, the Tab-TRM model makes predictions by reasoning over the input features. It maintains two learnable latent tokens - an answer token and a reasoning state - that are iteratively refined by a compact, parameter-efficient recursive network. The recursive processing layer repeatedly updates the reasoning state given the full token sequence and then refines the answer token, in close analogy with iterative insurance pricing schemes. Conceptually, Tab-TRM bridges classical actuarial workflows - iterative generalized linear model fitting and minimum-bias calibration - on the one hand, and modern machine learning, in terms of Gradient Boosting Machines, on the other.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07748v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training with contrastive learning is a powerful method for learning from sparsely labeled data. However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07760v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07767v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07778v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce DT-ICU, a multimodal digital twin framework for continuous risk estimation in intensive care. DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care. The source code and trained model weights for DT-ICU are publicly available at https://github.com/GUO-W/DT-ICU-release.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07830v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05376v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\kappa = 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05455v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Answering real-world open-domain multi-hop questions over massive corpora is a critical challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery. Experiments show that PRISMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten benchmarks and can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios.

However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05500v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.   Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05578v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05590v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the   learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05629v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05637v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05656v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05693v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05724v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Verification is a key bottleneck in improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity in Speculative Decoding. Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05739v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05746v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05787v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05890v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.05991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bipedal humanoid robots must precisely coordinate balance, timing, and contact decisions when locomoting on constrained footholds such as stepping stones, beams, and planks -- even minor errors can lead to catastrophic failure. Classical optimization and control pipelines handle these constraints well but depend on highly accurate mathematical representations of terrain geometry, making them prone to error when perception is noisy or incomplete. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning has shown strong resilience to disturbances and modeling errors, yet end-to-end policies rarely discover the precise foothold placement and step sequencing required for discontinuous terrain. These contrasting limitations motivate approaches that guide learning with physics-based structure rather than relying purely on reward shaping. In this work, we introduce a locomotion framework in which a reduced-order stepping planner supplies dynamically consistent motion targets that steer the RL training process via Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) rewards. This combination of structured footstep planning and data-driven adaptation produces accurate, agile, and hardware-validated stepping-stone locomotion on a humanoid robot, substantially improving reliability compared to conventional model-free reinforcement-learning baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Utilizing functional elements in an industrial environment, such as displays and interactive valves, provide effective possibilities for robot training. When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments. This will serve as a foundation to include the relations of functional and actionable elements, which then can be used for dynamic simulation and reasoning. Key results of this research include both quantitative results of the generated semantic labels as well as qualitative results of the scene graph, especially in hindsight of pipe structures and identified functional relations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Food cutting is a highly practical yet underexplored application at the intersection of vision and robotic manipulation. The task remains challenging because interactions between the knife and deformable materials are highly nonlinear and often entail large deformations, frequent contact, and topological change, which in turn hinder stable and safe large-scale data collection.   To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that couples a vision-language-action (VLA) dataset with a physically realistic cutting simulator built on the material point method (MPM). Our simulator adopts MLS-MPM as its computational core, reducing numerical dissipation and energy drift while preserving rotational and shear responses even under topology-changing cuts. During cutting, forces and stress distributions are estimated from impulse exchanges between particles and the grid, enabling stable tracking of transient contact forces and energy transfer.   We also provide a benchmark dataset that integrates diverse cutting trajectories, multi-view visual observations, and fine-grained language instructions, together with force--torque and tool--pose labels to provide physically consistent training signals.   These components realize a learning--evaluation loop that respects the core physics of cutting and establishes a safe, reproducible, and scalable foundation for advancing VLA models in deformable object manipulation.

This paper presents the design, deployment, and testing of a novel multi-drone system for automated mural painting in outdoor settings. This technology makes use of new software that coordinates multiple drones simultaneously, utilizing state-machine algorithms for task execution. Key advancements are the complex positioning system that combines 2D localization using a single motion tracking camera with onboard LiDAR for precise positioning, and a novel flight control algorithm, which works differently along the trajectory and normally to it, ensuring smoothness and high precision of the drawings at the same time. A 100 square meters mural was created using the developed multi-drone system, validating the system's efficacy. Compared to single-drone approaches, our multi-UAV solution significantly improves scalability and operational speed while maintaining high stability even in harsh weather conditions. The findings highlight the potential of autonomous robotic swarms in creative applications, paving the way for further advancements in large-scale robotic art.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06552v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Whenever humans and robots work together, it is essential that unexpected robot behavior can be explained to the user. Especially in applications such as shared control the user and the robot must share the same model of the objects in the world, and the actions that can be performed on these objects.   In this paper, we achieve this with a so-called model reconciliation framework. We leverage a Large Language Model to predict and explain the difference between the robot's and the human's mental models, without the need of a formal mental model of the user. Furthermore, our framework aims to solve the model divergence after the explanation by allowing the human to correct the robot. We provide an implementation in an assistive robotics domain, where we conduct a set of experiments with a real wheelchair-based mobile manipulator and its digital twin.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06602v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inertial localization is particularly valuable in GPS-denied environments such as indoors. However, localization using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) suffers from drift caused by motion-process noise and sensor biases. This paper introduces Uncertainty-aware Map-constrained Inertial Localization (UMLoc), an end-to-end framework that jointly models IMU uncertainty and map constraints to achieve drift-resilient positioning. UMLoc integrates two coupled modules: (1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) quantile regressor, which estimates the specific quantiles needed to define 68%, 90%, and 95% prediction intervals serving as a measure of localization uncertainty and (2) a Conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with cross-attention that fuses IMU dynamic data with distance-based floor-plan maps to generate geometrically feasible trajectories. The modules are trained jointly, allowing uncertainty estimates to propagate through the CGAN during trajectory generation. UMLoc was evaluated on three datasets, including a newly collected 2-hour indoor benchmark with time-aligned IMU data, ground-truth poses and floor-plan maps. Results show that the method achieves a mean drift ratio of 5.9% over a 70 m travel distance and an average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 1.36 m, while maintaining calibrated prediction bounds.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) treatments frequently employ transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for procedures such as the removal of tumors or polyps. In TLM, a laser beam is used to cut target tissue, while forceps are employed to grasp, manipulate, and stabilize tissue within the UADT. Although TLM systems may rely on different technologies and interfaces, forceps manipulation is still predominantly performed manually, introducing limitations in ergonomics, precision, and controllability. This paper proposes a novel robotic system for tissue manipulation in UADT procedures, based on a novel end-effector designed for forceps control. The system is integrated within a teleoperation framework that employs a robotic manipulator with a programmed remote center of motion (RCM), enabling precise and constrained instrument motion while improving surgeon ergonomics. The proposed approach is validated through two experimental studies and a dedicated usability evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and suitability for UADT surgical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06652v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments often relies on geometric mapping and planning strategies that overlook rich semantic cues such as signs, room numbers, and textual labels. We propose a novel semantic navigation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer patterns from partial observations and predict regions where the goal is most likely located. Our method combines local perceptual inputs with frontier-based exploration and periodic LLM queries, which extract symbolic patterns (e.g., room numbering schemes and building layout structures) and update a confidence grid used to guide exploration. This enables robots to move efficiently toward goal locations labeled with textual identifiers (e.g., "room 8") even before direct observation. We demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient navigation in sparse, partially observable grid environments by exploiting symbolic patterns. Experiments across environments modeled after real floor plans show that our approach consistently achieves near-optimal paths and outperforms baselines by over 25% in Success weighted by Path Length.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06728v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drone light shows have emerged as a popular form of entertainment in recent years. However, several high-profile incidents involving large-scale drone failures -- where multiple drones simultaneously fall from the sky -- have raised safety and reliability concerns. To ensure robustness, we propose a drone parking algorithm designed specifically for multiple drone failures in drone light shows, aimed at mitigating the risk of cascading collisions by drone evacuation and enabling rapid recovery from failures by leveraging strategically placed hidden drones. Our algorithm integrates a Social LSTM model with attention mechanisms to predict the trajectories of failing drones and compute near-optimal evacuation paths that minimize the likelihood of surviving drones being hit by fallen drones. In the recovery node, our system deploys hidden drones (operating with their LED lights turned off) to replace failed drones so that the drone light show can continue. Our experiments showed that our approach can greatly increase the robustness of a multi-drone system by leveraging deep learning to predict the trajectories of fallen drones.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06748v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for general-purpose robot learning, enabling agents to map visual observations and natural-language instructions into executable robotic actions. Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06833v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a single-actuator passive gripper that achieves both stable grasping and continuous bidirectional in-hand rotation through mechanically encoded power transmission logic. Unlike conventional multifunctional grippers that require multiple actuators, sensors, or control-based switching, the proposed gripper transitions between grasping and rotation solely according to the magnitude of the applied input torque. The key enabler of this behavior is a Twisted Underactuated Mechanism (TUM), which generates non-coplanar motions, namely axial contraction and rotation, from a single rotational input while producing identical contraction regardless of rotation direction. A friction generator mechanically defines torque thresholds that govern passive mode switching, enabling stable grasp establishment before autonomously transitioning to in-hand rotation without sensing or active control. Analytical models describing the kinematics, elastic force generation, and torque transmission of the TUM are derived and experimentally validated. The fabricated gripper is evaluated through quantitative experiments on grasp success, friction-based grasp force regulation, and bidirectional rotation performance. System-level demonstrations, including bolt manipulation, object reorientation, and manipulator-integrated tasks driven solely by wrist torque, confirm reliable grasp to rotate transitions in both rotational directions. These results demonstrate that non-coplanar multifunctional manipulation can be realized through mechanical design alone, establishing mechanically encoded power transmission logic as a robust alternative to actuator and control intensive gripper architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel family of single-track vehicle models that incorporate a distributed representation of transient tyre dynamics, whilst simultaneously accounting for nonlinear effects induced by friction. The core of the proposed framework is represented by the distributed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) model, which unifies and extends classical formulations such as Dahl and LuGre by describing the rolling contact process as a spatially distributed system governed by semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This model is systematically integrated into a single-track vehicle framework, where the resulting semilinear ODE-PDE interconnection captures the interaction between lateral vehicle motion and tyre deformation. Two main variants are considered: one with rigid tyre carcass and another with flexible carcass, each admitting a compact state-space representation. Local and global well-posedness properties for the coupled system are established rigorously, highlighting the dissipative and physically consistent properties of the distributed FrBD model. A linearisation procedure is also presented, enabling spectral analysis and transfer function derivation, and potentially facilitating the synthesis of controllers and observers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to capture micro-shimmy oscillations and transient lateral responses to advanced steering manoeuvres. The proposed formulation advances the state-of-the-art in vehicle dynamics modelling by providing a physically grounded, mathematically rigorous, and computationally tractable approach to incorporating transient tyre behaviour in lateral vehicle dynamics, when accounting for the effect of limited friction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06887v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular vision-based target motion estimation is a fundamental challenge in numerous applications. This work introduces a novel bearing-box approach that fully leverages modern 3D detection measurements that are widely available nowadays but have not been well explored for motion estimation so far. Unlike existing methods that rely on restrictive assumptions such as isotropic target shape and lateral motion, our bearing-box estimator can estimate both the target's motion and its physical size without these assumptions by exploiting the information buried in a 3D bounding box. When applied to multi-rotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), the estimator yields an interesting advantage: it further removes the need for higher-order motion assumptions by exploiting the unique coupling between MAV's acceleration and thrust. This is particularly significant, as higher-order motion assumptions are widely believed to be necessary in state-of-the-art bearing-based estimators. We support our claims with rigorous observability analyses and extensive experimental validation, demonstrating the estimator's superior performance in real-world scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.06997v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous high-fidelity object reconstruction is fundamental for creating digital assets and bridging the simulation-to-reality gap in robotics. We present ObjSplat, an active reconstruction framework that leverages Gaussian surfels as a unified representation to progressively reconstruct unknown objects with both photorealistic appearance and accurate geometry. Addressing the limitations of conventional opacity or depth-based cues, we introduce a geometry-aware viewpoint evaluation pipeline that explicitly models back-face visibility and occlusion-aware multi-view covisibility, reliably identifying under-reconstructed regions even on geometrically complex objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of greedy planning strategies, ObjSplat employs a next-best-path (NBP) planner that performs multi-step lookahead on a dynamically constructed spatial graph. By jointly optimizing information gain and movement cost, this planner generates globally efficient trajectories. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real-world cultural artifacts demonstrate that ObjSplat produces physically consistent models within minutes, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and surface completeness while significantly reducing scan time and path length compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Development of dexterous robotic joints is essential for advancing manipulation capabilities in robotic systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of a tendon-driven robotic wrist joint together with an efficient Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) for precise motion control. The wrist mechanism is modeled using a Timoshenko-based approach to accurately capture its kinematic and dynamic properties, which serve as the foundation for tendon force calculations within the controller. The proposed SMC is designed to deliver fast dynamic response and computational efficiency, enabling accurate trajectory tracking under varying operating conditions. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through comparative analyses with existing controllers for similar wrist mechanisms. The proposed SMC demonstrates superior performance in both simulation and experimental studies. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in simulation is approximately 1.67e-2 radians, while experimental validation yields an error of 0.2 radians. Additionally, the controller achieves a settling time of less than 3 seconds and a steady-state error below 1e-1 radians, consistently observed across both simulation and experimental evaluations. Comparative analyses confirm that the developed SMC surpasses alternative control strategies in motion accuracy, rapid convergence, and steady-state precision. This work establishes a foundation for future exploration of tendon-driven wrist mechanisms and control strategies in robotic applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulation is crucial in real-world robotics, offering safe, scalable, and efficient environments for developing applications, ranging from humanoid robots to autonomous vehicles and drones. While the Robot Operating System (ROS) has been widely adopted as the backbone of these robotic applications in both academia and industry, its asynchronous, multiprocess design complicates reproducibility, especially across varying hardware platforms. Deterministic callback execution cannot be guaranteed when computation times and communication delays vary. This lack of reproducibility complicates scientific benchmarking and continuous integration, where consistent results are essential. To address this, we present a methodology to create deterministic simulations using ROS 2 nodes. Our ROS Simulation Library for C++ (RSLCPP) implements this approach, enabling existing nodes to be combined into a simulation routine that yields reproducible results without requiring any code changes. We demonstrate that our approach yields identical results across various CPUs and architectures when testing both a synthetic benchmark and a real-world robotics system.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in robotic manipulation, yet they continue to struggle with long-horizon, multi-step tasks. Existing methods lack internal reasoning mechanisms that can identify task-relevant interaction cues or track progress within a subtask, leading to critical execution errors such as repeated actions, missed steps, and premature termination. To address these challenges, we introduce PALM, a VLA framework that structures policy learning around interaction-centric affordance reasoning and subtask progress cues. PALM distills complementary affordance representations that capture object relevance, contact geometry, spatial placements, and motion dynamics, and serve as task-relevant anchors for visuomotor control. To further stabilize long-horizon execution, PALM predicts continuous within-subtask progress, enabling seamless subtask transitions. Across extensive simulation and real-world experiments, PALM consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 91.8% success rate on LIBERO-LONG, a 12.5% improvement in average length on CALVIN ABC->D, and a 2x improvement over real-world baselines across three long-horizon generalization settings.

Recent work on adversarial attacks has revealed significant vulnerabilities in existing robot task planners, especially those built on foundation models.

PROTEA is developed to address the dimensionality and history challenges in plan safety assessment. We used different LLMs to implement multiple versions of PROTEA for comparison purposes. For systemic evaluations, we created a dataset containing both benign and malicious task plans, where the harmful behaviors were injected at varying levels of stealthiness. Our results provide actionable insights for robotic system practitioners seeking to enhance robustness and security of their task planning systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07242v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present HERE, an active 3D scene reconstruction framework based on neural radiance fields, enabling high-fidelity implicit mapping. Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retargeting human motion to heterogeneous robots is a fundamental challenge in robotics, primarily due to the severe kinematic and dynamic discrepancies between varying embodiments. Existing solutions typically resort to training embodiment-specific models, which scales poorly and fails to exploit shared motion semantics. To address this, we present AdaMorph, a unified neural retargeting framework that enables a single model to adapt human motion to diverse robot morphologies. Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration. Experimental results on 12 distinct humanoid robots demonstrate that AdaMorph effectively unifies control across heterogeneous topologies, exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to unseen complex motions while preserving the dynamic essence of the source behaviors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\% (compared to 62.5\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.

Yet, obtaining accurate near-surface measurements remains hazardous and logistically challenging, motivating the need for autonomous solutions. Limited mobility in rough volcanic terrain has prevented wheeled systems from performing reliable in situ gas measurements, reducing their usefulness as sensing platforms. We present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, utilizing the quadruped ANYmal, equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our modular autonomy stack integrates a mission planning interface, global planner, localization framework, and terrain-aware local navigation. We evaluated the system on Mount Etna across three autonomous missions in varied terrain, achieving successful gas-source detections with autonomy rates of 93-100%. In addition, we conducted a teleoperated mission in which the robot measured natural fumaroles, detecting sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. We discuss lessons learned from the gas-analysis and autonomy perspectives, emphasizing the need for adaptive sensing strategies, tighter integration of global and local planning, and improved hardware design.

This article presents an integrated planning and control framework for high-speed, time-optimal autonomous flight of MAVs in cluttered environments. In each replanning cycle (100 Hz), a time-optimal trajectory under polynomial presentation is generated as a reference, with the time-allocation process accelerated by imitation learning. Subsequently, a time-optimal model predictive contouring control (MPCC) incorporates safe flight corridor (SFC) constraints at variable horizon steps to enable aggressive yet safe maneuvering, while fully exploiting the MAV's dynamics. We validate the proposed framework extensively on a custom-built LiDAR-based MAV platform. Simulation results demonstrate superior aggressiveness compared to the state of the art, while real-world experiments achieve a peak speed of 18 m/s in a cluttered environment and succeed in 10 consecutive trials from diverse start points.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reliable humanoid-robot interaction (HRI) in household environments is constrained by two fundamental requirements, namely robustness to unconstrained user positions and preservation of user privacy. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing inherently supports privacy-preserving interaction, making it a promising modality for room-scale HRI. However, existing mmWave-based interaction-sensing systems exhibit poor spatial generalization at unseen distances or viewpoints. To address this challenge, we introduce WaveMan, a spatially adaptive room-scale perception system that restores reliable human interaction sensing across arbitrary user positions. WaveMan integrates viewpoint alignment and spectrogram enhancement for spatial consistency, with dual-channel attention for robust feature extraction. Experiments across five participants show that, under fixed-position evaluation, WaveMan achieves the same cross-position accuracy as the baseline with five times fewer training positions. In random free-position testing, accuracy increases from 33.00% to 94.33%, enabled by the proposed method. These results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable, privacy-preserving interaction for household humanoid robots across unconstrained user positions.

Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07558v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and designed with motors enclosed inside to protect them from damage and dirt. Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism. The hand also successfully executed several daily tasks, including closing bottle caps and orienting a pen for writing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07701v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current approaches to humanoid control generally fall into two paradigms: perceptive locomotion, which handles terrain well but is limited to pedal gaits, and general motion tracking, which reproduces complex skills but ignores environmental capabilities. This work unites these paradigms to achieve perceptive general motion control. We present a framework where exteroceptive sensing is integrated into whole-body motion tracking, permitting a humanoid to perform highly dynamic, non-locomotion tasks on uneven terrain. By training a single policy to perform multiple distinct motions across varied terrestrial features, we demonstrate the non-trivial benefit of integrating perception into the control loop. Our results show that this framework enables robust, highly dynamic multi-contact motions, such as vaulting and dive-rolling, on unstructured terrain, significantly expanding the robot's traversability beyond simple walking or running. https://project-instinct.github.io/deep-whole-body-parkour

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07718v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07768v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The teleoperation of robotic hands is limited by the high costs of depth cameras and sensor gloves, commonly used to estimate hand relative joint positions (XYZ). We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.07821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning can push the limits of robotic models for specific objectives, such as generalizability, accuracy, and robustness. However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training. Videos and code are available at https://failure-aware-rl.github.io.
