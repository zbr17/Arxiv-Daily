- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04175v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalizing deepfake detection to unseen manipulations remains a key challenge. A recent approach to tackle this issue is to train a network with pristine face images that have been manipulated with hand-crafted artifacts to extract more generalizable clues. While effective for static images, extending this to the video domain is an open issue. Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing. A network trained on our data learns to spot these sophisticated biomechanical flaws, achieving state-of-the-art generalization results on several popular benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04187v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The microscopic examination of surgical tissue remains a cornerstone of disease classification but relies on subjective interpretations and access to highly specialized experts, which can compromise accuracy and clinical care. While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents LAPA (Look Around and Pay Attention), a novel end-to-end transformer-based architecture for multi-camera point tracking that integrates appearance-based matching with geometric constraints. Traditional pipelines decouple detection, association, and tracking, leading to error propagation and temporal inconsistency in challenging scenarios. LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

- **标题**: Generalized Event Partonomy Inference with Structured Hierarchical Predictive Learning

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04219v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans naturally perceive continuous experience as a hierarchy of temporally nested events, fine-grained actions embedded within coarser routines. Replicating this structure in computer vision requires models that can segment video not just retrospectively, but predictively and hierarchically. We introduce PARSE, a unified framework that learns multiscale event structure directly from streaming video without supervision. PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback. Event boundaries emerge naturally as transient peaks in prediction error, yielding temporally coherent, nested partonomies that mirror the containment relations observed in human event perception. Evaluated across three benchmarks, Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and Assembly 101, PARSE achieves state-of-the-art performance among streaming methods and rivals offline baselines in both temporal alignment (H-GEBD) and structural consistency (TED, hF1). The results demonstrate that predictive learning under uncertainty provides a scalable path toward human-like temporal abstraction and compositional event understanding.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in photorealism, generating intent-aligned videos that faithfully obey physics principles remains a core challenge. In this work, we systematically study Newtonian motion-controlled text-to-video generation and evaluation, emphasizing physical precision and motion coherence. We introduce MoReGen, a motion-aware, physics-grounded T2V framework that integrates multi-agent LLMs, physics simulators, and renderers to generate reproducible, physically accurate videos from text prompts in the code domain. To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators. Our results reveal that state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain physical validity, while MoReGen establishes a principled direction toward physically coherent video synthesis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims to separate images into physical components such as albedo, depth, normals, and illumination. While recent diffusion- and transformer-based models benefit from paired supervision from synthetic datasets, their generalization to diverse, real-world scenarios remains challenging. We propose ReasonX, a novel framework that leverages a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a perceptual judge providing relative intrinsic comparisons, and uses these comparisons as GRPO rewards for fine-tuning intrinsic decomposition models on unlabeled, in-the-wild images. Unlike RL methods for generative models, our framework aligns conditional intrinsic predictors by rewarding agreement between the judge's relational assessments and analytically derived relations from the model's outputs. ReasonX is model-agnostic and can be applied to different intrinsic predictors. Across multiple base architectures and modalities, ReasonX yields significant improvements, including 9-25% WHDR reduction on IIW albedo and up to 46% depth accuracy gains on ETH3D, highlighting the promise of MLLM-guided comparative supervision to bridge low- and high-level vision reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04238v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess performance on common anatomical presentations and fail to capture the challenges posed by rare variants. To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about "typical" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations. AdversarialAnatomyBench provides a foundation for systematically measuring and mitigating anatomical bias in multimodal medical AI systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04248v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce MVRoom, a controllable novel view synthesis (NVS) pipeline for 3D indoor scenes that uses multi-view diffusion conditioned on a coarse 3D layout. MVRoom employs a two-stage design in which the 3D layout is used throughout to enforce multi-view consistency. The first stage employs novel representations to effectively bridge the 3D layout and consistent image-based condition signals for multi-view generation. The second stage performs image-conditioned multi-view generation, incorporating a layout-aware epipolar attention mechanism to enhance multi-view consistency during the diffusion process. Additionally, we introduce an iterative framework that generates 3D scenes with varying numbers of objects and scene complexities by recursively performing multi-view generation (MVRoom), supporting text-to-scene generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-fidelity and controllable 3D scene generation for NVS, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components within our generation pipeline.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lighting has a strong influence on visual appearance, yet understanding and representing lighting in images remains notoriously difficult. Various lighting representations exist, such as environment maps, irradiance, spherical harmonics, or text, but they are incompatible, which limits cross-modal transfer. We thus propose UniLight, a joint latent space as lighting representation, that unifies multiple modalities within a shared embedding. Modality-specific encoders for text, images, irradiance, and environment maps are trained contrastively to align their representations, with an auxiliary spherical-harmonics prediction task reinforcing directional understanding. Our multi-modal data pipeline enables large-scale training and evaluation across three tasks: lighting-based retrieval, environment-map generation, and lighting control in diffusion-based image synthesis. Experiments show that our representation captures consistent and transferable lighting features, enabling flexible manipulation across modalities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04283v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flow matching-based generative models have been integrated into the plug-and-play image restoration framework, and the resulting plug-and-play flow matching (PnP-Flow) model has achieved some remarkable empirical success for image restoration. However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Numerical results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline PnP-Flow and other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across evaluation metrics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly complex, with input data sizes scaling accordingly. Despite substantial advances in specialized deep learning hardware, data loading continues to be a major bottleneck that limits training and inference speed. To address this challenge, we propose training models directly on encoded JPEG features, reducing the computational overhead associated with full JPEG decoding and significantly improving data loading efficiency. While prior works have focused on recognition tasks, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the restoration task of single-image super-resolution (SISR). We present a lightweight super-resolution pipeline that operates on JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the frequency domain. Our pipeline achieves a 2.6x speedup in data loading and a 2.5x speedup in training, while preserving visual quality comparable to standard SISR approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04303v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate perception of the vehicle's 3D surroundings, including fine-scale road geometry, such as bumps, slopes, and surface irregularities, is essential for safe and comfortable vehicle control. However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04305v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While vision-language models like CLIP have been extensively studied, their calibration, crucial for reliable predictions, has received limited attention. Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image captioning has drawn considerable attention from the natural language processing and computer vision fields. Aiming to reduce the reliance on curated data, several studies have explored image captioning without any humanly-annotated image-text pairs for training, although existing methods are still outperformed by fully supervised approaches. This paper proposes TOMCap, i.e., an improved text-only training method that performs captioning without the need for aligned image-caption pairs. The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we show that TOMCap outperforms other training-free and text-only methods. We also analyze the impact of different choices regarding the configuration of the retrieval-augmentation and modality gap reduction components.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04311v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources is driving increasing interest in edible insects, with Acheta domesticus (house cricket) identified as one of the most suitable species for industrial production. Current farming practices typically rear crickets in mixed-sex populations without automated sex sorting, despite potential benefits such as selective breeding, optimized reproduction ratios, and nutritional differentiation. This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained devices for insect farming applications, offering a practical solution to improve efficiency and sustainability in cricket production.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current expressive avatar systems rely heavily on visual cues, failing when faces are occluded or when emotions remain internal. We present Mind-to-Face, the first framework that decodes non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals directly into high-fidelity facial expressions. We build a dual-modality recording setup to obtain synchronized EEG and multi-view facial video during emotion-eliciting stimuli, enabling precise supervision for neural-to-visual learning. Our model uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to map EEG signals into dense 3D position maps, capable of sampling over 65k vertices, capturing fine-scale geometry and subtle emotional dynamics, and renders them through a modified 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline for photorealistic, view-consistent results. Through extensive evaluation, we show that EEG alone can reliably predict dynamic, subject-specific facial expressions, including subtle emotional responses, demonstrating that neural signals contain far richer affective and geometric information than previously assumed. Mind-to-Face establishes a new paradigm for neural-driven avatars, enabling personalized, emotion-aware telepresence and cognitive interaction in immersive environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Transformers face a fundamental limitation: standard self-attention jointly processes spatial and channel dimensions, leading to entangled representations that prevent independent modeling of structural and semantic dependencies. This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D scenes is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature, which requires aggregating information from multiple views to reconstruct time-evolving 3D geometry and motion. We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first general 4D Gaussian Splatting approach for unsynchronized video sets, without assuming the existence of predefined scene objects or prior models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04323v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for generating high-quality Digital Image Correlation (DIC) dataset based on non-uniform B-spline surfaces. By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks. Through these innovations, this paper offers new perspectives and methods for dataset generation and algorithm performance enhancement in the field of DIC.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reusing existing neural-network components is central to research efficiency, yet discovering, extracting, and validating such modules across thousands of open-source repositories remains difficult. We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code. Overall, NN-RAG transforms fragmented vision code into a reproducible, provenance-tracked substrate for algorithmic discovery, offering a first open-source solution that both quantifies and expands the diversity of executable neural architectures across repositories.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The proliferation of face forgeries has increasingly undermined confidence in the authenticity of online content. Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories. Moreover, on the traditional Real-versus-Fake face forgery detection task, our DLED method concurrently exhibits competitive performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04358v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing stereo matching networks typically rely on either cost-volume construction based on 3D convolutions or deformation methods based on iterative optimization. The former incurs significant computational overhead during cost aggregation, whereas the latter often lacks the ability to model non-local contextual information. These methods exhibit poor compatibility on resource-constrained mobile devices, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. To address this, we propose a Multi-frequency Adaptive Fusion Network (MAFNet), which can produce high-quality disparity maps using only efficient 2D convolutions. Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAFNet significantly outperforms existing real-time methods on public datasets such as Scene Flow and KITTI 2015, showing a favorable balance between accuracy and real-time performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04390v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world video restoration is plagued by complex degradations from motion coupled with dynamically varying exposure - a key challenge largely overlooked by prior works and a common artifact of auto-exposure or low-light capture. We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04395v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods typically learn holistic representations where an image's domain-invariant structure is implicitly entangled with its domain-specific style. This presents an opportunity to further enhance generalization by disentangling these visual cues. In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image classification plays an increasingly vital role in identifying various diseases by classifying medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, into different categories based on their features. In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04413v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective and hardware-friendly method, which plays a key role in lightweighting remote sensing object detection. However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches. The source code will be available at https://github.com/PolarAid/DS2D2.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04421v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ray tracing 3D Gaussian particles enables realistic effects such as depth of field, refractions, and flexible camera modeling for novel-view synthesis. However, existing methods trace Gaussians through proxy geometry, which requires constructing complex intermediate meshes and performing costly intersection tests. This limitation arises because Gaussian-based particles are not well suited as unified primitives for both ray tracing and rasterization. In this work, we propose a differentiable triangle-based ray tracing pipeline that directly treats triangles as rendering primitives without relying on any proxy geometry. Our results show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher rendering quality than existing ray tracing approaches while maintaining real-time rendering performance. Moreover, our pipeline can directly render triangles optimized by the rasterization-based method Triangle Splatting, thus unifying the primitives used in novel-view synthesis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As a challenging video editing task, movie trailer generation involves selecting and reorganizing movie shots to create engaging trailers. Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a "selection-then-ranking" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods. Demo is available at: https://github.com/Dixin-Lab/SSMP.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04441v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-End autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a new paradigm, where trajectory planning plays a crucial role. Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As embodied intelligence advances toward real-world deployment, the ability to continuously perceive and reason over streaming visual inputs becomes essential. In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data. The code is available at https://github.com/chjinny/GuidNoise.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04459v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The autonomous driving community is increasingly focused on addressing the challenges posed by out-of-distribution (OOD) driving scenarios. A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios. These results suggest a controllable and reliable pathway for scalable end-to-end driving.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04461v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One of the primary objectives of satellite remote sensing is to capture the complex dynamics of the Earth environment, which encompasses tasks such as reconstructing continuous cloud-free time series images, detecting land cover changes, and forecasting future surface evolution. However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents DeRA, a novel 1D video tokenizer that decouples the spatial-temporal representation learning in video tokenization to achieve better training efficiency and performance. Specifically, DeRA maintains a compact 1D latent space while factorizing video encoding into appearance and motion streams, which are aligned with pretrained vision foundation models to capture the spatial semantics and temporal dynamics in videos separately. To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD. Moreover, using DeRA for autoregressive video generation, we also achieve new state-of-the-art results on both UCF-101 class-conditional generation and K600 frame prediction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since the advent of controllable image generation, increasingly rich modes of control have enabled greater customization and accessibility for everyday users. Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating stable and controllable character motion in real-time is a key challenge in computer animation. Existing methods often fail to provide fine-grained control or suffer from motion degradation over long sequences, limiting their use in interactive applications. We propose COMET, an autoregressive framework that runs in real time, enabling versatile character control and robust long-horizon synthesis. Our efficient Transformer-based conditional VAE allows for precise, interactive control over arbitrary user-specified joints for tasks like goal-reaching and in-betweening from a single model. To ensure long-term temporal stability, we introduce a novel reference-guided feedback mechanism that prevents error accumulation. This mechanism also serves as a plug-and-play stylization module, enabling real-time style transfer. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that COMET robustly generates high-quality motion at real-time speeds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in complex motion control tasks and confirming its readiness for demanding interactive applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04496v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inevitable specular highlights in practical environments severely impair the visual performance, thus degrading the task effectiveness and efficiency. Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark tasks and six types of surface materials demonstrate that MM-SHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency for specular highlight removal. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Htcicv/MM-SHR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04499v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a widely utilized and successful methodology in human motion synthesis. Task-oriented diffusion models have significantly advanced action-to-motion, text-to-motion, and audio-to-motion applications. In this paper, we investigate fundamental questions regarding motion representations and loss functions in a controlled study, and we enumerate the impacts of various decisions in the workflow of the generative motion diffusion model. To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models. Finally, we also conduct evaluation analysis on a large motion dataset. The results of our experiments indicate clear performance differences across motion representations in diverse datasets. Our results also demonstrate the impacts of distinct configurations on model training and suggest the importance and effectiveness of these decisions on the outcomes of motion diffusion models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04504v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent image diffusion transformers achieve high-fidelity generation, but struggle to generate images beyond these scales, suffering from content repetition and quality degradation. In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04511v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Infrared imaging plays a critical role in low-light and adverse weather conditions. However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over both supervised and self-supervised comparison methods. Our code is available in the supplementary material.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating long, coherent egocentric videos is difficult, as hand-object interactions and procedural tasks require reliable long-term memory. Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04519v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) diffusion enables streaming, interactive long-video generation by producing frames causally, yet maintaining coherence over minute-scale horizons remains challenging due to accumulated errors, motion drift, and content repetition. We approach this problem from a memory perspective, treating video synthesis as a recurrent dynamical process that requires coordinated short- and long-term context. We propose VideoSSM, a Long Video Model that unifies AR diffusion with a hybrid state-space memory. The state-space model (SSM) serves as an evolving global memory of scene dynamics across the entire sequence, while a context window provides local memory for motion cues and fine details. This hybrid design preserves global consistency without frozen, repetitive patterns, supports prompt-adaptive interaction, and scales in linear time with sequence length. Experiments on short- and long-range benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art temporal consistency and motion stability among autoregressive video generator especially at minute-scale horizons, enabling content diversity and interactive prompt-based control, thereby establishing a scalable, memory-aware framework for long video generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04520v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to the scarcity of annotated data and the substantial computational costs of model, conventional tuning methods in medical image segmentation face critical challenges. Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emilychenlin/BA-TTA-SAM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04521v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While fulfilling communication tasks, wireless signals can also be used to sense the environment. Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04522v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modal matching task due to significant modality discrepancies. While current methods mainly focus on learning modality-invariant features through unified embedding spaces, they often focus solely on the common discriminative semantics across modalities while disregarding the critical role of modality-specific identity-aware knowledge in discriminative feature learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features. Finally, an Identity Clues Guided (ICG) Loss is proposed to alleviate the modality discrepancies within the enhanced features and promote the learning of a diverse representation space. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets clearly show that our proposed ICRE outperforms existing SOTA methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional high-quality 3D scanning and reconstruction typically relies on human labor to plan the scanning procedure. With the rapid development of embodied systems such as drones and robots, there is a growing demand of performing accurate 3D scanning and reconstruction in an fully automated manner. We introduce Auto3R, a data-driven uncertainty quantification model that is designed to automate the 3D scanning and reconstruction of scenes and objects, including objects with non-lambertian and specular materials. Specifically, in a process of iterative 3D reconstruction and scanning, Auto3R can make efficient and accurate prediction of uncertainty distribution over potential scanning viewpoints, without knowing the ground truth geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments, Auto3R achieves superior performance that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We also deploy Auto3R on a robot arm equipped with a camera and demonstrate that Auto3R can be used to effectively digitize real-world 3D objects and delivers ready-to-use and photorealistic digital assets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of video-language tasks. However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04534v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable progress in image and video editing, yet some tasks remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Object Retexture, which transfers local textures from a reference object to a target object in images or videos. To perform this task, a straightforward solution is to use ControlNet conditioned on the source structure and the reference texture. However, this approach suffers from limited controllability for two reasons: conditioning on the raw reference image introduces unwanted structural information, and it fails to disentangle the visual texture and structure information of the source. To address this problem, we propose Refa\c{c}ade, a method that consists of two key designs to achieve precise and controllable texture transfer in both images and videos. First, we employ a texture remover trained on paired textured/untextured 3D mesh renderings to remove appearance information while preserving the geometry and motion of source videos. Second, we disrupt the reference global layout using a jigsaw permutation, encouraging the model to focus on local texture statistics rather than the global layout of the object. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, precise editing, and controllability, outperforming strong baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.

This study introduces a novel video-based facial sequence analysis approach dedicated to the detection of alcohol intoxication. The method integrates facial landmark analysis via a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with spatiotemporal visual features extracted using a 3D ResNet. These features are dynamically fused with adaptive prioritization to enhance classification performance. Additionally, we introduce a curated dataset comprising 3,542 video segments derived from 202 individuals to support training and evaluation. Our model is compared against two baselines: a custom 3D-CNN and a VGGFace+LSTM architecture. Experimental results show that our approach achieves 95.82% accuracy, 0.977 precision, and 0.97 recall, outperforming prior methods. The findings demonstrate the model's potential for practical deployment in public safety systems for non-invasive, reliable alcohol intoxication detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04540v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ultra long video understanding remains an open challenge, as existing vision language models (VLMs) falter on such content due to limited context length and inefficient long term memory retention. To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.

While recent models have shown impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel attack scenario that aims to forge document content in a visually imperceptible yet semantically targeted manner, allowing an adversary to induce specific or generally incorrect answers from a DocVQA model. We develop specialized attack algorithms that can produce adversarially forged documents tailored to different attackers' goals, ranging from targeted misinformation to systematic model failure scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against two end-to-end state-of-the-art models: Pix2Struct, a vision-language transformer that jointly processes image and text through sequence-to-sequence modeling, and Donut, a transformer-based model that directly extracts text and answers questions from document images. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current DocVQA systems and call for the development of more robust defenses.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04563v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning is crucial for enabling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand object properties and spatial relationships, yet current models still struggle with 3D-aware reasoning. Existing approaches typically enhance either perception, by augmenting RGB inputs with auxiliary modalities such as depth and segmentation, or reasoning, by training on spatial VQA datasets and applying reinforcement learning, and thus treat these two aspects in isolation. In this work, we investigate whether a unified MLLM can develop an intrinsic ability to enhance spatial perception and, through adaptive interleaved reasoning, achieve stronger spatial intelligence. We propose \textbf{COOPER}, a unified MLLM that leverages depth and segmentation as auxiliary modalities and is trained in two stages to acquire auxiliary modality generation and adaptive, interleaved reasoning capabilities. COOPER achieves an average \textbf{6.91\%} improvement in spatial reasoning while maintaining general performance. Moreover, even a variant trained only for auxiliary modality generation attains a \textbf{7.92\%} gain on distance and size estimation, suggesting that learning to generate auxiliary modalities helps internalize spatial knowledge and strengthen spatial understanding.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Supervised deep learning (DL) receives great interest for automated analysis of microscopic images with an increasing body of literature supporting its potential. The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. However, creating such datasets is a complex and resource-intensive process, often hindered by challenges such as time constraints, domain variability, and risks of bias in image collection and label creation. This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three "C"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research. By addressing the challenges and offering practical recommendations, this review aims to advance the creation of and availability to high-quality, large-scale datasets, ultimately contributing to the development of generalizable and robust DL models for pathology applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04568v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inspired by traditional handmade crafts, where a person improvises assemblies based on the available objects, we formally introduce the Craft Assembly Task. It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04576v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tumor segmentation and diagnosis in contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) rely heavily on the physiological dynamics of contrast agents. However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the "missing modality" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04581v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target tracking based on thermal infrared imaging has been one of the most important sensing technologies in anti-UAV applications. However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network. Extensive experiments on real infrared UAV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art target trackers under complex backgrounds while achieving a real-time tracking speed.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04585v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) has advanced open-vocabulary segmentation through promptable concept segmentation, allowing users to segment all instances corresponding to a given concept, typically specified with short noun-phrase (NP) prompts. While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04597v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires an agent to interpret language, perceive its environment, and navigate within 3D scenes to produce responses. Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting illicit visual content demands more than image-level NSFW flags; moderators must also know what objects make an image illegal and where those objects occur. We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks. The full pipeline processes an image in seconds, plugs seamlessly into existing VLM workflows, and constitutes the first practical tool for fine-grained, explainable malicious-image moderation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04619v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we introduce HeFT (Head-Frequency Tracker), a zero-shot point tracking framework that leverages the visual priors of pretrained video diffusion models. To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04643v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in video understanding. However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04660v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image editing models are advancing rapidly, yet comprehensive evaluation remains a significant challenge. Existing image editing benchmarks generally suffer from limited task scopes, insufficient evaluation dimensions, and heavy reliance on manual annotations, which significantly constrain their scalability and practical applicability. To address this, we propose \textbf{I2I-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for image-to-image editing models, which features (i) diverse tasks, encompassing 10 task categories across both single-image and multi-image editing tasks, (ii) comprehensive evaluation dimensions, including 30 decoupled and fine-grained evaluation dimensions with automated hybrid evaluation methods that integrate specialized tools and large multimodal models (LMMs), and (iii) rigorous alignment validation, justifying the consistency between our benchmark evaluations and human preferences. Using I2I-Bench, we benchmark numerous mainstream image editing models, investigating the gaps and trade-offs between editing models across various dimensions. We will open-source all components of I2I-Bench to facilitate future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient streaming video generation is critical for simulating interactive and dynamic worlds. Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04686v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-view correspondence is a fundamental capability for spatial understanding and embodied AI. However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of "perceive", "reason", and "correspond". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios. Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence. The benchmark, dataset, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/WangYipu2002/CrossPoint.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04699v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) overcomes the limitation of traditional super-resolution (SR) methods that operate only at fixed scales (e.g., 4x), enabling a single model to handle arbitrary magnification. Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors. Code will be released at https://github.com/chaixinning/OmniScaleSR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04728v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative psychological analysis of in-the-wild conversations faces two fundamental challenges: (1) existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail to resolve Articulatory-Affective Ambiguity, where visual patterns of speech mimic emotional expressions; and (2) progress is stifled by a lack of verifiable evaluation metrics capable of assessing visual grounding and reasoning depth. We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement. Second, we construct ConvoInsight-DB, a new large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro-expressions and deep psychological inference. Third, Third, we designed the Mental Reasoning Insight Rating Metric (PRISM), an automated dimensional framework that uses expert-guided LLM to measure the multidimensional performance of large mental vision models. On our PRISM benchmark, MIND significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving a +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our Status Judgment disentanglement module is the most critical component for this performance leap. Our code has been opened.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04733v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems increasingly adopt vision-language-action (VLA) models, yet they typically ignore the passenger's emotional state, which is central to comfort and AD acceptance. We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04734v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Depth completion plays a vital role in 3D perception systems, especially in scenarios where sparse depth data must be densified for tasks such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures. Our findings suggest that incorporating instance-aware cues offers a promising direction for improving depth completion without relying on dense semantic labels.

However, existing sketch-to-shape models ignore the temporal ordering of strokes, discarding crucial cues about structure and design intent. We introduce VRSketch2Shape, the first framework and multi-category dataset for generating 3D shapes from sequential VR sketches. Our contributions are threefold: (i) an automated pipeline that generates sequential VR sketches from arbitrary shapes, (ii) a dataset of over 20k synthetic and 900 hand-drawn sketch-shape pairs across four categories, and (iii) an order-aware sketch encoder coupled with a diffusion-based 3D generator. Our approach yields higher geometric fidelity than prior work, generalizes effectively from synthetic to real sketches with minimal supervision, and performs well even on partial sketches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Consistent image generation requires faithfully preserving identities, styles, and logical coherence across multiple images, which is essential for applications such as storytelling and character design. Supervised training approaches struggle with this task due to the lack of large-scale datasets capturing visual consistency and the complexity of modeling human perceptual preferences. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling models to learn complex and subjective visual criteria in a data-free manner. To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability. Together, these results highlight the promise of PaCo-RL as a practical and scalable solution for consistent image generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04786v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, seamless textures directly on 3D surfaces, what we term 3D-native texturing, remains a fundamental open challenge, with the potential to overcome long-standing limitations of UV-based and multi-view projection methods. However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04810v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose EMMA, an efficient and unified architecture for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Specifically, EMMA primarily consists of 1) An efficient autoencoder with a 32x compression ratio, which significantly reduces the number of tokens required for generation. This also ensures the training balance between understanding and generation tasks by applying the same compression ratio to images. 2) Channel-wise concatenation instead of token-wise concatenation among visual understanding and generation tokens, which further reduces the visual tokens in unified architectures. 3) A shared-and-decoupled network that enables mutual improvements across tasks while meeting the task-specific modeling requirements. 4) A mixture-of-experts mechanism adopted for visual understanding encoder, which substantially improves perceptual capabilities with a few parameters increase. Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04815v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Third, we incorporate the delayed Gaussian growth strategy and mask bootstrapping with appearance modeling to handling in-the-wild scenes including transients and illuminations. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable progress with the emergence of flow matching (FM). It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04830v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Closed-loop simulation and scalable pre-training for autonomous driving require synthesizing free-viewpoint driving scenes. However, existing datasets and generative pipelines rarely provide consistent off-trajectory observations, limiting large-scale evaluation and training. While recent generative models demonstrate strong visual realism, they struggle to jointly achieve interpolation consistency and extrapolation realism without per-scene optimization. To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints. Through co-training, generative priors are distilled into the reconstruction model to improve off-trajectory rendering, and the refined geometry in turn offers stronger structural guidance for generation. Experiments demonstrate that FreeGen achieves state-of-the-art performance for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Small Building Model (SBM), a Transformer-based architecture for layout synthesis in Building Information Modeling (BIM) scenes. We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing methods for deepfake detection aim to develop generalizable detectors. Although "generalizable" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT). Experiments demonstrate our superiority in predicting real-fake under the MID-FFD scenario while maintaining original generalization ability to unseen data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Capturing accurate 3D human pose in the wild would provide valuable data for training pose estimation and motion generation methods. While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated lesion detection in chest X-rays has demonstrated significant potential for improving clinical diagnosis by precisely localizing pathological abnormalities. While recent promptable detection frameworks have achieved remarkable accuracy in target localization, existing methods typically rely on manual annotations as prompts, which are labor-intensive and impractical for clinical applications. To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time tracking of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on edge devices faces a fundamental resolution-speed conflict. Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints. Experiments on a ground-to-air tracking station demonstrate that SDG-Track achieves 35.1 FPS system throughput while retaining 97.2\% of the frame-by-frame detection precision. The system successfully tracks agile FPV drones under real-world operational conditions on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Our paper code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jeffry-wen/SDG-Track

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04890v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present E(3)-Pose, a novel fast pose estimation method that jointly and explicitly models rotation equivariance and object symmetry. Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, paving the way for clinical translation. Our implementation is available at github.com/ramyamut/E3-Pose.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04904v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite tremendous recent progress, Flow Matching methods still suffer from exposure bias due to discrepancies in training and inference. This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04926v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) inherently follow a coarse-to-fine generation process, where high-level semantic structure is generated slightly earlier than fine-grained texture. This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling. Project page and code: https://yuemingpan.github.io/SFD.github.io/.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04927v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Herculaneum Papyri are a collection of rolled papyrus documents that were charred and buried by the famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius. They promise to contain a wealth of previously unseen Greek and Latin texts, but are extremely fragile and thus most cannot be unrolled physically. A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan. We conduct comprehensive experiments on high-resolution CT scans of two scrolls, showing that our approach successfully unrolls large regions, and exceeds the performance of the only existing automated unrolling method suitable for this data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04939v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D vision foundation models like Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) have advanced greatly in geometric perception. However, it is time-consuming and memory-intensive for long sequences, limiting application to large-scale scenes beyond hundreds of images. To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains. Extensive experiments validate LiteVGGT's effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. Project page: https://garlicba.github.io/LiteVGGT/

Employing gating mechanisms for multimodal fusion, we aim to surpass limitations inherent in traditional unimodal recognition methods while exploring novel possibilities for diverse applications. Through an exhaustive investigation of gating mechanisms and adaptive weighting-based fusion architectures, our methodology enables the selective integration of relevant information from various modalities, thereby bolstering both accuracy and robustness in action recognition tasks. We meticulously examine various gated fusion strategies to pinpoint the most effective approach for multimodal action recognition, showcasing its superiority over conventional unimodal methods. Gating mechanisms facilitate the extraction of pivotal features, resulting in a more holistic representation of actions and substantial enhancements in recognition performance. Our evaluations across human action recognition, violence action detection, and multiple self-supervised learning tasks on benchmark datasets demonstrate promising advancements in accuracy. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize action recognition systems across diverse fields. The fusion of multimodal information promises sophisticated applications in surveillance and human-computer interaction, especially in contexts related to active assisted living.

However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard Vision Transformers flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, disrupting the natural spatial topology. While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04967v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rich feature representations derived from CLIP-ViT have been widely utilized in AI-generated image detection. While most existing methods primarily leverage features from the final layer, we systematically analyze the contributions of layer-wise features to this task. Our study reveals that earlier layers provide more localized and generalizable features, often surpassing the performance of final-layer features in detection tasks. Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and versatility of our approach by successfully applying it to other pre-trained ViTs, such as DINOv2.

In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems.

VANICP is a recently published acceleration framework that significantly improves the computational efficiency of point-cloud-based applications. By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-transformer (DiT) framework for single-image reflection removal that leverages the generalization strengths of foundation diffusion models in the restoration setting. Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05006v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The perception of transparent objects is one of the well-known challenges in computer vision. Conventional depth sensors have difficulty in sensing the depth of transparent objects due to refraction and reflection of light. Previous research has typically train a neural network to complete the depth acquired by the sensor, and this method can quickly and accurately acquire accurate depth maps of transparent objects. However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new self-supervised method for training depth completion networks. Our method simulates the depth deficits of transparent objects within non-transparent regions and utilizes the original depth map as ground truth for supervision. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to supervised approach, and pre-training with our method can improve the model performance when the training samples are small.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition remains challenging due to the limited data, high writing style variance, and scripts with complex diacritics. Existing approaches, though partially address these issues, often struggle to generalize without massive synthetic data. To address these challenges, we propose HTR-ConvText, a model designed to capture fine-grained, stroke-level local features while preserving global contextual dependencies. In the feature extraction stage, we integrate a residual Convolutional Neural Network backbone with a MobileViT with Positional Encoding block. This enables the model to both capture structural patterns and learn subtle writing details. We then introduce the ConvText encoder, a hybrid architecture combining global context and local features within a hierarchical structure that reduces sequence length for improved efficiency. Additionally, an auxiliary module injects textual context to mitigate the weakness of Connectionist Temporal Classification. Evaluations on IAM, READ2016, LAM and HANDS-VNOnDB demonstrate that our approach achieves improved performance and better generalization compared to existing methods, especially in scenarios with limited training samples and high handwriting diversity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05025v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data spans a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, from high-resolution optical imagery to low resolution multispectral products or radar time series. While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Facial Image inpainting aim is to restore the missing or corrupted regions in face images while preserving identity, structural consistency and photorealistic image quality, a task specifically created for photo restoration. Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training. Experiment on two datasets CelebA-HQ and FFHQ shows that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM. It produces visually striking results with better semantic preservation, in challenging large-area inpainting situations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05044v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating interactive and dynamic 4D scenes from a single static image remains a core challenge. Most existing generate-then-reconstruct and reconstruct-then-generate methods decouple geometry from motion, causing spatiotemporal inconsistencies and poor generalization. To address these, we extend the reconstruct-then-generate framework to jointly perform Motion generation and geometric Reconstruction for 4D Synthesis (MoRe4D). We first introduce TrajScene-60K, a large-scale dataset of 60,000 video samples with dense point trajectories, addressing the scarcity of high-quality 4D scene data. Based on this, we propose a diffusion-based 4D Scene Trajectory Generator (4D-STraG) to jointly generate geometrically consistent and motion-plausible 4D point trajectories. To leverage single-view priors, we design a depth-guided motion normalization strategy and a motion-aware module for effective geometry and dynamics integration. We then propose a 4D View Synthesis Module (4D-ViSM) to render videos with arbitrary camera trajectories from 4D point track representations. Experiments show that MoRe4D generates high-quality 4D scenes with multi-view consistency and rich dynamic details from a single image. Code: https://github.com/Zhangyr2022/MoRe4D.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Constructing 4D language fields is crucial for embodied AI, augmented/virtual reality, and 4D scene understanding, as they provide enriched semantic representations of dynamic environments and enable open-vocabulary querying in complex scenarios. However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05076v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emerging video diffusion models achieve high visual fidelity but fundamentally couple scene dynamics with camera motion, limiting their ability to provide precise spatial and temporal control. We introduce a 4D-controllable video diffusion framework that explicitly decouples scene dynamics from camera pose, enabling fine-grained manipulation of both scene dynamics and camera viewpoint. Our framework takes continuous world-time sequences and camera trajectories as conditioning inputs, injecting them into the video diffusion model through a 4D positional encoding in the attention layer and adaptive normalizations for feature modulation. To train this model, we curate a unique dataset in which temporal and camera variations are independently parameterized; this dataset will be made public. Experiments show that our model achieves robust real-world 4D control across diverse timing patterns and camera trajectories, while preserving high generation quality and outperforming prior work in controllability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05079v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Object geometry is key information for robot manipulation. Yet, object reconstruction is a challenging task because cameras only capture partial observations of objects, especially when occlusion occurs. In this paper, we leverage two extra sources of information to reduce the ambiguity of vision signals. First, generative models learn priors of the shapes of commonly seen objects, allowing us to make reasonable guesses of the unseen part of geometry. Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05081v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive video diffusion have enabled real-time frame streaming, yet existing solutions still suffer from temporal repetition, drift, and motion deceleration. We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05091v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance on tasks such as visual grounding and visual question answering. However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k achieve substantial improvements in tracing the reasoning path.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05098v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) for AI-generated images (AIGI) has advanced rapidly; however, existing methods primarily target portraits and artistic images, lacking a systematic evaluation of interior scenes. We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation. Code and dataset will be open-sourced to advance research and applications in this domain.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05104v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) tasks often involve diverse degradation that require robust and versatile strategies. However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05106v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion {\phi}-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. {\phi}-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, {\phi}-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, {\phi}-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling.

We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05112v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05115v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04125v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated several emergent behaviors with scale, including reasoning and fluency in long-form text generation. However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A. Our work might potentially provide a principled step toward more powerful decoding methods for LLDMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04138v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data quality monitoring is a core challenge in modern information processing systems. While many approaches to detect data errors or shifts have been proposed, few studies investigate the mechanisms governing error generation. We argue that knowing how errors were generated can be key to tracing and fixing them. In this study, we build on existing work in the statistics literature on missing values and propose MechDetect, a simple algorithm to investigate error generation mechanisms. Given a tabular data set and a corresponding error mask, the algorithm estimates whether or not the errors depend on the data using machine learning models. Our work extends established approaches to detect mechanisms underlying missing values and can be readily applied to other error types, provided that an error mask is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MechDetect in experiments on established benchmark datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04165v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Two pressing topics in the theory of deep learning are the interpretation of feature learning mechanisms and the determination of implicit bias of networks in the rich regime. Current theories of rich feature learning effects revolve around networks with one or two trainable layers or deep linear networks. Furthermore, even under such limiting settings, predictions often appear in the form of high-dimensional non-linear equations, which require computationally intensive numerical solutions. Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge. Here, we propose a powerful heuristic route for predicting the data and width scales at which various patterns of feature learning emerge. This form of scale analysis is considerably simpler than such exact theories and reproduces the scaling exponents of various known results. In addition, we make novel predictions on complex toy architectures, such as three-layer non-linear networks and attention heads, thus extending the scope of first-principle theories of deep learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), which constrain both weights and activations to binary values, offer substantial reductions in computational complexity, memory footprint, and energy consumption. These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively. The proposed algorithm is released as an open-source repository.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A standard assumption in deep learning is that the inductive bias introduced by a neural network architecture must persist from training through inference. The architecture you train with is the architecture you deploy. This assumption constrains the community from selecting architectures that may have desirable efficiency or design properties due to difficulties with optimization. We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network. By decoupling optimization from deployment, NoT expands the space of viable inference-time architectures, opening opportunities for better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs and enabling more directed exploration of the architectural design space.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modelling the complexity and diversity of human activity scheduling behaviour is inherently challenging. We demonstrate a deep conditional-generative machine learning approach for the modelling of realistic activity schedules depending on input labels such as an individual's age, employment status, or other information relevant to their scheduling. We combine (i) a structured latent generative approach, with (ii) a conditional approach, through a novel Conditional VAE architecture. This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels. This comparison highlights the usefulness of explicitly modelling the randomness of complex and diverse human behaviours using deep generative approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04252v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting the inhibitory potency of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1)-a key target in overcoming cancer chemoresistance-remains a critical challenge in early drug discovery. We present a deep learning framework for the quantitative regression of pIC50 values from molecular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using fine-tuned variants of ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model. Leveraging a large-scale consensus dataset of 177,092 compounds, we systematically evaluate two pre-training strategies-Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Token Regression (MTR)-under stratified data splits and sample weighting to address severe activity imbalance which only 2.1% are active. Our approach outperforms classical baselines Random Predictor in both regression accuracy and virtual screening utility, and has competitive performance compared to Random Forest, achieving high enrichment factor EF@1% 17.4 and precision Precision@1% 37.4 among top-ranked predictions. The resulting model, validated through rigorous ablation and hyperparameter studies, provides a robust, ready-to-deploy tool for prioritizing TDP1 inhibitors for experimental testing. By enabling accurate, 3D-structure-free pIC50 prediction directly from SMILES, this work demonstrates the transformative potential of chemical transformers in accelerating target-specific drug discovery.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Adversarial training is an effective method to improve the machine learning (ML) model robustness. Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) is a striking phenomenon, yet its underlying mechanisms remain only partially understood. Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD. Finally, inspired by our findings in the case of linear regression, we consider widespread LLMs augmented with initial guess capabilities, and show that their performance is improved on a semantic similarity task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04277v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) typically optimizes a single scalar objective and ignores structure in how solutions are produced. We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04299v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spectral gradient methods, such as the recently popularized Muon optimizer, are a promising alternative to standard Euclidean gradient descent for training deep neural networks and transformers, but it is still unclear in which regimes they are expected to perform better. We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios. Together, these results identify conditions for spectral gradient methods, such as Muon, to be effective in training deep networks and transformers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As large language model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly integrated into daily digital interactions, their ability to reason across long interaction histories becomes crucial for providing personalized and contextually aware assistance. However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04310v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04332v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aligning generative diffusion models with human preferences via reinforcement learning (RL) is critical yet challenging. Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early detection of cancer plays a key role in improving survival rates, but identifying reliable biomarkers from RNA-seq data is still a major challenge. The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation. These results suggest that RGE-GCN shows promise as a generalizable approach for RNA-seq based early cancer detection and biomarker discovery (https://rce-gcn.streamlit.app/ ).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04341v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Popular offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on conservatism, either by penalizing out-of-dataset actions or by restricting planning horizons. In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief. Finally, we characterize when Neubay is preferable to conservatism, laying the foundation for a new direction in offline and model-based RL.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04351v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting when large language models (LLMs) are uncertain is critical for building reliable systems, yet existing methods are overly complicated, relying on brittle semantic clustering or internal states. We introduce \textbf{Radial Dispersion Score (RDS)}, a simple, parameter-free, fully model-agnostic uncertainty metric that measures the radial dispersion of sampled generations in embedding space. A lightweight probability-weighted variant further incorporates the model's own token probabilities when available, outperforming different nine strong baselines. Moroever, RDS naturally extends to per-sample scoring, enabling applications such as best-of-$N$ selection and confidence-based filtering. Across four challenging free-form QA datasets and multiple LLMs, our metrics achieve state-of-the-art hallucination detection and answer selection performance, while remaining robust and scalable with respect to sample size and embedding choice.

Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-grained air pollution forecasting is crucial for urban management and the development of healthy buildings. Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Powerful large language models (LLMs) from different providers have been expensively trained and finetuned to specialize across varying domains. In this work, we introduce a new kind of Conductor model trained with reinforcement learning to automatically discover powerful coordination strategies among LLMs. Our Conductor learns not only to design targeted communication topologies for effective agent-to-agent collaboration, but also to prompt engineer focused instructions to the LLMs to maximally leverage their individual capabilities. We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04464v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We challenge the common belief that deep learning always trumps older techniques, using the example of grading Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle gold coins automatically. In our work, we put a feature-based Artificial Neural Network built around 192 custom features pulled from Sobel edge detection and HSV color analysis up against a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network that blends in EfficientNetV2, plus a straightforward Support Vector Machine as the control. Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups. This rings true for other niche quality checks where data's thin and know-how matters more than raw compute.

However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models through conditional computation, but inference becomes memory-bound once expert weights exceed the capacity of GPU memory. In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, enabling effective retrieval while mitigating domain discrepancies. However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an important area in the AI community, and interpretability is crucial for building robust and trustworthy AI models. While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis. Additionally, we compare our method against multiple baselines in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04558v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Test-time compute (TTC) has become an increasingly prominent paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs). Despite the empirical success of methods such as best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling and sequential revision, their fundamental limits remain unclear. We address this gap by analyzing a mixture-of-reference policy model and proving that standard BoN is inherently suboptimal. To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones. On the theoretical side, we show that reward-filtered sequential inference yields strictly stronger guarantees than standard TTC paradigms. On the empirical side, we evaluate such an inference strategy across diverse benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over widely used approaches, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-likelihood samples but often require alignment with downstream objectives. Existing fine-tuning methods for diffusion models significantly suffer from reward over-optimization, resulting in high-reward but unnatural samples and degraded diversity. To mitigate over-optimization, we propose \textbf{Soft Q-based Diffusion Finetuning (SQDF)}, a novel KL-regularized RL method for diffusion alignment that applies a reparameterized policy gradient of a training-free, differentiable estimation of the soft Q-function. SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment. Furthermore, in online black-box optimization, SQDF attains high sample efficiency while maintaining naturalness and diversity.

Yet, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks makes it challenging to evaluate, compare, and further develop these ML models meaningfully. In this work, we introduce LeMat-GenBench, a unified benchmark for generative models of crystalline materials, supported by a set of evaluation metrics designed to better inform model development and downstream applications. We release both an open-source evaluation suite and a public leaderboard on Hugging Face, and benchmark 12 recent generative models. Results reveal that an increase in stability leads to a decrease in novelty and diversity on average, with no model excelling across all dimensions. Altogether, LeMat-GenBench establishes a reproducible and extensible foundation for fair model comparison and aims to guide the development of more reliable, discovery-oriented generative models for crystalline materials.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04566v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Surrogate models (including deep neural networks and other machine learning algorithms in supervised learning) are capable of approximating arbitrarily complex, high-dimensional input-output problems in science and engineering, but require a thorough data-agnostic uncertainty quantification analysis before these can be deployed for any safety-critical application. The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-world learning (OWL) requires models that can adapt to evolving environments while reliably detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Existing approaches, such as SCONE, achieve robustness to covariate and semantic shifts but assume static environments, leading to degraded performance in dynamic domains. In this paper, we propose Temp-SCONE, a temporally consistent extension of SCONE designed to handle temporal shifts in dynamic environments. Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization. Our theoretical insights on temporal stability and generalization error further establish Temp-SCONE as a step toward reliable OWL in evolving dynamic environments.

Experiments on a real world encryption detection task demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed features across several learning algorithms. The learner faces the problem of detecting encryption activities across a large dataset of files, using function call traces and graph based features. Empirical results highlight an outstanding accuracy of 99.28 on the task at hand, underscoring the efficacy of features derived from the function graph tracer. The results were further validated in an additional experiment targeting a multilabel classification problem, in which running programs were identified from trace data. This work provides comprehensive methodologies for preprocessing raw trace data and extracting graph based features, offering significant advancements in applying ML to system behavior analysis, program identification, and anomaly detection. By bridging the gap between system tracing and ML, this paper paves the way for innovative solutions in performance monitoring and security analytics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04596v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is fundamental to service computing, providing essential data-driven guidance for service selection and ensuring superior user experiences. However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against data sparsity and observational noise.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people. In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Score matching estimators have garnered significant attention in recent years because they eliminate the need to compute normalizing constants, thereby mitigating the computational challenges associated with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).While several studies have proposed score matching estimators for point processes, this work highlights the limitations of these existing methods, which stem primarily from the lack of a mathematically rigorous analysis of how score matching behaves on finite point processes -- special random configurations on bounded spaces where many of the usual assumptions and properties of score matching no longer hold. To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the history of knowledge distillation, the focus has once shifted over time from logit-based to feature-based approaches. However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04644v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Earth observation (EO) models are frequently trained under implicit sampling policies that optimize global accuracy but provide no explicit guarantees on who (which regions, classes, or mission-critical strata) is being served throughout training. This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement.

This requires models that can represent the influence of local site conditions on ground motion characteristics. In this context, data driven approaches that learn site controlled signatures from recorded ground motions offer a promising direction. We address strong ground motion generation from time-domain accelerometer records and introduce the TimesNet-Gen, a time-domain conditional generator. The approach uses a station specific latent bottleneck. We evaluate generation by comparing HVSR curves and fundamental site-frequency $f_0$ distributions between real and generated records per station, and summarize station specificity with a score based on the $f_0$ distribution confusion matrices. TimesNet-Gen achieves strong station-wise alignment and compares favorably with a spectrogram-based conditional VAE baseline for site-specific strong motion synthesis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Combining diverse foundation models is promising, but weight-merging is limited by mismatched architectures and closed APIs. Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04703v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient optimization algorithms using epochs, that is those based on stochastic gradient descent without replacement (SGDo), are predominantly used to train machine learning models in practice. However, the mathematical theory of SGDo and related algorithms remain underexplored compared to their "with replacement" and "one-pass" counterparts. In this article, we propose a stochastic, continuous-time approximation to SGDo with additive noise based on a Young differential equation driven by a stochastic process we call an "epoched Brownian motion". We show its usefulness by proving the almost sure convergence of the continuous-time approximation for strongly convex objectives and learning rate schedules of the form $u_t = \frac{1}{(1+t)^\beta}, \beta \in (0,1)$. Moreover, we compute an upper bound on the asymptotic rate of almost sure convergence, which is as good or better than previous results for SGDo.

The lecture notes systematically introduce the fundamental concepts, modeling components, and theoretical foundations of regression analysis, covering linear regression, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, polynomial regression, basis-function models, kernel-based methods, and neural-network-based nonlinear regression. Core methodological topics include loss-function design, parameter-estimation principles, ordinary least squares, gradient-based optimization algorithms and their variants, as well as regularization techniques such as Ridge and LASSO regression. Through detailed mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and intuitive visual explanations, the materials help students understand not only how regression models are constructed and optimized, but also how they reveal the underlying relationships between features and response variables. By bridging classical statistical modeling and modern machine-learning practice, these lecture notes aim to equip students with a solid conceptual and technical foundation for further study in advanced artificial intelligence models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04752v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an important fine-tuning technique for large language models (LLMs) and comprises three stages: generation, inference, and training. The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works. Moreover, due to the effective alleviation of the generation bottleneck, RLHFSpec also shows significant performance speedup in the entire RLHF execution.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context. Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04912v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In general, approximating classes of functions defined over high-dimensional input spaces by linear combinations of a fixed set of basis functions or ``features'' is known to be hard. Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $\Theta\(n^{-1/d}\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core. Hence, using standard results we obtain upper bounds on the approximation rate of neural network classes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04918v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Intraday surgical scheduling is a multi-objective decision problem under uncertainty-balancing elective throughput, urgent and emergency demand, delays, sequence-dependent setups, and overtime. We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions. We discuss limitations-including OR homogeneity and the omission of explicit staffing constraints-and outline extensions. Overall, the approach offers a practical, interpretable, and tunable data-driven complement to optimization for real-time OR scheduling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04949v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agents capable of accomplishing complex tasks through multiple interactions with the environment have emerged as a popular research direction. However, in such multi-step settings, the conventional group-level policy optimization algorithm becomes suboptimal because of its underlying assumption that each action holds equal contribution, which deviates significantly from reality. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for multi-step agents. CARL achieves focused training through providing action-level optimization signals for high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL achieves both stronger performance and higher efficiency during training and inference across diverse evaluation settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04954v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04958v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The main focus of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is studying how large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be more efficiently solved when addressed in a modular way, by combining partial solutions computed for smaller subtasks. Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04974v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce ECHO, a transformer-operator framework for generating million-point PDE trajectories. While existing neural operators (NOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations, they remain limited in practice due to poor scalability on dense grids, error accumulation during dynamic unrolling, and task-specific design. ECHO addresses these challenges through three key innovations. (i) It employs a hierarchical convolutional encode-decode architecture that achieves a 100 $\times$ spatio-temporal compression while preserving fidelity on mesh points. (ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on million-point simulations across diverse PDE systems featuring complex geometries, high-frequency dynamics, and long-term horizons.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05030v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Concept vectors aim to enhance model interpretability by linking internal representations with human-understandable semantics, but their utility is often limited by noisy and inconsistent activations. In this work, we uncover a clear pattern within the noise, which we term the SuperActivator Mechanism: while in-concept and out-of-concept activations overlap considerably, the token activations in the extreme high tail of the in-concept distribution provide a reliable signal of concept presence. We demonstrate the generality of this mechanism by showing that SuperActivator tokens consistently outperform standard vector-based and prompting concept detection approaches, achieving up to a 14% higher F1 score across image and text modalities, model architectures, model layers, and concept extraction techniques. Finally, we leverage SuperActivator tokens to improve feature attributions for concepts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05066v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As healthcare increasingly turns to AI for scalable and trustworthy clinical decision support, ensuring reliability in model reasoning remains a critical challenge. Individual large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistency, whereas naive ensembles of models often fail to deliver stable and credible recommendations. Building on our previous work on LLM Chemistry, which quantifies the collaborative compatibility among LLMs, we apply this framework to improve the reliability in medication recommendation from brief clinical vignettes. Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations. Preliminary results are encouraging, suggesting that LLM Chemistry-guided collaboration may offer a promising path toward reliable and trustworthy AI assistants in clinical practice.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly-based intrusion detection requires models that can generalize to attack patterns not observed during training. This work presents the first large-scale evaluation of hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) autoencoders for this task. We construct a unified experimental framework that iterates over key quantum design choices, including quantum-layer placement, measurement approach, variational and non-variational formulations, and latent-space regularization. Experiments across three benchmark NIDS datasets show that HQC autoencoders can match or exceed classical performance in their best configurations, although they exhibit higher sensitivity to architectural decisions. Under zero-day evaluation, well-configured HQC models provide stronger and more stable generalization than classical and supervised baselines. Simulated gate-noise experiments reveal early performance degradation, indicating the need for noise-aware HQC designs. These results provide the first data-driven characterization of HQC autoencoder behavior for network intrusion detection and outline key factors that govern their practical viability.

As foundation models keep scaling, we ask: Is bigger always better for hardware design? Our work tests this by evaluating Small Language Models coupled with a curated agentic AI framework on NVIDIA's Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems(CVDP) benchmark. Results show that agentic workflows: through task decomposition, iterative feedback, and correction - not only unlock near-LLM performance at a fraction of the cost but also create learning opportunities for agents, paving the way for efficient, adaptive solutions in complex design tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05080v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) focuses on designing small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows. Additionally, we curate a dataset of 500M 3D molecular conformers, complementing protein-ligand data and expanding the chemical diversity available for training. OMTRA obtains state of the art performance on pocket-conditioned de novo design and docking; however, the effects of large-scale pretraining and multi-task training are modest.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05084v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Gradient-based iterative optimization methods are the workhorse of modern machine learning. They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector. Our approach can be used to bound the sample complexity for minimizing both the validation loss as well as the number of gradient descent iterations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world physical processes do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact and low-variability subsets of functional space. This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems.   This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown.   We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals.   Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05116v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While methods exist for aligning flow matching models--a popular and effective class of generative models--with human preferences, existing approaches fail to achieve both adaptation efficiency and probabilistically sound prior preservation. In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03048v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03072v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03293v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities for social interaction and are increasingly being deployed in situations where they might engage with both human and artificial agents. These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03438v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic reasoning models trained with multimodal reinforcement learning (MMRL) have become increasingly capable, yet they are almost universally optimized using sparse, outcome-based rewards computed based on the final answers. Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Communication is one of the effective means to improve the learning of cooperative policy in multi-agent systems. However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03549v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce PARC, a coding agent for the autonomous and robust execution of long-horizon computational tasks. PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines. These results highlight the potential of integrating a hierarchical multi-agent system with self-assessment and self-feedback to enable AI systems capable of independent, large-scale scientific and analytical work.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03560v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite recent advances, autonomous agents often struggle to solve complex tasks in enterprise domains that require coordinating multiple tools and processing diverse data sources. This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03571v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03607v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.   Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03627v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large-scale language and vision models, AI agents still suffer from a fundamental limitation: they cannot remember. Without reliable memory, agents catastrophically forget past experiences, struggle with long-horizon reasoning, and fail to operate coherently in multimodal or interactive environments. We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03762v2 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03783v2 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03887v2 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement in Large Language Models has driven the creation of complex agentic systems, such as Deep Research Agents (DRAs), to overcome the limitations of static Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks. This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.   The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.   We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score. The Static-DRA offers a pragmatic and resource-aware solution, empowering users with transparent control over the deep research process.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.03931v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a logic programming-based framework for policy-aware autonomous agents that can reason about potential penalties for non-compliance and act accordingly. While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Assistive robots operating in unstructured environments must understand not only what objects are, but what they can be used for. This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems.

The approach starts with partial feedback linearization and stabilization. Then, transverse linearization along the reference orbit is computed, resulting in a periodic linear time-varying system with a stable subspace. Sliding-mode control drives trajectories toward this subspace. The proposed design avoids solving computationally intensive periodic LQR problems and improves robustness to matched disturbances.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study how to exploit dense simulator-defined rewards in vision-based autonomous driving without inheriting their misalignment with deployment metrics. In realistic simulators such as CARLA, privileged state (e.g., lane geometry, infractions, time-to-collision) can be converted into dense rewards that stabilize and accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, but policies trained directly on these signals often overfit and fail to generalize when evaluated on sparse objectives such as route completion and collision-free overtaking. We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping. These results show that dense rewards can be leveraged to learn richer dynamics models while keeping the deployed policy optimized strictly for sparse, deployment-aligned objectives.

These models have shown strong potential in generalization and reasoning, but achieving reliable and responsible robotic behavior in real-world settings remains an open challenge. In high-stakes environments, robotic agents must go beyond basic task execution to perform risk-aware reasoning, moral decision-making, and physically grounded planning. We introduce ResponsibleRobotBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate and accelerate progress in responsible robotic manipulation from simulation to real world. This benchmark consists of 23 multi-stage tasks spanning diverse risk types, including electrical, chemical, and human-related hazards, and varying levels of physical and planning complexity. These tasks require agents to detect and mitigate risks, reason about safety, plan sequences of actions, and engage human assistance when necessary. Our benchmark includes a general-purpose evaluation framework that supports multimodal model-based agents with various action representation modalities. The framework integrates visual perception, context learning, prompt construction, hazard detection, reasoning and planning, and physical execution. It also provides a rich multimodal dataset, supports reproducible experiments, and includes standardized metrics such as success rate, safety rate, and safe success rate. Through extensive experimental setups, ResponsibleRobotBench enables analysis across risk categories, task types, and agent configurations. By emphasizing physical reliability, generalization, and safety in decision-making, this benchmark provides a foundation for advancing the development of trustworthy, real-world responsible dexterous robotic systems. https://sites.google.com/view/responsible-robotbench

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04373v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous landing on sloped terrain poses significant challenges for small, lightweight spacecraft, such as rotorcraft and landers. These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain. Overall, the method offers a robust, low-resource landing strategy that enhances the feasibility of autonomous planetary missions with small spacecraft.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present FoundAtion-model-guided decoupled LoCO-maNipulation visuomotor policies (FALCON), a framework for loco-manipulation that combines modular diffusion policies with a vision-language foundation model as the coordinator. Our approach explicitly decouples locomotion and manipulation into two specialized visuomotor policies, allowing each subsystem to rely on its own observations. This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions. We evaluate FALCON on two challenging loco-manipulation tasks requiring navigation, precise end-effector placement, and tight base-arm coordination. Results show that it surpasses centralized and decentralized baselines while exhibiting improved robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In robotic hand research, minimizing the number of actuators while maintaining human-hand-consistent dimensions and degrees of freedom constitutes a fundamental challenge. Drawing bio-inspiration from human hand kinematic configurations and muscle distribution strategies, this work proposes a novel 15-DoF dexterous robotic hand, with detailed analysis of its mechanical architecture, electrical system, and control system. The bionic hand employs a new tendon-driven mechanism, significantly reducing the number of motors required by traditional tendon-driven systems while enhancing motion performance and simplifying the mechanical structure. This design integrates five motors in the forearm to provide strong gripping force, while ten small motors are installed in the palm to support fine manipulation tasks. Additionally, a corresponding joint sensing and motor driving electrical system was developed to ensure efficient control and feedback. The entire system weighs only 1.4kg, combining lightweight and high-performance features. Through experiments, the bionic hand exhibited exceptional dexterity and robust grasping capabilities, demonstrating significant potential for robotic manipulation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04404v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes an Interactive Inference Behavior Tree (IIBT) framework that integrates behavior trees (BTs) with active inference under the free energy principle for distributed multi-robot decision-making. The proposed IIBT node extends conventional BTs with probabilistic reasoning, enabling online joint planning and execution across multiple robots. It remains fully com- patible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observ- able and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative ma- nipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4). Experimental results demonstrate that the IIBT framework reduces BT node complexity by over 70%, while maintaining robust, interpretable, and adaptive cooperative behavior under environmental uncertainty.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Physical feasibility in 3D bin packing is a key requirement in modern industrial logistics and robotic automation. With the growing adoption of industrial automation, online bin packing has gained increasing attention. However, inconsistencies in problem settings, test datasets, and evaluation metrics have hindered progress in the field, and there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system. Direct testing on real hardware is costly, and building a realistic simulation environment is also challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility. In our simulation environment, we introduce a robotic arm and boxes at real-world scales to replicate real industrial packing workflows. By simulating conditions that arise in real industrial applications, we ensure that evaluated algorithms are practically deployable. In addition, prior studies often rely on synthetic datasets whose distributions differ from real-world industrial data. To address this issue, we collect three datasets from real industrial workflows, including assembly-line production, logistics packing, and furniture manufacturing. The benchmark comprises three carefully designed test settings and extends existing evaluation metrics with new metrics for structural stability and operational safety. We design a scoring system and derive a range of insights from the evaluation results. RoboBPP is fully open-source and is equipped with visualization tools and an online leaderboard, providing a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research and industrial applications (https://robot-bin-packing-benchmark.github.io).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04446v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automating disassembly of critical components from end-of-life (EoL) desktops, such as high-value items like RAM modules and CPUs, as well as sensitive parts like hard disk drives, remains challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these products. Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04453v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To collaborate with humans, robots must infer goals that are often ambiguous, difficult to articulate, or not drawn from a fixed set. Prior approaches restrict inference to a predefined goal set, rely only on observed actions, or depend exclusively on explicit instructions, making them brittle in real-world interactions. We present BALI (Bidirectional Action-Language Inference) for goal prediction, a method that integrates natural language preferences with observed human actions in a receding-horizon planning tree. BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals. We evaluate the approach in collaborative cooking tasks, where goals may be novel to the robot and unbounded. Compared to baselines, BALI yields more stable goal predictions and significantly fewer mistakes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04502v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensemble control aims to steer a population of dynamical systems using a shared control input. This paper introduces a constrained ensemble control framework for parameterized, heterogeneous robotic systems operating under state and environmental constraints, such as obstacle avoidance. We develop a moment kernel transform that maps the parameterized ensemble dynamics to the moment system in a kernel space, enabling the characterization of population-level behavior. The state-space constraints, such as polyhedral waypoints to be visited and obstacles to be avoided, are also transformed into the moment space, leading to a unified formulation for safe, large-scale ensemble control. Expressive signal temporal logic specifications are employed to encode complex visit-avoid tasks, which are achieved through a single shared controller synthesized from our constrained ensemble control formulation. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in safely and efficiently controlling robotic ensembles within constrained environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04731v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cross-domain transfer in robotic manipulation remains a longstanding challenge due to the significant domain gap between simulated and real-world environments. Existing methods such as domain randomization, adaptation, and sim-real calibration often require extensive tuning or fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment. Results demonstrate that S2GS significantly improves sim-to-real transferability, maintaining high and stable task performance in real-world scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04770v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04772v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, precision agriculture has been introducing groundbreaking innovations in the field, with a strong focus on automation. However, research studies in robotics and autonomous navigation often rely on controlled simulations or isolated field trials. The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields. The dataset, the processing tools and the benchmarking results will be available at the dedicated webpage upon acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drones are becoming indispensable in many application domains. In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x. Also, the achieved median mission time is very close, merely up to 2.7% higher, to that of a method with perfect knowledge of the current underlying event probability at each point of interest.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imitation learning method has shown immense promise for robotic manipulation, yet its practical deployment is fundamentally constrained by the data scarcity. Despite prior work on collecting large-scale datasets, there still remains a significant gap to robust spatial generalization. We identify a key limitation: individual trajectories, regardless of their length, are typically collected from a \emph{single, static spatial configuration} of the environment. This includes fixed object and target spatial positions as well as unchanging camera viewpoints, which significantly restricts the diversity of spatial information available for learning. To address this critical bottleneck in data efficiency, we propose \textbf{MOtion-Based Variability Enhancement} (\emph{MOVE}), a simple yet effective data collection paradigm that enables the acquisition of richer spatial information from dynamic demonstrations. Our core contribution is an augmentation strategy that injects motion into any movable objects within the environment for each demonstration. This process implicitly generates a dense and diverse set of spatial configurations within a single trajectory. We conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments to validate our approach. For example, in simulation tasks requiring strong spatial generalization, \emph{MOVE} achieves an average success rate of 39.1\%, a 76.1\% relative improvement over the static data collection paradigm (22.2\%), and yields up to 2--5$\times$ gains in data efficiency on certain tasks.

The dataset contains 3048 sequences across 381 articulated objects in 38 environments. Each object is operated under four embodiments - (i) human hand, (ii) human hand with a wrist-mounted camera, (iii) handheld UMI gripper, and (iv) a custom Hoi! gripper - where the tool embodiment provides synchronized end-effector forces and tactile sensing. Our dataset offers a holistic view of interaction understanding from video, enabling researchers to evaluate how well methods transfer between human and robotic viewpoints, but also investigate underexplored modalities such as force sensing and prediction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04917v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work investigates how disturbance-aware, robustness-embedded reference trajectories translate into driving performance when executed by professional drivers in a dynamic simulator. Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04960v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the fact that visuomotor-based policies obtained via imitation learning demonstrate good performances in complex manipulation tasks, they usually struggle to achieve the same accuracy and speed as traditional control based methods. In this work, we introduce Hybrid-Diffusion models that combine open-loop routines with visuomotor diffusion policies. We develop Teleoperation Augmentation Primitives (TAPs) that allow the operator to perform predefined routines, such as locking specific axes, moving to perching waypoints, or triggering task-specific routines seamlessly during demonstrations. Our Hybrid-Diffusion method learns to trigger such TAPs during inference. We validate the method on challenging real-world tasks: Vial Aspiration, Open-Container Liquid Transfer, and container unscrewing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04973v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Variable Stiffness Actuators prove invaluable for robotics applications in unstructured environments, fostering safe interactions and enhancing task adaptability. Nevertheless, their mechanical design inevitably results in larger and heavier structures compared to classical rigid actuators. This paper introduces a novel 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) parallel wrist that achieves variable stiffness through redundant elastic actuation. Leveraging its parallel architecture, the device employs only four motors, rendering it compact and lightweight. This characteristic makes it particularly well-suited for applications in prosthetics or humanoid robotics. The manuscript delves into the theoretical model of the device and proposes a sophisticated control strategy for independent regulation of joint position and stiffness. Furthermore, it validates the proposed controller through simulation, utilizing a comprehensive analysis of the system dynamics. The reported results affirm the ability of the device to achieve high accuracy and disturbance rejection in rigid configurations while minimizing interaction forces with its compliant behavior.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.04998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current upper limb prostheses aim to enhance user independence in daily activities by incorporating basic motor functions. However, they fall short of replicating the natural movement and interaction capabilities of the human arm. In contrast, human limbs leverage intrinsic compliance and actively modulate joint stiffness, enabling adaptive responses to varying tasks, impact absorption, and efficient energy transfer during dynamic actions. Inspired by this adaptability, we developed a transhumeral prosthesis with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) to replicate the controllable compliance found in biological joints. The proposed prosthesis features a modular design, allowing customization for different residual limb shapes and accommodating a range of independent control signals derived from users' biological cues. Integrated elastic elements passively support more natural movements, facilitate safe interactions with the environment, and adapt to diverse task requirements. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the platform and its functionalities, highlighting its potential applications in the field of prosthetics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05008v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This thesis presents a unified modeling and simulation framework for analyzing sidewinding and tumbling locomotion of the COBRA snake robot across rigid, compliant, and granular terrains. A contact-implicit formulation is used to model distributed frictional interactions during sidewinding, and validated through MATLAB Simscape simulations and physical experiments on rigid ground and loose sand. To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models. Together, these methods span real-time control-oriented simulation and high-fidelity granular physics. Results demonstrate that rigid-ground models provide accurate short-horizon motion prediction, while continuum and particle-based terrain modeling becomes necessary for reliable mobility analysis in soft and highly dynamic environments. This work establishes a hierarchical simulation pipeline that advances robust, terrain-aware locomotion for robots operating in challenging unstructured settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05094v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly improving in their ability to synthesize human actions in novel contexts, holding the potential to serve as high-level planners for contextual robot control. To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.05107v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.
