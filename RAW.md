- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07838v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cyberbullying is a well-known social issue, and it is escalating day by day. Due to the vigorous development of the internet, social media provide many different ways for the user to express their opinions and exchange information. Cyberbullying occurs on social media using text messages, comments, sharing images and GIFs or stickers, and audio and video. Much research has been done to detect cyberbullying on textual data; some are available for images. Very few studies are available to detect cyberbullying on GIFs/stickers. We collect a GIF dataset from Twitter and Applied a deep learning model to detect cyberbullying from the dataset. Firstly, we extracted hashtags related to cyberbullying using Twitter. We used these hashtags to download GIF file using publicly available API GIPHY. We collected over 4100 GIFs including cyberbullying and non cyberbullying. we applied deep learning pre-trained model VGG16 for the detection of the cyberbullying. The deep learning model achieved the accuracy of 97%. Our work provides the GIF dataset for researchers working in this area.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07925v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The challenges of ongoing war in Sudan highlight the need for rapid moni- toring and analysis of such conflicts. Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite remote sensing imagery allow for near real-time monitor- ing. This paper uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to show that fire damage in armed conflicts can be monitored with minimal delay. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five case studies in Sudan. We show that, compared to a baseline, the automated method captures the active fires and charred areas more accurately. Our re- sults indicate that using 8-band imagery or time series of such imagery only result in marginal gains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07951v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video face swapping is crucial in film and entertainment production, where achieving high fidelity and temporal consistency over long and complex video sequences remains a significant challenge. Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

- **标题**: Restrictive Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation for Stratified Tooth Layer Detection

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cartographic reasoning is the skill of interpreting geographic relationships by aligning legends, map scales, compass directions, map texts, and geometries across one or more map images. Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. These results reveal a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning, positioning FRIEDA as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress on spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks are frequently used in medical diagnosis. However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses. Additionally, SSplain identifies features that are consistent with domain-understandable features that clinicians consider as discriminative factors for ROP. We also show SSplain's generalization by applying it to additional publicly available datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/neu-spiral/SSplain.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Our aim is to develop a unified model for sign language understanding, that performs sign language translation (SLT) and sign-subtitle alignment (SSA). Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA. Our model also demonstrates robust zero-shot generalisation and finetuned SLT performance on How2Sign (ASL), highlighting the potential of scalable translation across different sign languages.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Universal deepfake detection aims to identify AI-generated images across a broad range of generative models, including unseen ones. This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08048v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Distribution shifts at test time degrade image classifiers. Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\ low vs.\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\%/19.8\%/39.2\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust. These results indicate that a simple random masking schedule, coupled with consistency and entropy objectives, is sufficient to drive effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The preservation of the Amazon Rainforest is one of the global priorities in combating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and safeguarding indigenous cultures. The Satellite-based Monitoring Project of Deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES), a project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), stands out as a fundamental initiative in this effort, annually monitoring deforested areas not only in the Amazon but also in other Brazilian biomes. Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem. However, existing approaches present significant limitations: models evaluated in the literature still show unsatisfactory effectiveness, many do not incorporate modern architectures, such as those based on self-attention mechanisms, and there is a lack of methodological standardization that allows direct comparisons between different studies. In this work, we address these gaps by evaluating various change detection models in a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and networks incorporating self-attention mechanisms based on Transformers. We investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques, such as filtering deforested areas predicted by the models based on the size of connected components, texture replacement, and image enhancements; we demonstrate that such approaches can significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Additionally, we test different strategies for combining the evaluated models to achieve results superior to those obtained individually, reaching an F1-score of 80.41%, a value comparable to other recent works in the literature.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a central-peripheral vision-inspired framework (CVP), a simple yet effective multimodal model for spatial reasoning that draws inspiration from the two types of human visual fields -- central vision and peripheral vision. Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08161v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image dehazing is crucial for reliable visual perception, yet it remains highly challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a fundamental capability for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08180v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-quality geometric diagram generation presents both a challenge and an opportunity: it demands strict spatial accuracy while offering well-defined constraints to guide generation. Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Camera-based animal re-identification (Animal Re-ID) can support wildlife monitoring and precision livestock management in large outdoor environments with limited wireless connectivity. In these settings, inference must run directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes built around microcontrollers (MCUs), yet most Animal Re-ID models are designed for workstations or servers and are too large for devices with small memory and low-resolution inputs. We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version. We demonstrate that practical, adaptable Animal Re-ID is achievable on MCU-class devices, paving the way for scalable deployment in real field environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The creation of lifelike human avatars capable of realistic pose variation and viewpoint flexibility remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity. We further enhance visual quality through hierarchical feature fusion, incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors extracted from parametric SMPL models to simultaneously improve global coherence and local detail accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Blur2Sharp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in both novel pose and view generation tasks, particularly excelling under challenging scenarios involving loose clothing and occlusions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08221v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, these models exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Through transfer learning techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning, they can be adapted to various downstream tasks with minimal parameter adjustments. This approach is particularly common in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper aims to explore the effectiveness of common prompt tuning methods in 3D object detection. We investigate whether a model trained on the large-scale Waymo dataset can serve as a foundation model and adapt to other scenarios within the 3D object detection field. This paper sequentially examines the impact of prompt tokens and prompt generators, and further proposes a Scene-Oriented Prompt Pool (\textbf{SOP$^2$}). We demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt pools in 3D object detection, with the goal of inspiring future researchers to delve deeper into the potential of prompts in the 3D field.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08227v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern video codecs have been extensively optimized to preserve perceptual quality, leveraging models of the human visual system. However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ability to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning marks a major milestone for multimodal models (MMs), enabling them to solve complex visual reasoning problems. Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08237v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of camera-only Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) perception is currently impeded by a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and on-vehicle deployment tractability. This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the "Deployable by Design" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is "Fast by Algorithm", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have transformed multimodal reasoning, but feeding hundreds of visual patch tokens into LLMs incurs quadratic computational costs, straining memory and context windows. Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show that the compressed token prioritizes the discrete anchor, validating its semantic guidance. Our work demonstrates that a minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advance scalable VLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08243v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A novel deep hybrid Residual-SwinCA-Net segmentation framework is proposed in the study for addressing such challenges by extracting locally correlated and robust features, incorporating residual CNN modules. Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework improves the BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and strengthens timely clinical decision-making.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08247v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-3DSeg) aims to segment novel classes with only a few labeled samples. However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08254v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scene recovery serves as a critical task for various computer vision applications. Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed SFP for scene recovery under various degradation conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08262v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of LiDAR, RADAR, and camera sensors is essential for reliable perception in autonomous vehicles. Still, it remains challenging due to factors such as mechanical vibrations and cumulative sensor drift in dynamic environments. This paper presents RLCNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep learning framework for the simultaneous online calibration of these multimodal sensors. Validated on real-world datasets, RLCNet is designed for practical deployment and demonstrates robust performance under diverse conditions. To support real-time operation, an online calibration framework is introduced that incorporates a weighted moving average and outlier rejection, enabling dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters with reduced prediction noise and improved resilience to drift. An ablation study highlights the significance of architectural choices, while comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08269v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Egocentric perception enables humans to experience and understand the world directly from their own point of view. Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality and temporal synchronization, yet most models remain appearance-driven, capturing visual-acoustic correlations without considering the physical factors that shape real-world sounds. We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08294v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the promising progress in subject-driven image generation, current models often deviate from the reference identities and struggle in complex scenes with multiple subjects. To address this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, a video-derived large-scale corpus with 2.5M samples and 4.35M images for subject-driven generation and manipulation. The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips. (ii) Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing. We utilize vision-language model (VLM)-based category consensus, local grounding, and diversity-aware pairing to select image pairs. (iii) Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis. We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion. (iv) Verification and Captioning. We utilize a VLM to validate synthesized samples, re-synthesize failed samples based on stage (iii), and then construct short and long captions. In addition, we introduce a benchmark covering subject-driven generation and manipulation, and then evaluate identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation consistency, and background consistency with a VLM judge. Extensive experiments show that training with OpenSubject improves generation and manipulation performance, particularly in complex scenes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08317v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact subset of the original data, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large dataset. Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.

Their precise identification enables advanced diagnostics, facilitates personalized treatment strategies, and supports more effective monitoring of treatment progress in clinical dentistry. However, several significant challenges may arise due to the intricate geometry of individual teeth and the substantial variations observed across different individuals. To address these complexities, the development of advanced techniques, especially through the application of deep learning, is essential for the precise and reliable detection of 3D tooth landmarks. In this context, the 3DTeethLand challenge was held in collaboration with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2024, calling for algorithms focused on teeth landmark detection from intraoral 3D scans. This challenge introduced the first publicly available dataset for 3D teeth landmark detection, offering a valuable resource to assess the state-of-the-art methods in this task and encourage the community to provide methodological contributions towards the resolution of their problem with significant clinical implications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08325v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Motion Magnification (VMM) amplifies subtle macroscopic motions to a perceptible level. Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Input features are conventionally represented as vectors, matrices, or third order tensors in the real field, for color image classification. Inspired by the success of quaternion data modeling for color images in image recovery and denoising tasks, we propose a novel classification method for color image classification, named as the Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM), in which the RGB channels are treated as pure quaternions to effectively preserve the intrinsic coupling relationships among channels via the quaternion algebra. For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model. Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed classification approach exhibits advantages in classification accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, compared to several state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent image protection mechanisms such as Glaze and Nightshade introduce imperceptible, adversarially designed perturbations intended to disrupt downstream text-to-image generative models. While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has shown significant improvement in Natural Language Processing and 2D Computer Vision. However, existing methods face difficulties in representing 3D data because of its unordered and uneven density. Through an in-depth analysis of mainstream contrastive and generative approaches, we find that contrastive models tend to suffer from overfitting, while 3D Mask Autoencoders struggle to handle unordered point clouds. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of diffusion and contrast models, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose \textit{PointDico}, a novel model that seamlessly integrates these methods. \textit{PointDico} learns from both denoising generative modeling and cross-modal contrastive learning through knowledge distillation, where the diffusion model serves as a guide for the contrastive model. We introduce a hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale geometric feature extraction and employ a dual-channel design to effectively integrate local and global contextual information. \textit{PointDico} achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, \textit{e.g.}, \textbf{94.32\%} accuracy on ScanObjectNN, \textbf{86.5\%} Inst. mIoU on ShapeNetPart.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08331v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image (HRMS). Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rendering complex reflection of real-world scenes using 3D Gaussian splatting has been a quite promising solution for photorealistic novel view synthesis, but still faces bottlenecks especially in rendering speed and memory storage. This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08337v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating BOLD images from T1w images offers a promising solution for recovering missing BOLD information and enabling downstream tasks when BOLD images are corrupted or unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose DINO-BOLDNet, a DINOv3-guided multi-slice attention framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 encoder with a lightweight trainable decoder. The model uses DINOv3 to extract within-slice structural representations, and a separate slice-attention module to fuse contextual information across neighboring slices. A multi-scale generation decoder then restores fine-grained functional contrast, while a DINO-based perceptual loss encourages structural and textural consistency between predictions and ground-truth BOLD in the transformer feature space. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects show that DINO-BOLDNet surpasses a conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. To our knowledge, this is the first framework capable of generating mean BOLD images directly from T1w images, highlighting the potential of self-supervised transformer guidance for structural-to-functional mapping.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08358v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular 3D tracking aims to capture the long-term motion of pixels in 3D space from a single monocular video and has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08362v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fire has long been linked to human life, causing severe disasters and losses. Early detection is crucial, and with the rise of home IoT technologies, household fire detection systems have emerged. However, the lack of sufficient fire datasets limits the performance of detection models. We propose the SCU-CGAN model, which integrates U-Net, CBAM, and an additional discriminator to generate realistic fire images from nonfire images. We evaluate the image quality and confirm that SCU-CGAN outperforms existing models. Specifically, SCU-CGAN achieved a 41.5% improvement in KID score compared to CycleGAN, demonstrating the superior quality of the generated fire images. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that the augmented dataset significantly improves the accuracy of fire detection models without altering their structure. For the YOLOv5 nano model, the most notable improvement was observed in the mAP@0.5:0.95 metric, which increased by 56.5%, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08374v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which couple pre-trained vision encoders and language models, have shown remarkable capabilities. However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08378v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Under challenging light conditions, captured images often suffer from various degradations, leading to a decline in the performance of vision-based applications. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08397v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Facial retouching to beautify images is widely spread in social media, advertisements, and it is even applied in professional photo studios to let individuals appear younger, remove wrinkles and skin impurities. Generally speaking, this is done to enhance beauty. This is not a problem itself, but when retouched images are used as biometric samples and enrolled in a biometric system, it is one. Since previous work has proven facial retouching to be a challenge for face recognition systems,the detection of facial retouching becomes increasingly necessary. This work proposes to study and analyze changes in beauty assessment algorithms of retouched images, assesses different feature extraction methods based on artificial intelligence in order to improve retouching detection, and evaluates whether face beauty can be exploited to enhance the detection rate. In a scenario where the attacking retouching algorithm is unknown, this work achieved 1.1% D-EER on single image detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate fisheries data are crucial for effective and sustainable marine resource management. With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species. We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) aims to reconstruct 3D human pose and shape from 2D observations and is fundamental to human-centric understanding in real-world scenarios. While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-Body4D achieves improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos, without any retraining. Our code and demo are available at: https://github.com/gaomingqi/sam-body4d.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08410v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Due to excessive memory overhead, most Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can only process videos of limited frames. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Surgical segmentation is pivotal for scene understanding yet remains hindered by annotation scarcity and semantic inconsistency across diverse procedures. Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08441v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in snapshot multispectral (MS) imaging have enabled compact, low-cost spectral sensors for consumer and mobile devices. By capturing richer spectral information than conventional RGB sensors, these systems can enhance key imaging tasks, including color correction. However, most existing methods treat the color correction pipeline in separate stages, often discarding MS data early in the process. We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures. To support training and evaluation, we construct a dedicated dataset by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets, rendering under multiple RGB camera sensitivities. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. Datasets, code, and models will be made available upon acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08445v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Subset selection-based methods are widely used to explain deep vision models: they attribute predictions by highlighting the most influential image regions and support object-level explanations. While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08467v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Football player tracking is challenged by frequent occlusions, similar appearances, and rapid motion in crowded scenes. This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08477v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drag-based image editing aims to modify visual content followed by user-specified drag operations. Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods. Code will be publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has evolved rapidly and become a key component for building world models. However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, "click-to-run" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08486v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08498v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled efficient free-viewpoint rendering and photorealistic scene reconstruction. While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08503v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) pose significant privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing privacy protection techniques, primarily designed for perception-based models, prove ineffective against MLRMs' sophisticated multi-step reasoning processes that analyze environmental cues. We introduce \textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\% vs 19.4\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\% vs 16.8\%). This work establishes a new paradigm for privacy protection against reasoning-based threats.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08505v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conditional diffusion models rely on language-to-image alignment methods to steer the generation towards semantically accurate outputs. Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings. This approach enables real-time alignment assessment during generation, reducing costs without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08506v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A major challenge in reconstructing buildings from LiDAR point clouds lies in accurately capturing building surfaces under varying point densities and noise interference. To flexibly gather high-quality 3D profiles of the building in diverse resolution, we propose OCCDiff applying latent diffusion in the occupancy function space. Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy data.

However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\%$ with $\sim 75\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08524v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) require large parameter capacity to align high-dimensional visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently. We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs). Our method maintains performance comparable to the base models while delivering significant reductions in model size and inference latency. Progressive PHM substitution thus offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08529v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: GUI grounding, which translates natural language instructions into precise pixel coordinates, is essential for developing practical GUI agents. However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08534v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Oil painting, as a high-level medium that blends human abstract thinking with artistic expression, poses substantial challenges for digital generation and editing due to its intricate brushstroke dynamics and stylized characteristics. Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving the artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving an unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil paintings generation and editing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although recent 3D-native generators have made great progress in synthesizing reliable geometry, they still fall short in achieving realistic appearances. A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms. Experiments demonstrate that Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autoregressive(AR)-diffusion hybrid paradigms combine AR's structured modeling with diffusion's photorealistic synthesis, yet suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency. Fast-ARDiff achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across diverse models: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, TransDiff attains 4.3$\times$ lossless speedup, and NextStep-1 achieves 3$\times$ acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08542v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Color image generation has a wide range of applications, but the existing generation models ignore the correlation among color channels, which may lead to chromatic aberration problems. In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08547v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion inversion aims to recover the initial noise corresponding to a given image such that this noise can reconstruct the original image through the denoising diffusion process. The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08557v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work leverages the continuous sweeping motion of LiDAR scanning to concentrate object detection efforts on specific regions that receive a change in point data from one frame to another. We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08560v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts, and in which brain regions these representations are encoded, remains a long-standing challenge. Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a modular neural image signal processing (ISP) framework that processes raw inputs and renders high-quality display-referred images. Unlike prior neural ISP designs, our method introduces a high degree of modularity, providing full control over multiple intermediate stages of the rendering process.~This modular design not only achieves high rendering accuracy but also improves scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles. To demonstrate the advantages of this design, we built a user-interactive photo-editing tool that leverages our neural ISP to support diverse editing operations and picture styles. The tool is carefully engineered to take advantage of the high-quality rendering of our neural ISP and to enable unlimited post-editable re-rendering. Our method is a fully learning-based framework with variants of different capacities, all of moderate size (ranging from ~0.5 M to ~3.9 M parameters for the entire pipeline), and consistently delivers competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08569v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) enables pre-trained models to adapt to continuously evolving domains. Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation. Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios, including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts, show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.

To fully leverage its potential, analysis methods must capture complex interactions between different cell types.

Our model encodes both local and global inter-relations in cell neighborhoods, incorporating information about cell types and morphology. Multimodal fusion, aggregating cancer stage with mIF-derived features, further boosts performance. We validate HiGINE on two public datasets, demonstrating improved risk stratification, robustness, and generalizability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08577v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video recordings of open surgeries are greatly required for education and research purposes. However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option.

We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in few-shot learning by aligning visual and textual representations. Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of "emptiness" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a foundational component in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08627v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the absence of a mechanical stabilizer, the camera undergoes inevitable rotational dynamics during capturing, which induces perspective-based blur especially under long-exposure scenarios. From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization. Relative to the real trajectory in handheld shooting settings, our optical algorithm achieves superior precision and the dense reconstruction maintains strong accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08639v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments using onboard visual observation. This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the contribution of our task design and architectural choices.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08645v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a "black box." This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08647v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Driver distraction behavior recognition using in-vehicle cameras demands real-time inference on edge devices. However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions. ROI-based methods also increase computational cost, making it difficult to balance efficiency and accuracy. This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains. These results confirm C-DIRA's effectiveness in achieving compactness, efficiency, and generalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08648v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The dominance of denoising generative models (e.g., diffusion, flow-matching) in visual synthesis is tempered by their substantial training costs and inefficiencies in representation learning. While injecting discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment has proven effective, this approach still faces key limitations: the reliance on external, pre-trained encoders introduces overhead and domain shift. A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently. On ImageNet-256, {\mname} achieves a state-of-the-art FID of \textbf{2.40} within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08673v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most existing self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D point clouds are dominated by generative methods based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE). However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch \textbf{C}enter-\textbf{S}urrounding \textbf{Con}trast (CSCon) framework. Specifically, we apply masking to the center and surrounding parts separately, constructing dual-branch inputs with center-biased and surrounding-biased representations to better capture rich geometric information. Meanwhile, we introduce a patch-level contrastive loss to further enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity. Under the FULL and ALL protocols, CSCon achieves performance comparable to generative methods; under the MLP-LINEAR, MLP-3, and ONLY-NEW protocols, our method attains state-of-the-art results, even surpassing cross-modal approaches. In particular, under the MLP-LINEAR protocol, our method outperforms the baseline (Point-MAE) by \textbf{7.9\%}, \textbf{6.7\%}, and \textbf{10.3\%} on the three variants of ScanObjectNN, respectively. The code will be made publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08697v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve impressive accuracy but remain largely opaque, leaving open the question: which high-level semantic attributes do these models actually rely on? We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect. This work offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights the requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08700v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in monocular depth estimation. However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches. Moreover, our method achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency, meeting real-time requirements.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08730v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most existing methods for training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) are based on CLIP. While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08733v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Skin color has historically been a focal point of discrimination, yet fairness research in machine learning for medical imaging often relies on coarse subgroup categories, overlooking individual-level variations. Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS). These findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems, and highlight broader implications for sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08738v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has emerged as a vital field for bridging the gap between deaf and hearing communities. However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\% accuracy and 60.00\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08747v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industrial mushroom cultivation increasingly relies on computer vision for monitoring and automated harvesting. However, developing accurate detection and segmentation models requires large, precisely annotated datasets that are costly to produce. Synthetic data provides a scalable alternative, yet often lacks sufficient realism to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel workflow that integrates 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms. This approach preserves full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations while achieving photorealism without the need for specialized computer graphics expertise. We release two synthetic datasets (each containing 6,000 images depicting over 250k mushroom instances) and evaluate Mask R-CNN models trained on them in a zero-shot setting. When tested on two independent real-world datasets (including a newly collected benchmark), our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K), despite using only synthetic training data. Although the approach is demonstrated on Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms, the proposed pipeline can be readily adapted to other mushroom species or to other agricultural domains, such as fruit and leaf detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08751v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, high-performance computer vision models have achieved remarkable success in medical imaging, with some skin lesion classification systems even surpassing dermatology specialists in diagnostic accuracy. However, such models are computationally intensive and large in size, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. In addition, strict privacy constraints hinder centralized data management, motivating the adoption of Federated Learning (FL). To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions. The proposed method was validated in a horizontal FL environment and shown to maintain performance while substantially reducing model complexity. Experiments on the compact Swin Transformer demonstrate approximately 36\% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy. These findings highlight the feasibility of achieving efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis. However, addressing artifacts and unrealistic regions remains a critical challenge. We propose self-refining diffusion, a novel framework that enhances image generation quality by detecting these flaws. The framework employs an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based flaw highlighter to produce flaw activation maps (FAMs) that identify artifacts and unrealistic regions. These FAMs improve reconstruction quality by amplifying noise in flawed regions during the forward process and by focusing on these regions during the reverse process. The proposed approach achieves up to a 27.3% improvement in Fr\'echet inception distance across various diffusion-based models, demonstrating consistently strong performance on diverse datasets. It also shows robust effectiveness across different tasks, including image generation, text-to-image generation, and inpainting. These results demonstrate that explainable AI techniques can extend beyond interpretability to actively contribute to image refinement. The proposed framework offers a versatile and effective approach applicable to various diffusion models and tasks, significantly advancing the field of image synthesis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personalizing visual generative models to meet specific user needs has gained increasing attention, yet current methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) remain impractical due to their demand for task-specific data and lengthy optimization. While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Document shadow removal is essential for enhancing the clarity of digitized documents. Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08820v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced our capabilities in cross-modal reasoning. However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation with domain changes or require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning in new domains. To address this issue, we develop a new adaptation method for large vision-language models, called \textit{Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters} (T-DHA). We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincar\'e ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08829v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: It has been hypothesized that human-level visual perception requires a generative approach in which internal representations result from inverting a decoder. Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08860v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Verifiable geometric reasoning is a critical component for trustworthy and controllable agentic AI. Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy.

However, a recent challenge in this domain is dealing with low-resolution image (LRI). While performance can be improved by using larger models like transformers for encoding, these models are typically heavyweight, demanding significant computational resources and memory, leading to challenges in retraining. To address this, the proposed SOLI (Siamese-Driven Optimization for Low-Resolution Image Latent Embedding in Image Captioning) approach presents a solution specifically designed for lightweight, low-resolution images captioning. It employs a Siamese network architecture to optimize latent embeddings, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the image-to-text translation process. By focusing on a dual-pathway neural network structure, SOLI minimizes computational overhead without sacrificing performance, making it an ideal choice for training on resource-constrained scenarios.

In this work, we enhance VLM-based visual grounding in satellite imagery by proposing a novel structured localization mechanism. Our approach involves finetuning a pretrained VLM on a diverse set of instruction-following tasks, while interfacing a dedicated grounding module through specialized control tokens for localization. This method facilitates joint reasoning over both language and spatial information, significantly enhancing the model's ability to precisely localize objects in complex satellite scenes. We evaluate our framework on several remote sensing benchmarks, consistently improving the state-of-the-art, including a 24.8% relative improvement over previous methods on visual grounding. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating structured spatial reasoning into VLMs, paving the way for more reliable real-world satellite data analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.   Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08889v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual reasoning is challenging, requiring both precise object grounding and understanding complex spatial relationships. Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08897v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Content-aware layout generation is a critical task in graphic design automation, focused on creating visually appealing arrangements of elements that seamlessly blend with a given background image. The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating high-quality, textured 3D scenes from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in vision and graphics. Recent image-to-3D generators recover reasonable geometry from single views, but their object-centric training limits generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. We present EvoScene, a self-evolving, training-free framework that progressively reconstructs complete 3D scenes from single images. The key idea is combining the complementary strengths of existing models: geometric reasoning from 3D generation models and visual knowledge from video generation models. Through three iterative stages--Spatial Prior Initialization, Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and Spatial-guided Novel View Generation--EvoScene alternates between 2D and 3D domains, gradually improving both structure and appearance. Experiments on diverse scenes demonstrate that EvoScene achieves superior geometric stability, view-consistent textures, and unseen-region completion compared to strong baselines, producing ready-to-use 3D meshes for practical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08912v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nighttime environments pose significant challenges for camera-based perception, as existing methods passively rely on the scene lighting. We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08922v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR) aims to recover high- quality images from low-quality inputs containing degraded textual content. While diffusion models provide strong gen- erative priors for general image restoration, they often pro- duce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the ab- sence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that in- tegrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an it- erative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermedi- ate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine- grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations. Experiments on the SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks demonstrate that UniT faithfully reconstructs degraded text, substantially reduces hallucinations, and achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance in TAIR task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding and reconstructing the complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08930v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) has traditionally relied on models with explicit 3D inductive biases combined with known camera parameters from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) beforehand. Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08931v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling inference-time computation has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve strong reasoning performance, but inherently sequential decoding leads to substantial latency, especially on complex tasks. Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies on Neural Collapse (NC) reveal that, under class-balanced conditions, the class feature means and classifier weights spontaneously align into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). In long-tailed regimes, however, severe sample imbalance tends to prevent the emergence of the NC phenomenon, resulting in poor generalization performance. Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets consistently boost examined baselines and achieve the state-of-the-art performances.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Benchmarking has been the cornerstone of progress in computer vision, natural language processing, and the broader deep learning domain, driving algorithmic innovation through standardized datasets and reproducible evaluation protocols. The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations. We assess eleven architectures spanning neural operator methods (e.g., Fourier Neural Operator), geometric deep learning (PointNet, RegDGCNN, PointMAE, PointTransformer), transformer-based neural solvers (Transolver, Transolver++, AB-UPT), and implicit field networks (TripNet). Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty. To accelerate progress in data-driven engineering, we open-source the benchmark framework, including training pipelines, uncertainty estimation routines based on bootstrap resampling, and pretrained model weights, establishing the first reproducible foundation for large-scale learning from high-fidelity CFD simulations, available at https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/CarBench.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: New York City reports over one hundred thousand motor vehicle collisions each year, creating substantial injury and public health burden. We present RaX-Crash, a resource efficient and explainable small model pipeline for structured injury severity prediction on the official NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset. RaX-Crash integrates three linked tables with tens of millions of records, builds a unified feature schema in partitioned storage, and trains compact tree based ensembles (Random Forest and XGBoost) on engineered tabular features, which are compared against locally deployed small language models (SLMs) prompted with textual summaries. On a temporally held out test set, XGBoost and Random Forest achieve accuracies of 0.7828 and 0.7794, clearly outperforming SLMs (0.594 and 0.496); class imbalance analysis shows that simple class weighting improves fatal recall with modest accuracy trade offs, and SHAP attribution highlights human vulnerability factors, timing, and location as dominant drivers of predicted severity. Overall, RaX-Crash indicates that interpretable small model ensembles remain strong baselines for city scale injury analytics, while hybrid pipelines that pair tabular predictors with SLM generated narratives improve communication without sacrificing scalability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07850v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite rapid progress in LLM agents, performance on long-horizon, tool-using tasks remains fragile. To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $\tau$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\ non-mutating steps and formalize \emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\%$ on Airline and upto $96\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\% \emph{relative} on Airline, +11\% on Retail, and +7\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\%/+7\%. We further identify ceiling effects in $\tau$-Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance. To address this, we release $\tau$-Bench Verified, which restores benchmark headroom through targeted revisions. Our results argue for action-level analysis, targeted safeguards, and reliable evaluations as prerequisites for robust multi-turn agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07853v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As deep learning models in agentic AI systems grow in scale and complexity, GPU memory requirements increase and often exceed the available GPU memory capacity, so that out-of-memory (OoM) errors occur. It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traffic forecasting task is significant to modern urban management. Recently, there is growing attention on large-scale forecasting, as it better reflects the complexity of real-world traffic networks. However, existing models often exhibit quadratic computational complexity, making them impractical for large-scale real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mixer (HSTMixer), which leverages an all-MLP architecture for efficient and effective large-scale traffic forecasting. HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention-based Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and shown strong performance in computer vision (CV) tasks. However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement. Experimental results show that LAPA achieves 3.52x, 3.24x and 2.79x higher energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works Spatten, Sanger and FACT, respectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07856v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate disease detection is of paramount importance for effective medical treatment and patient care. However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\% improvement in recall and 7.63\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction. By reducing diagnostic costs and improving accessibility, CLDD holds promise for large-scale disease screening and social health security.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) which have made significant progress in various tasks, but their robustness against domain noise, structural perturbations, and adversarial attacks remains underexplored. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of hierarchical structural semantics, which are crucial for generalization. In this paper, we propose SA^2GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA^2GFM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and robustness against random noise and adversarial perturbations for node and graph classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07858v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is crucial in numerous real-world applications, such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and posture recognition. TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components. Furthermore, we design an Interactive Mamba Block (IMB) to facilitate efficient multi-granularity information interaction, balancing the extraction of fine-grained discriminative features and comprehensive global contextual information, thereby endowing FAIM with powerful and expressive representations for TSC tasks. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised pre-training mechanism to enhance FAIM's understanding of complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness across various domains and high-noise scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that FAIM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and efficiency and exhibits outstanding performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07863v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semi-supervised anomaly detection (AD) has shown great promise by effectively leveraging limited labeled data. However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, we show that our model's performance consistently improves with increasing set size, providing strong empirical support for the set-based formulation of anomaly detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: New methods are needed to monitor environmental treaties, like the Montreal Protocol, by reviewing large, complex customs datasets. This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare "mega-trades" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in "mega-trades" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act. This work presents a repeatable unsupervised learning pipeline to turn raw trade data into prioritized, usable intelligence for regulatory groups.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07865v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We transform large-scale Swedish register data into textual life trajectories to address two long-standing challenges in data analysis: high cardinality of categorical variables and inconsistencies in coding schemes over time. Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The sophistication of modern malware, specifically regarding communication with Command and Control (C2) servers, has rendered static blacklist-based defenses obsolete. The use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) allows attackers to generate thousands of dynamic addresses daily, hindering blocking by traditional firewalls. This paper aims to propose and evaluate a method for detecting DGA domains using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The methodology consisted of collecting a hybrid database containing 50,000 legitimate and 50,000 malicious domains, followed by the extraction of lexical features and the training of a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Results demonstrated that while statistical entropy analysis is effective for simple DGAs, the Neural Network approach presents superiority in detecting complex patterns, reaching 97.2% accuracy and reducing the false positive rate in ambiguous lawful traffic scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bayesian optimization is widely used for optimizing expensive black box functions, but most existing approaches focus on scalar responses. In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07873v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent studies show that using diffusion models for time series signal reconstruc- tion holds great promise. However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AV) requires rigorous testing under both everyday driving and rare, safety-critical conditions. A key challenge lies in simulating environment agents, including background vehicles (BVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs), that behave realistically in nominal traffic while also exhibiting risk-prone behaviors consistent with real-world accidents. We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes. Extensive experiments show that CRAG improves diversity compared to existing baselines, while also enabling controllable generation of risk scenarios for targeted and efficient evaluation of AV robustness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07878v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Given augmented views of each input graph, contrastive learning methods (e.g., InfoNCE) optimize pairwise alignment of graph embeddings across views while providing no mechanism to control the global structure of the view specific graph-of-graphs built from these embeddings. We introduce SpecMatch-CL, a novel loss function that aligns the view specific graph-of-graphs by minimizing the difference between their normalized Laplacians. Theoretically, we show that under certain assumptions, the difference between normalized Laplacians provides an upper bound not only for the difference between the ideal Perfect Alignment contrastive loss and the current loss, but also for the Uniformly loss. Empirically, SpecMatch-CL establishes new state of the art on eight TU benchmarks under unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning at low label rates, and yields consistent gains in transfer learning on PPI-306K and ZINC 2M datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used tool for learning parts-based, low-dimensional representations of nonnegative data, with applications in vision, text, and bioinformatics. In clustering applications, orthogonal NMF (ONMF) variants further impose (approximate) orthogonality on the representation matrix so that its rows behave like soft cluster indicators. Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or "topics". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\mathbf{X}^\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity. These results demonstrate that explicitly recovering the data cone can yield both theoretically grounded and empirically strong NMF-based clustering methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07880v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful method in deep learning, excelling at learning effective representations through contrasting samples from different distributions. However, dimensional collapse, where embeddings converge into a lower-dimensional space, poses a significant challenge, especially in semi-supervised and self-supervised setups. In this paper, we first identify a critical learning-rate threshold, beyond which standard contrastive losses converge to collapsed solutions. Building on these insights, we propose CLOP, a novel semi-supervised loss function designed to prevent dimensional collapse by promoting the formation of orthogonal linear subspaces among class embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CLOP improves performance in image classification and object detection tasks while also exhibiting greater stability across different learning rates and batch sizes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07884v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient vision transformer remains a bottleneck for high-resolution images and long-video related real-world applications. Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclones (TCs) tracking represents a critical challenge in the context of weather and climate science. Traditional tracking schemes mainly rely on subjective thresholds, which may introduce biases in their skills on the geographical region of application. We present ByteStorm, an efficient data-driven framework for reconstructing TC tracks without threshold tuning. It leverages deep learning networks to detect TC centers (via classification and localization), using only relative vorticity (850 mb) and mean sea-level pressure. Then, detected centers are linked into TC tracks through the BYTE algorithm. ByteStorm is evaluated against state-of-the-art deterministic trackers in the East- and West-North Pacific basins (ENP and WNP). The proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of Probability of Detection ($85.05\%$ ENP, $79.48\%$ WNP), False Alarm Rate ($23.26\%$ ENP, $16.14\%$ WNP), and high Inter-Annual Variability correlations ($0.75$ ENP and $0.69$ WNP). These results highlight the potential of integrating deep learning and computer vision for fast and accurate TC tracking, offering a robust alternative to traditional approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07961v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Continual learning constrains models to learn new tasks over time without forgetting what they have already learned. A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance. We demonstrate that CIPNet achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to previous exemplar-free and self-explainable methods in both task- and class-incremental settings, while bearing significantly lower memory-related overhead. This makes it a practical and interpretable solution for continual learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07988v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their learned representations and decision-making processes remain largely opaque and hard to interpret. This work introduces HOLE (Homological Observation of Latent Embeddings), a method for analyzing and interpreting deep neural networks through persistent homology. HOLE extracts topological features from neural activations and presents them using a suite of visualization techniques, including Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, dendrograms, and blob graphs. These tools facilitate the examination of representation structure and quality across layers. We evaluate HOLE on standard datasets using a range of discriminative models, focusing on representation quality, interpretability across layers, and robustness to input perturbations and model compression. The results indicate that topological analysis reveals patterns associated with class separation, feature disentanglement, and model robustness, providing a complementary perspective for understanding and improving deep learning systems.

This article presents a web platform that makes the process of analyzing and plotting data, training forecasting models, and interpreting and viewing results accessible to researchers and clinicians. Users can upload data and generate plots to showcase their variables and the relationships between them. The platform supports multiple forecasting models and training techniques which are highly customizable according to the user's needs. Additionally, recommendations and explanations can be generated from a large language model that can help the user choose appropriate parameters for their data and understand the results for each model. The goal is to integrate this platform into learning health systems for continuous data collection and inference from clinical pipelines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08012v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In critical care settings such as the Intensive Care Unit, clinicians face the complex challenge of balancing conflicting objectives, primarily maximizing patient survival while minimizing resource utilization (e.g., length of stay). Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.   In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08029v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical decision-making in oncology requires predicting dynamic disease evolution, a task current static AI predictors cannot perform. While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning. On the MU-Glioma-Post dataset, our approach outperforms recent MeWM by 12\%, and significantly surpasses all other medical-specific large language models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling attention faces a critical bottleneck: the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ quadratic computational cost of softmax attention, which limits its application in long-sequence domains. While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08063v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose an interpretable deep competing risks model called the Deep Kernel Aalen-Johansen (DKAJ) estimator, which generalizes the classical Aalen-Johansen nonparametric estimate of cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). Each data point (e.g., patient) is represented as a weighted combination of clusters. If a data point has nonzero weight only for one cluster, then its predicted CIFs correspond to those of the classical Aalen-Johansen estimator restricted to data points from that cluster. These weights come from an automatically learned kernel function that measures how similar any two data points are. On four standard competing risks datasets, we show that DKAJ is competitive with state-of-the-art baselines while being able to provide visualizations to assist model interpretation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Crisis classification in social media aims to extract actionable disaster-related information from multimodal posts, which is a crucial task for enhancing situational awareness and facilitating timely emergency responses. However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since the advent of machine learning, interpretability has remained a persistent challenge, becoming increasingly urgent as generative models support high-stakes applications in drug and material discovery. Recent advances in large language model (LLM) architectures have yielded chemistry language models (CLMs) with impressive capabilities in molecular property prediction and molecular generation. However, how these models internally represent chemical knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend sparse autoencoder techniques to uncover and examine interpretable features within CLMs. Applying our methodology to the Foundation Models for Materials (FM4M) SMI-TED chemistry foundation model, we extract semantically meaningful latent features and analyse their activation patterns across diverse molecular datasets. Our findings reveal that these models encode a rich landscape of chemical concepts. We identify correlations between specific latent features and distinct domains of chemical knowledge, including structural motifs, physicochemical properties, and pharmacological drug classes. Our approach provides a generalisable framework for uncovering latent knowledge in chemistry-focused AI systems. This work has implications for both foundational understanding and practical deployment; with the potential to accelerate computational chemistry research.

For randomly initialized, fully connected 1D ReLU networks (He scaling with nonzero bias) in the infinite-width limit, we prove that the expected number of linear regions grows as $\sum_{i = 1}^L n_i + \mathop{{o}}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^L{n_i}\right) + 1$, where $n_\ell$ denotes the number of neurons in the $\ell$-th hidden layer. We also propose a function-adaptive notion of sparsity that compares the expected regions used by the network to the minimal number needed to approximate a target within a fixed tolerance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be dishonest when reporting on their actions and beliefs -- for example, they may overstate their confidence in factual claims or cover up evidence of covert actions. Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.   In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the "path of least resistance" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.   To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its "main" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we study whether model-based reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based value expansion, can provide a scalable recipe for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in offline RL. Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an "action chunk") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}. Through experiments on highly challenging tasks with large-scale datasets of up to 100M transitions, we show that MAC achieves the best performance among offline model-based RL algorithms, especially on challenging long-horizon tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08121v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08124v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper will propose a novel machine learning based portfolio management method in the context of the cryptocurrency market. Previous researchers mainly focus on the prediction of the movement for specific cryptocurrency such as the bitcoin(BTC) and then trade according to the prediction. In contrast to the previous work that treats the cryptocurrencies independently, this paper manages a group of cryptocurrencies by analyzing the relative relationship. Specifically, in each time step, we utilize the neural network to predict the rank of the future return of the managed cryptocurrencies and place weights accordingly. By incorporating such cross-sectional information, the proposed methods is shown to profitable based on the backtesting experiments on the real daily cryptocurrency market data from May, 2020 to Nov, 2023. During this 3.5 years, the market experiences the full cycle of bullish, bearish and stagnant market conditions. Despite under such complex market conditions, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.01 and annualized return of 64.26%. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be robust to the increase of transaction fee.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08129v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most post-training backdoor detection methods rely on attacked models exhibiting extreme outlier detection statistics for the target class of an attack, compared to non-target classes. However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08130v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons. An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in various applications underscores the need for agents that can successfully navigate and adapt to an ever-changing, open-ended world. A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08143v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language identification is a crucial first step in multilingual systems such as chatbots and virtual assistants, enabling linguistically and culturally accurate user experiences. Errors at this stage can cascade into downstream failures, setting a high bar for accuracy. Yet, existing language identification tools struggle with key cases--such as music requests where the song title and user language differ. Open-source tools like LangDetect, FastText are fast but less accurate, while large language models, though effective, are often too costly for low-latency or low-resource settings. We introduce PolyLingua, a lightweight Transformer-based model for in-domain language detection and fine-grained language classification. It employs a two-level contrastive learning framework combining instance-level separation and class-level alignment with adaptive margins, yielding compact and well-separated embeddings even for closely related languages. Evaluated on two challenging datasets--Amazon Massive (multilingual digital assistant utterances) and a Song dataset (music requests with frequent code-switching)--PolyLingua achieves 99.25% F1 and 98.15% F1, respectively, surpassing Sonnet 3.5 while using 10x fewer parameters, making it ideal for compute- and latency-constrained environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08153v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for aligning generative models with human preferences, but its prohibitive computational cost remains a major barrier to widespread adoption. We introduce \textbf{TreeGRPO}, a novel RL framework that dramatically improves training efficiency by recasting the denoising process as a search tree. From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \textbf{2.4$\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space. Our method consistently outperforms GRPO baselines across multiple benchmarks and reward models, providing a scalable and effective pathway for RL-based visual generative model alignment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08160v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In our prior work, LayerPipe, we had introduced an approach to accelerate training of convolutional, fully connected, and spiking neural networks by overlapping forward and backward computation. However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08211v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile phones are the most ubiquitous end devices, generating vast amounts of human-authored data and serving as the primary platform for end-side applications. As high-quality public data for large language models (LLMs) approaches exhaustion, on-device fine-tuning provides an opportunity to leverage private user data while preserving privacy. However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations and establish MobileFineTuner as a viable foundation for future research on on-device LLM training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08217v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decoupled weight decay, solely responsible for the performance advantage of AdamW over Adam, has long been set to proportional to learning rate $\gamma$ without questioning. Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\propto \gamma^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\propto \gamma^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\propto \gamma^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08218v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Capsule Networks (CapsNets) show exceptional graph representation capacity via dynamic routing and vectorized hierarchical representations, but they model the complex geometries of real\-world graphs poorly by fixed\-curvature space due to the inherent geodesical disconnectedness issues, leading to suboptimal performance. Recent works find that non\-Euclidean pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding graph data, but how to leverage them to improve CapsNets is still underexplored. Here, we extend the Euclidean capsule routing into geodesically disconnected pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds and derive a Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Network (PR\-CapsNet), which models data in pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of adaptive curvature, for graph representation learning. Specifically, PR\-CapsNet enhances the CapsNet with Adaptive Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing by utilizing pseudo\-Riemannian geometry. Unlike single\-curvature or subspace\-partitioning methods, PR\-CapsNet concurrently models hierarchical and cluster or cyclic graph structures via its versatile pseudo\-Riemannian metric. It first deploys Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing to decompose capsule states into spherical\-temporal and Euclidean\-spatial subspaces with diffeomorphic transformations. Then, an Adaptive Curvature Routing is developed to adaptively fuse features from different curvature spaces for complex graphs via a learnable curvature tensor with geometric attention from local manifold properties. Finally, a geometric properties\-preserved Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Classifier is developed to project capsule embeddings to tangent spaces and use curvature\-weighted softmax for classification. Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks show PR\-CapsNet outperforms SOTA models, validating PR\-CapsNet's strong representation power for complex graph structures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a mathematically rigorous framework for brain-inspired representation learning founded on the interplay between persistent topological structures and cohomological flows. Neural computation is reformulated as the evolution of cochain maps over dynamic simplicial complexes, enabling representations that capture invariants across temporal, spatial, and functional brain states. The proposed architecture integrates algebraic topology with differential geometry to construct cohomological operators that generalize gradient-based learning within a homological landscape. Synthetic data with controlled topological signatures and real neural datasets are jointly analyzed using persistent homology, sheaf cohomology, and spectral Laplacians to quantify stability, continuity, and structural preservation. Empirical results demonstrate that the model achieves superior manifold consistency and noise resilience compared to graph neural and manifold-based deep architectures, establishing a coherent mathematical foundation for topology-driven representation learning.

These experimental results demonstrate that prototype-based feature transformation can enhance both accuracy and robustness in time series classification.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work proposes a wavelet-based physics-informed quantum neural network framework to efficiently address multiscale partial differential equations that involve sharp gradients, stiffness, rapid local variations, and highly oscillatory behavior. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems.

We present a unified geometric-stochastic multimodal deep learning framework that integrates EEG, ECG, respiration, SpO2, EMG, and fMRI signals to model SUDEP and stroke vulnerability. The approach combines Riemannian manifold embeddings, Lie-group invariant feature representations, fractional stochastic dynamics, Hamiltonian energy-flow modeling, and cross-modal attention mechanisms. Stroke propagation is modeled using fractional epidemic diffusion over structural brain graphs. Experiments on the MULTI-CLARID dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and interpretable biomarkers derived from manifold curvature, fractional memory indices, attention entropy, and diffusion centrality. The proposed framework provides a mathematically principled foundation for early detection, risk stratification, and interpretable multimodal modeling in neural-autonomic disorders.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in evolving environments, particularly regarding data heterogeneity and the rigidity of fixed network topologies. To address these issues, this paper proposes \textbf{SOFA-FL} (Self-Organizing Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Clustered Data Sharing), a novel framework that enables hierarchical federated systems to self-organize and adapt over time.   The framework is built upon three core mechanisms: (1) \textbf{Dynamic Multi-branch Agglomerative Clustering (DMAC)}, which constructs an initial efficient hierarchical structure; (2) \textbf{Self-organizing Hierarchical Adaptive Propagation and Evolution (SHAPE)}, which allows the system to dynamically restructure its topology through atomic operations -- grafting, pruning, consolidation, and purification -- to adapt to changes in data distribution; and (3) \textbf{Adaptive Clustered Data Sharing}, which mitigates data heterogeneity by enabling controlled partial data exchange between clients and cluster nodes.   By integrating these mechanisms, SOFA-FL effectively captures dynamic relationships among clients and enhances personalization capabilities without relying on predetermined cluster structures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08274v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a rich source of structured, heterogeneous data, powering a wide range of applications. A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Axis-aligned decision trees are fast and stable but struggle on datasets with rotated or interaction-dependent decision boundaries, where informative splits require linear combinations of features rather than single-feature thresholds. Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning framework that enables multiple clients (coordinated by a server) to collaboratively train a global model by aggregating the locally trained models without sharing any client's training data. It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08371v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Datasets may contain observations with multiple labels. If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08443v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) seeks to remove the influence of specified data from a trained model in response to privacy requests or data poisoning. While certified unlearning has been analyzed in centralized and server-orchestrated federated settings (via guarantees analogous to differential privacy, DP), the decentralized setting -- where peers communicate without a coordinator remains underexplored. We study certified unlearning in decentralized networks with fixed topologies and propose RR-DU, a random-walk procedure that performs one projected gradient ascent step on the forget set at the unlearning client and a geometrically distributed number of projected descent steps on the retained data elsewhere, combined with subsampled Gaussian noise and projection onto a trust region around the original model. We provide (i) convergence guarantees in the convex case and stationarity guarantees in the nonconvex case, (ii) $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ network-unlearning certificates on client views via subsampled Gaussian $R\'enyi$ DP (RDP) with segment-level subsampling, and (iii) deletion-capacity bounds that scale with the forget-to-local data ratio and quantify the effect of decentralization (network mixing and randomized subsampling) on the privacy--utility trade-off. Empirically, on image benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10), RR-DU matches a given $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ while achieving higher test accuracy than decentralized DP baselines and reducing forget accuracy to random guessing ($\approx 10\%$).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper, the second in a series of three, describes the second component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework: the generation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. The development process involved three complementary approaches: 1) web-based prompt generation, 2) red teaming, and 3) mining existing benchmark corpora, to generate over 7,000 potential benchmarks linked to the Task-Query Architecture that was developed during the first component of the project. A process of de-duplication, followed by an assessment of uplift diagnosticity, and general quality control measures, reduced the candidates to a set of 1,010 final benchmarks. This procedure ensured that these benchmarks are a) diagnostic in terms of providing uplift; b) directly relevant to biosecurity threats; and c) are aligned with a larger biosecurity architecture permitting nuanced analysis at different levels of analysis.

Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper discusses the pilot implementation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. It is the third in a series of three papers describing an overall Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework, with previous papers detailing the development of the B3 dataset. The pilot involved running the benchmarks through a sample frontier AI model, followed by human evaluation of model responses, and an applied risk analysis of the results along several dimensions. Overall, the pilot demonstrated that the B3 dataset offers a viable, nuanced method for rapidly assessing the biosecurity risk posed by a LLM, identifying the key sources of that risk and providing guidance for priority areas of mitigation priority.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08462v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decoding brain states from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is vital for advancing neuroscience and clinical applications. While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have made strides in leveraging the high-dimensional and complex nature of fMRI data, they often fail to utilize the contextual richness provided by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata. This paper presents a novel framework integrating transformer-based architectures with multimodal inputs, including fMRI data and DICOM metadata. By employing attention mechanisms, the proposed method captures intricate spatial-temporal patterns and contextual relationships, enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. The potential of this framework spans applications in clinical diagnostics, cognitive neuroscience, and personalized medicine. Limitations, such as metadata variability and computational demands, are addressed, and future directions for optimizing scalability and generalizability are discussed.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The relationship between Layer Normalization (LN) placement and the over-smoothing phenomenon remains underexplored. We identify a critical dilemma: Pre-LN architectures avoid over-smoothing but suffer from the curse of depth, while Post-LN architectures bypass the curse of depth but experience over-smoothing.   To resolve this, we propose a new method based on Post-LN that induces algebraic smoothing, preventing over-smoothing without the curse of depth. Empirical results across five benchmarks demonstrate that our approach supports deeper networks (up to 256 layers) and improves performance, requiring no additional parameters.   Key contributions:   Theoretical Characterization: Analysis of LN dynamics and their impact on over-smoothing and the curse of depth.   A Principled Solution: A parameter-efficient method that induces algebraic smoothing and avoids over-smoothing and the curse of depth.   Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the method in deeper GNNs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08499v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and uncertainty-aware degradation estimation is essential for predictive maintenance in safety-critical systems like rotating machinery with rolling-element bearings. Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs. Results show that PG-SNGP and PG-SNER improve prediction accuracy, generalize reliably under OOD conditions, and remain robust to adversarial attacks and noise.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08567v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stock market prediction is a long-standing challenge in finance, as accurate forecasts support informed investment decisions. Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08591v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of professional basketball games, particularly in the National Basketball Association (NBA), has become increasingly important for coaching strategy, fan engagement, and sports betting. However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work \cite{arifgroup} introduced Federated Proximal Gradient \textbf{(\texttt{FedProxGrad})} for solving non-convex composite optimization problems in group fair federated learning. However, the original analysis established convergence only to a \textit{noise-dominated neighborhood of stationarity}, with explicit dependence on a variance-induced noise floor. In this work, we provide an improved asymptotic convergence analysis for a generalized \texttt{FedProxGrad}-type analytical framework with inexact local proximal solutions and explicit fairness regularization. We call this extended analytical framework \textbf{DS \texttt{FedProxGrad}} (Decay Step Size \texttt{FedProxGrad}). Under a Robbins-Monro step-size schedule \cite{robbins1951stochastic} and a mild decay condition on local inexactness, we prove that $\liminf_{r\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}^r)\|^2] = 0$, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically stationary and the convergence rate does not depend on a variance-induced noise floor.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08699v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Part qualification is crucial in additive manufacturing (AM) because it ensures that additively manufactured parts can be consistently produced and reliably used in critical applications. Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08724v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality, yet they have been repeatedly shown to exhibit social biases across sensitive attributes such as gender, race and age. To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart. Our findings uncover TTI vulnerabilities, while BGPS expands the bias search space and can act as a new evaluation tool for bias mitigation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The advancement of human healthspan and bioengineering relies heavily on predicting the behavior of complex biological systems. While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets. Furthermore, the NODE models demonstrated a 1000x acceleration in inference time, establishing them as a scalable, high-fidelity tool for the next generation of metabolic engineering and biological discovery.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08763v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early graph prompt tuning approaches relied on task-specific designs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting their adaptability across diverse pre-training strategies. In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.

However, de novo TPS design through directed evolution is costly and slow. We introduce TpsGPT, a generative model for scalable TPS protein design, built by fine-tuning the protein language model ProtGPT2 on 79k TPS sequences mined from UniProt. TpsGPT generated de novo enzyme candidates in silico and we evaluated them using multiple validation metrics, including EnzymeExplorer classification, ESMFold structural confidence (pLDDT), sequence diversity, CLEAN classification, InterPro domain detection, and Foldseek structure alignment. From an initial pool of 28k generated sequences, we identified seven putative TPS enzymes that satisfied all validation criteria. Experimental validation confirmed TPS enzymatic activity in at least two of these sequences. Our results show that fine-tuning of a protein language model on a carefully curated, enzyme-class-specific dataset, combined with rigorous filtering, can enable the de novo generation of functional, evolutionarily distant enzymes.

Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08805v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Uplift modeling estimates the causal effect of an intervention as the difference between potential outcomes under treatment and control, whereas counterfactual identification aims to recover the joint distribution of these potential outcomes (e.g., "Would this customer still have churned had we given them a marketing offer?"). This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the increasing reliance on AI models for weather forecasting, it is imperative to evaluate their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08855v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: TD($\lambda$) with function approximation has proved empirically successful for some complex reinforcement learning problems. For linear approximation, TD($\lambda$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value. However, as far as policy is concerned, it is error in the relative ordering of states that is critical, rather than error in the state values. We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($\lambda$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($\lambda$), called STD($\lambda$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($\lambda$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1]. This is followed by successful demonstrations of STD($\lambda$) on the two-state system and a variation on the well known acrobot problem.

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model. We conclude that acceleration-aware diffusion refinement provides an effective approach to align motion generation and IMU synthesis and highlights how flexible deep learning pipelines are for specialising generic text-to-motion priors to sensor-specific tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08869v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The widespread use of big data across sectors has raised major privacy concerns, especially when sensitive information is shared or analyzed. Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08870v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM agents are widely deployed in complex interactive tasks, yet privacy constraints often preclude centralized optimization and co-evolution across dynamic environments. While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-quality tabular synthetic data. In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit temporal dynamics characterized by evolving data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Industrial maintenance is being transformed by the Internet of Things and edge computing, generating continuous data streams that demand real-time, adaptive decision-making under limited computational resources. While data stream mining (DSM) addresses this challenge, most methods assume fully supervised settings, yet in practice, ground-truth labels are often delayed or unavailable. This paper presents a collaborative DSM framework that integrates unsupervised anomaly detection with interactive, human-in-the-loop learning to support maintenance decisions. We employ an online Isolation Forest and enhance interpretability using incremental Partial Dependence Plots and a feature importance score, derived from deviations of Individual Conditional Expectation curves from a fading average, enabling users to dynamically reassess feature relevance and adjust anomaly thresholds. We describe the real-time implementation and provide initial results for fault detection in a Jacquard loom unit. Ongoing work targets continuous monitoring to predict and explain imminent bearing failures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08894v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally focus on proxy metrics like pretraining loss, predicting downstream task performance has been considered unreliable. This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08895v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08896v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful path toward discovering sustainable polymer materials, but progress has been limited by the lack of large, high-quality, and openly accessible polymer datasets. The Open Polymer Challenge (OPC) addresses this gap by releasing the first community-developed benchmark for polymer informatics, featuring a dataset with 10K polymers and 5 properties: thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, density, fractional free volume, and glass transition temperature. The challenge centers on multi-task polymer property prediction, a core step in virtual screening pipelines for materials discovery. Participants developed models under realistic constraints that include small data, label imbalance, and heterogeneous simulation sources, using techniques such as feature-based augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, and targeted ensemble strategies. The competition also revealed important lessons about data preparation, distribution shifts, and cross-group simulation consistency, informing best practices for future large-scale polymer datasets. The resulting models, analysis, and released data create a new foundation for molecular AI in polymer science and are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable and energy-efficient materials. Along with the competition, we release the test dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexliu99/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025-test-data. We also release the data generation pipeline at https://github.com/sobinalosious/ADEPT, which simulates more than 25 properties, including thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, and density.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory necessitates hardware-aware software design paradigms. This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07926v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enterprise data management is a monumental task. It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.

We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs.

Among current state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek exhibit strong capabilities in mathematics, science, medicine, literature, and programming. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of these two LLMs through background technology analysis, empirical experiments, and a real-world user survey. The evaluation explores trade-offs among model accuracy, computational efficiency, and user experience in educational and research affairs. We benchmarked these LLMs performance in text generation, programming, and specialized problem-solving. Experimental results show that ChatGPT excels in general language understanding and text generation, while DeepSeek demonstrates superior performance in programming tasks due to its efficiency- focused design. Moreover, both models deliver medically accurate diagnostic outputs and effectively solve complex mathematical problems. Complementing these quantitative findings, a survey of students, educators, and researchers highlights the practical benefits and limitations of these models, offering deeper insights into their role in advancing education and research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08147v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rising global prevalence of diabetes necessitates early detection to prevent severe complications. While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability. The implementation of asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ proved crucial in minimizing the error rate for computationally intensive prediction requests, ensuring system reliability by queuing requests and preventing data loss under heavy load.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08230v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called "empowerment" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. "Empowerment" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting diseases solely from patient-side information, such as demographics and self-reported symptoms, has attracted significant research attention due to its potential to enhance patient awareness, facilitate early healthcare engagement, and improve healthcare system efficiency. However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.

Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on Level II, led by GPT-5 at 94.3%. On Level III, Gemini 2.5 Pro attains the highest score with 86.4% on multiple-choice questions while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves 92.0% on constructed-response questions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern businesses are increasingly challenged by the time and expense required to generate and assess high-quality content. Human writers face time constraints, and extrinsic evaluations can be costly. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in content creation, concerns about the quality of AI-generated content persist. Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations. The study provides critical insights into enhancing LLMs for producing business-aligned, high-quality content, offering significant advancements in automated content generation and evaluation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agents, language model (LM)-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08300v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08340v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\"urkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08343v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08344v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data with graph structures. The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08345v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08366v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often rely on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, leading to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08379v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Biosignals collected from wearable devices are widely utilized in healthcare applications. Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08411v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model-based planning in robotic domains is fundamentally challenged by the hybrid nature of physical dynamics, where continuous motion is punctuated by discrete events such as contacts and impacts. Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08449v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces the Impact-Driven AI Framework (IDAIF), a novel architectural methodology that integrates Theory of Change (ToC) principles with modern artificial intelligence system design. As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains. This framework represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08463v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08492v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have revolutionized function-level code generation; however, repository-scale Automated Program Repair (APR) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the "Semantic Trap" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08512v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and rapid state-of-health (SOH) monitoring plays an important role in indicating energy information for lithium-ion battery-powered portable mobile devices. To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08536v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ethical awareness is critical for robots operating in human environments, yet existing automated planning tools provide little support. Manually specifying ethical rules is labour-intensive and highly context-specific. We present Principles2Plan, an interactive research prototype demonstrating how a human and a Large Language Model (LLM) can collaborate to produce context-sensitive ethical rules and guide automated planning. A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy. The system generates operationalisable ethical rules consistent with these principles, which the user can review, prioritise, and supply to a planner to produce ethically-informed plans. To our knowledge, no prior system supports users in generating principle-grounded rules for classical planning contexts. Principles2Plan showcases the potential of human-LLM collaboration for making ethical automated planning more practical and feasible.

In clinical research, AI supports automated adverse event detection in clinical trials, patient eligibility screening for protocol enrollment, and data quality validation. Beyond healthcare, AI is transforming finance through real-time fraud detection, automated loan risk assessment, and algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. To address these concerns, we introduce the SMART+ Framework - a structured model built on the pillars of Safety, Monitoring, Accountability, Reliability, and Transparency, and further enhanced with Privacy & Security, Data Governance, Fairness & Bias, and Guardrails. SMART+ offers a practical, comprehensive approach to evaluating and governing AI systems across industries. This framework aligns with evolving mechanisms and regulatory guidance to integrate operational safeguards, oversight procedures, and strengthened privacy and governance controls. SMART+ demonstrates risk mitigation, trust-building, and compliance readiness. By enabling responsible AI adoption and ensuring auditability, SMART+ provides a robust foundation for effective AI governance in clinical research.

Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy. The findings indicate that mimetic, agent-based collaboration provides a scalable, interpretable, and clinically robust paradigm for automated decision support in oncology.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08740v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Currently, there exists a fundamental divide between the "cognitive black box" (implicit intuition) of human experts and the "computational black box" (untrustworthy decision-making) of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper proposes a new paradigm of "human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement," aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible "functional white-box" system through structured "meta-interaction." The core breakthrough lies in the "plug-and-play cognitive framework"--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a thinking partner." This work not only provides the first engineering proof for "cognitive equity" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through "transparency of interaction protocols" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models. The framework is open-sourced to promote technology for good and cognitive inclusion. This paper is an independent exploratory research conducted by the author. All content presented, including the theoretical framework (RAMTN), methodology (meta-interaction), system implementation, and case validation, constitutes the author's individual research achievements.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08743v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly assuming the role of the "brain" of AI agents. While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.

When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08769v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Agentic AI marks a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08826v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative components, such as LoRAs, has created a vast but unstructured ecosystem. Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.

At the same time, many relevant knowledge representation formalisms do in general not have Craig or uniform interpolation, and computing interpolants in practice is challenging. We have a closer look at two prominent knowledge representation formalisms, description logics and logic programming, and discuss theoretical results and practical methods for computing interpolants.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation agents have rapidly advanced in their ability to reason and interact with real environments, making the evaluation of their core capabilities increasingly important. While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration. By grounding evaluation in real e-commerce contexts, EcomBench provides a rigorous and dynamic testbed for measuring the practical capabilities of agents in modern e-commerce.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robotic perception often requires solving large nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problems. While sparsity has been well-exploited to scale solvers, a complementary and underexploited structure is \emph{separability} -- where some variables (e.g., visual landmarks) appear linearly in the residuals and, for any estimate of the remaining variables (e.g., poses), have a closed-form solution. Variable projection (VarPro) methods are a family of techniques that exploit this structure by analytically eliminating the linear variables and presenting a reduced problem in the remaining variables that has favorable properties. However, VarPro has seen limited use in robotic perception; a major challenge arises from gauge symmetries (e.g., cost invariance to global shifts and rotations), which are common in perception and induce specific computational challenges in standard VarPro approaches. We present a VarPro scheme designed for problems with gauge symmetries that jointly exploits separability and sparsity. Our method can be applied as a one-time preprocessing step to construct a \emph{matrix-free Schur complement operator}. This operator allows efficient evaluation of costs, gradients, and Hessian-vector products of the reduced problem and readily integrates with standard iterative NLS solvers. We provide precise conditions under which our method applies, and describe extensions when these conditions are only partially met. Across synthetic and real benchmarks in SLAM, SNL, and SfM, our approach achieves up to \textbf{2$\times$--35$\times$ faster runtimes} than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. We release an open-source C++ implementation and all datasets from our experiments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training end-to-end policies from image data to directly predict navigation actions for robotic systems has proven inherently difficult. Existing approaches often suffer from either the sim-to-real gap during policy transfer or a limited amount of training data with action labels. To address this problem, we introduce Vision-Language Distance (VLD) learning, a scalable framework for goal-conditioned navigation that decouples perception learning from policy learning. Instead of relying on raw sensory inputs during policy training, we first train a self-supervised distance-to-goal predictor on internet-scale video data. This predictor generalizes across both image- and text-based goals, providing a distance signal that can be minimized by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The RL policy can be trained entirely in simulation using privileged geometric distance signals, with injected noise to mimic the uncertainty of the trained distance predictor. At deployment, the policy consumes VLD predictions, inheriting semantic goal information-"where to go"-from large-scale visual training while retaining the robust low-level navigation behaviors learned in simulation. We propose using ordinal consistency to assess distance functions directly and demonstrate that VLD outperforms prior temporal distance approaches, such as ViNT and VIP. Experiments show that our decoupled design achieves competitive navigation performance in simulation while supporting flexible goal modalities, providing an alternative and, most importantly, scalable path toward reliable, multimodal navigation policies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.07998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present DIJIT, a novel binocular robotic head expressly designed for mobile agents that behave as active observers. DIJIT's unique breadth of functionality enables active vision research and the study of human-like eye and head-neck motions, their interrelationships, and how each contributes to visual ability. DIJIT is also being used to explore the differences between how human vision employs eye/head movements to solve visual tasks and current computer vision methods. DIJIT's design features nine mechanical degrees of freedom, while the cameras and lenses provide an additional four optical degrees of freedom. The ranges and speeds of the mechanical design are comparable to human performance. Our design includes the ranges of motion required for convergent stereo, namely, vergence, version, and cyclotorsion. The exploration of the utility of these to both human and machine vision is ongoing. Here, we present the design of DIJIT and evaluate aspects of its performance. We present a new method for saccadic camera movements. In this method, a direct relationship between camera orientation and motor values is developed. The resulting saccadic camera movements are close to human movements in terms of their accuracy.

By distributing sensors across multiple agents, the system extends flight duration and enhances data availability, reducing the risk of mission failure due to collisions. To mitigate this risk further, we introduce an autonomous navigation framework that utilizes a local Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map for obstacle avoidance while maintaining swarm formation with minimal path deviation. Additionally, we incorporate a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variant to optimize area coverage, prioritizing Points of Interest (POIs) based on preassigned values derived from environmental behavior and critical infrastructure. The proposed system is validated through simulations with varying swarm sizes, demonstrating its ability to maximize coverage while ensuring collision avoidance between UAVs and obstacles.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08052v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied agents, such as robots and virtual characters, must continuously select actions to execute tasks effectively, solving complex sequential decision-making problems. Given the difficulty of designing such controllers manually, learning-based approaches have emerged as promising alternatives, most notably Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Deep Imitation Learning (DIL). DRL leverages reward signals to optimize behavior, while DIL uses expert demonstrations to guide learning. This document introduces DRL and DIL in the context of embodied agents, adopting a concise, depth-first approach to the literature. It is self-contained, presenting all necessary mathematical and machine learning concepts as they are needed. It is not intended as a survey of the field; rather, it focuses on a small set of foundational algorithms and techniques, prioritizing in-depth understanding over broad coverage. The material ranges from Markov Decision Processes to REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for DRL, and from Behavioral Cloning to Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) for DIL.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs. This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics. Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance. Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.

Our approach eliminates the need for an initial transform and remains robust even with large positional and rotational LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters. We employ the Gluestick pipeline to establish 2D-3D point and line feature correspondences for a robust and automatic initial guess. To enhance accuracy, we quantitatively analyze the impact of feature distribution on calibration results and adaptively weight the cost of each feature based on these metrics. As a result, extrinsic parameters are optimized by filtering out the adverse effects of inferior features. We validated our method through extensive experiments across various LiDAR-camera sensors in both indoor and outdoor settings. The results demonstrate that our method provides superior robustness and accuracy compared to SOTA techniques. Our code is open-sourced on GitHub to benefit the community.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08186v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While recent large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved generalization in vision-language navigation (VLN), existing methods typically rely on end-to-end pipelines that map vision-language inputs directly to short-horizon discrete actions. Such designs often produce fragmented motions, incur high latency, and struggle with real-world challenges like dynamic obstacle avoidance. We propose DualVLN, the first dual-system VLN foundation model that synergistically integrates high-level reasoning with low-level action execution. System 2, a VLM-based global planner, "grounds slowly" by predicting mid-term waypoint goals via image-grounded reasoning. System 1, a lightweight, multi-modal conditioning Diffusion Transformer policy, "moves fast" by leveraging both explicit pixel goals and latent features from System 2 to generate smooth and accurate trajectories. The dual-system design enables robust real-time control and adaptive local decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. By decoupling training, the VLM retains its generalization, while System 1 achieves interpretable and effective local navigation. DualVLN outperforms prior methods across all VLN benchmarks and real-world experiments demonstrate robust long-horizon planning and real-time adaptability in dynamic environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models have emerged as a pivotal component in robot manipulation planning, enabling agents to predict future environmental states and reason about the consequences of actions before execution. While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Synchronous Dual-Arm Rearrange- ment Planner (SDAR), a task and motion planning (TAMP) framework for tabletop rearrangement, where two robot arms equipped with 2-finger grippers must work together in close proximity to rearrange objects whose start and goal config- urations are strongly entangled. To tackle such challenges, SDAR tightly knit together its dependency-driven task planner (SDAR-T) and synchronous dual-arm motion planner (SDAR- M), to intelligently sift through a large number of possible task and motion plans. Specifically, SDAR-T applies a simple yet effective strategy to decompose the global object dependency graph induced by the rearrangement task, to produce more optimal dual-arm task plans than solutions derived from optimal task plans for a single arm. Leveraging state-of-the-art GPU SIMD-based motion planning tools, SDAR-M employs a layered motion planning strategy to sift through many task plans for the best synchronous dual-arm motion plan while ensuring high levels of success rate. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SDAR delivers a 100% success rate in solving complex, non-monotone, long-horizon tabletop rearrangement tasks with solution quality far exceeding the previous state- of-the-art. Experiments on two UR-5e arms further confirm SDAR directly and reliably transfers to robot hardware.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08233v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans interpret safety not as a binary signal but as a continuous, context- and spatially-dependent notion of risk. While risk is subjective, humans form rational mental models that guide action selection in dynamic environments. This work proposes a framework for extracting implicit human risk models by introducing a novel, semantically-conditioned and spatially-varying parametrization of risk, supervised directly from safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense. Notably, we define risk through a Bayesian formulation. The prior is furnished by a pretrained vision-language model. In order to encourage the risk estimate to be more human aligned, a likelihood function modulates the prior to produce a relative metric of risk. Specifically, the likelihood is a learned ViT that maps pretrained features, to pixel-aligned risk values. Our pipeline ingests RGB images and a query object string, producing pixel-dense risk images. These images that can then be used as value-predictors in robot planning tasks or be projected into 3D for use in conventional trajectory optimization to produce human-like motion. This learned mapping enables generalization to novel objects and contexts, and has the potential to scale to much larger training datasets. In particular, the Bayesian framework that is introduced enables fast adaptation of our model to additional observations or common sense rules. We demonstrate that our proposed framework produces contextual risk that aligns with human preferences. Additionally, we illustrate several downstream applications of the model; as a value learner for visuomotor planners or in conjunction with a classical trajectory optimization algorithm. Our results suggest that our framework is a significant step toward enabling autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08248v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for general control-affine MIMO nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy prescribed time reach-avoid-stay tasks under external disturbances. The STT is defined as a time-varying ball, whose center and radius are jointly approximated by a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The constraints governing the STT are first formulated as loss functions of the PINN, and a training algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall violation. The PINN being trained on certain collocation points, we propose a Lipschitz-based validity condition to formally verify that the learned PINN satisfies the conditions over the continuous time horizon. Building on the learned STT representation, an approximation-free closed-form controller is defined to guarantee satisfaction of the T-RAS specification. Finally, the effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through two case studies involving a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle navigating through cluttered environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Offline decision-making requires synthesizing reliable behaviors from fixed datasets without further interaction, yet existing generative approaches often yield trajectories that are dynamically infeasible. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Finally, we deploy our method on a real quadrupedal robot, showcasing its practicality for real-world control.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08405v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: World models have demonstrated impressive performance on robotic learning tasks. Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs. This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention. A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application). Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE. We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08481v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding how humans respond to uncertainty is critical for designing safe and effective physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), as physically working with robots introduces multiple sources of uncertainty, including trust, comfort, and perceived safety. Conventional pHRI control frameworks typically build on optimal control theory, which assumes that human actions minimize a cost function; however, human behavior under uncertainty often departs from such optimal patterns. To address this gap, additional understanding of human behavior under uncertainty is needed. This pilot study implemented a physically coupled target-reaching task in which the robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10\% to 90\%). Analysis of participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies revealed two distinct behavioral clusters: a "trade-off" group that modulated their physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, and an "always-compensate" group characterized by strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. These findings provide empirical evidence that human decision-making in pHRI is highly individualized and that the perception of probability can differ to its true value. Accordingly, the study highlights the need for more interpretable behavioral models, such as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), to more accurately capture these behaviors and inform the design of future adaptive robot controllers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08518v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social robots must adjust to human proxemic norms to ensure user comfort and engagement. While prior research demonstrates that eye-tracking features reliably estimate comfort in human-human interactions, their applicability to interactions with humanoid robots remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate user comfort with the robot "Ameca" across four experimentally controlled distances (0.5 m to 2.0 m) using mobile eye-tracking and subjective reporting (N=19). We evaluate multiple machine learning and deep learning models to estimate comfort based on gaze features. Contrary to previous human-human studies where Transformer models excelled, a Decision Tree classifier achieved the highest performance (F1-score = 0.73), with minimum pupil diameter identified as the most critical predictor. These findings suggest that physiological comfort thresholds in human-robot interaction differ from human-human dynamics and can be effectively modeled using interpretable logic.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulation offers advantages throughout the development process of automated driving functions, both in research and product development. Common open-source simulators like CARLA are extensively used in training, evaluation, and software-in-the-loop testing of new automated driving algorithms. However, the CARLA simulator lacks an evaluation where research and automated driving vehicles are simulated with their entire sensor and actuation stack in real time. The goal of this work is therefore to create a simulation framework for testing the automation software on its dedicated hardware and identifying its limits. Achieving this goal would greatly benefit the open-source development workflow of automated driving functions, designating CARLA as a consistent evaluation tool along the entire development process. To achieve this goal, in a first step, requirements are derived, and a simulation architecture is specified and implemented. Based on the formulated requirements, the proposed vEDGAR software is evaluated, resulting in a final conclusion on the applicability of CARLA for HiL testing of automated vehicles. The tool is available open source: Modified CARLA fork: https://github.com/TUMFTM/carla, vEDGAR Framework: https://github.com/TUMFTM/vEDGAR

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08548v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent end-to-end robotic manipulation research increasingly adopts architectures inspired by large language models to enable robust manipulation. However, a critical challenge arises from severe distribution shifts between robotic action data, primarily due to substantial numerical variations in action commands across diverse robotic platforms and tasks, hindering the effective transfer of pretrained knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation. Moreover, using the motion representation narrows the feature distance between action tokens and standard vocabulary tokens, mitigating modality gaps. Multi-task experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves generalization performance and transferability in robotic manipulation tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents an approach to mutual collision avoidance based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with time-dependent Reciprocal Velocity Constraints (RVCs). Unlike most existing methods, the proposed approach relies solely on observable information about other robots, eliminating the necessity of excessive communication use. The computationally efficient algorithm for computing RVCs, together with the direct integration of these constraints into NMPC problem formulation on a controller level, allows the whole pipeline to run at 100 Hz. This high processing rate, combined with modeled nonlinear dynamics of the controlled Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is a key feature that facilitates the use of the proposed approach for an agile UAV flight. The proposed approach was evaluated through extensive simulations emulating real-world conditions in scenarios involving up to 10 UAVs and velocities of up to 25 m/s, and in real-world experiments with accelerations up to 30 m/s$^2$. Comparison with state of the art shows 31% improvement in terms of flight time reduction in challenging scenarios, while maintaining a collision-free navigation in all trials.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08580v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans act with context and intention, with reasoning playing a central role. While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning ("mind") with robot action ("hand"). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08630v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates the use of Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization for tuning decentralized trajectory generation algorithms in multi-drone systems. We treat each task as a trajectory generation scenario defined by a specific number of drone-to-drone interactions. To model relationships across scenarios, we employ Multi-Task Gaussian Processes, which capture shared structure across tasks and enable efficient information transfer during optimization. We compare two strategies: optimizing the average mission time across all tasks and optimizing each task individually. Through a comprehensive simulation campaign, we show that single-task optimization leads to progressively shorter mission times as swarm size grows, but requires significantly more optimization time than the average-task approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lidar-based SLAM systems are highly sensitive to adverse conditions such as occlusion, noise, and field-of-view (FoV) degradation, yet existing robustness evaluation methods either lack physical grounding or do not capture sensor-specific behavior. This paper presents a sensor-aware, phenomenological framework for simulating interpretable lidar degradations directly on real point clouds, enabling controlled and reproducible SLAM stress testing. Unlike image-derived corruption benchmarks (e.g., SemanticKITTI-C) or simulation-only approaches (e.g., lidarsim), the proposed system preserves per-point geometry, intensity, and temporal structure while applying structured dropout, FoV reduction, Gaussian noise, occlusion masking, sparsification, and motion distortion. The framework features autonomous topic and sensor detection, modular configuration with four severity tiers (light--extreme), and real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame) compatible with ROS workflows. Experimental validation across three lidar architectures and five state-of-the-art SLAM systems reveals distinct robustness patterns shaped by sensor design and environmental context. The open-source implementation provides a practical foundation for benchmarking lidar-based SLAM under physically meaningful degradation scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08656v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have the hardware ability for agile maneuvering in both translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, due to challenges inherent to underwater vehicles, such as complex hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, parametric uncertainties, and frequent changes in dynamics due to payload changes, control is challenging. Performance typically relies on carefully tuned controllers targeting unique platform configurations, and a need for re-tuning for deployment under varying payloads and hydrodynamic conditions. As a consequence, agile maneuvering with simultaneous tracking of time-varying references in both translational and rotational DOFs is rarely utilized in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first general zero-shot sim2real deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) velocity controller enabling path following and agile 6DOF maneuvering with a training duration of just 3 minutes. Sim2Swim, the proposed approach, inspired by state-of-the-art DRL-based position control, leverages domain randomization and massively parallelized training to converge to field-deployable control policies for AUVs of variable characteristics without post-processing or tuning. Sim2Swim is extensively validated in pool trials for a variety of configurations, showcasing robust control for highly agile motions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08688v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic game formulation for cooperative human-robot navigation in shared workspaces with obstacles, where the human and robot jointly satisfy shared safety constraints while pursuing a common task. A key contribution is the introduction of a non-normalized equilibrium structure for the shared constraints. This structure allows the two agents to contribute different levels of effort towards enforcing safety requirements such as collision avoidance and inter-players spacing. We embed this non-normalized equilibrium into a receding-horizon optimal control scheme.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This report presents a heterogeneous robotic system designed for remote primary triage in mass-casualty incidents (MCIs). The system employs a coordinated air-ground team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to locate victims, assess their injuries, and prioritize medical assistance without risking the lives of first responders. The UAV identify and provide overhead views of casualties, while UGVs equipped with specialized sensors measure vital signs and detect and localize physical injuries. Unlike previous work that focused on exploration or limited medical evaluation, this system addresses the complete triage process: victim localization, vital sign measurement, injury severity classification, mental status assessment, and data consolidation for first responders. Developed as part of the DARPA Triage Challenge, this approach demonstrates how multi-robot systems can augment human capabilities in disaster response scenarios to maximize lives saved.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08767v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Bridging the sim-to-real gap remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, as accurate dynamic parameter estimation is essential for reliable model-based control, realistic simulation, and safe deployment of manipulators. Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging. These results demonstrate that combining Transformers with automated dataset generation and kinematic enrichment enables scalable, accurate dynamic parameter estimation, contributing to improved sim-to-real transfer in robotic systems

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08813v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-robot systems performing continuous tasks face a performance trade-off when interrupted by urgent, time-critical sub-tasks. We investigate this trade-off in a scenario where a team must balance area patrolling with locating an anomalous radio signal. To address this trade-off, we evaluate both behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization ("patrollers" and "searchers") and sensing heterogeneity (i.e., only the searchers can sense the radio signal). Through simulation, we identify the Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying team compositions, with behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrating the most balanced trade-offs in the majority of cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half of the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for restricting sensor payload deployment. Our findings demonstrate that pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks, where varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity can tune system performance toward either task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is commonly deployed in settings where agents are trained via self-play with homogeneous teammates, often using parameter sharing and a single policy architecture. This opens the question: to what extent do self-play PPO agents learn general coordination strategies grounded in the underlying game, compared to overfitting to their training partners' behaviors? This paper investigates the question using the Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge (HeMAC) environment, which features distinct Observer and Drone agents with complementary capabilities. We introduce Rotating Policy Training (RPT), an approach that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, to expose the agent to a broader range of partner strategies. When playing alongside a withheld teammate policy (DDQN), we find that RPT achieves similar performance to a standard self-play baseline, IPPO, where all agents were trained sharing a single PPO policy. This result indicates that in this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, the IPPO baseline generalizes to novel teammate algorithms despite not experiencing teammate diversity during training. This shows that a simple IPPO baseline may possess the level of generalization to novel teammates that a diverse training regimen was designed to achieve.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2512.08920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human video demonstrations provide abundant training data for learning robot policies, but video alone cannot capture the rich contact signals critical for mastering manipulation. We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes. We release complete hardware designs, firmware, and assembly instructions to support community adoption.
