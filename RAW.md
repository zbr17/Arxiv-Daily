- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18935v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored DR algorithms and their application in future research.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19001v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1, a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains) further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception, prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example, using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However, these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features, limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19060v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19078v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19109v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias. This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation, ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19118v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19150v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19182v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos, often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5 years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills, and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis. Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute. In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55% respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual involvement.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19183v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19193v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework. To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance compared to the previous method.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19195v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are $\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19210v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router. Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts, enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/MoE-GS-68BA/.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19215v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection, and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features. Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19220v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19250v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles, offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods, therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available, as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project page:https://mingrui-zhao.github.io/4DRep-GMI/

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19272v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1amddXQ5orIyjbxHgGpzqFHZ6KTolinJF?usp=drive_link and the related code will be published at https://github.com/ARBEZ-ZEBRA/SCEESR.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network (ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action recognition.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However, since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics, thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy (e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark), with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications in early Alzheimer disease detection.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19292v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision, including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding, vision-based systems can identify deviations in task execution, such as incorrect sequencing, use of improper techniques, or timing errors. We explore the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets, evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future directions, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19321v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to 75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift. Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19332v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19333v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage, pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment. Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability of the proposed framework.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19336v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/DaMo.git

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19353v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19371v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality. Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19400v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19432v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19 wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19451v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels: single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person), correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19463v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data, applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios. Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14 dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity. These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets, significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net, which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and competitiveness on general public datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations. This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation, simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control (R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197. Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to 36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for implementing digital rock physics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19472v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image, which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices), including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors (x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm of predictive imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19478v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training. Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19496v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the \emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19527v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19555v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19557v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19559v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space. These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while being computationally efficient.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19560v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos. {\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19578v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19579v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO applications.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19586v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our findings.

We introduce a fully automated, modular framework that converts scanned or photographed ECGs into digital signals, suitable for both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191 ECG images with 1,596 collected at Akershus University Hospital, where the algorithm obtains a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 19.65 dB on scanned papers with common artifacts. It is further evaluated on the Emory Paper Digitization ECG Dataset, comprising 35,595 images, including images with perspective distortion, wrinkles, and stains. The model improves on the state-of-the-art in all subcategories. The full software is released as open-source, promoting reproducibility and further development. We hope the software will contribute to unlocking retrospective ECG archives and democratize access to AI-driven diagnostics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19592v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks. Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19597v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance. To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world deployment.

In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies, their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2) models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated. These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19612v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$ curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients. We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents $\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture. It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with deep convolutional network.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19622v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs. ``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1) it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2) it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness. The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model, while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19626v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However, their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code, checkpoints, and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Leevan001/MedReason-R1

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon, where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally, our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19654v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs. Code and model weights will be released at https://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature) search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19679v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones. Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection (PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19716v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation, enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19760v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts; and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10 systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19789v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance, speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis), as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps. To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions, capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic, coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19802v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts. CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization, refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.

This paper contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth, emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled method to create composite metrics with better human alignment.

Our videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings, with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline. ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity. Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges, particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking algorithms.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse operational contexts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18910v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for (i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions (BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and {Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift; (ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning (CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by 15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings. Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for extreme contamination.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18921v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning (ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research, experimentation, and prototyping.   This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when porting models between frameworks.   Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18924v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards (RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates. Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18925v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18927v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18934v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures -- those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable, and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures. However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former, such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e., connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen. Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here: https://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18989v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost and fast inference of neural operators.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations, thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series. In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with different contamination ratios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000 rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine adapted to specific patient characteristics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19040v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects, undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees (SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19056v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical (BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40% against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19093v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions, particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight decay variant for successful transfer.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19099v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally - the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded, and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices, exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will be released upon publication.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual, dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship, the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual bandits that ignore this trade-off.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19138v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover, real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments, without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19152v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data, there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3) interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent threats.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19155v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results and consistently stronger robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19158v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial), finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm. Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy (locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games, where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting cases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19160v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL) with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex research questions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models. Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference, its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models, these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly. This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19199v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors. This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node distinctiveness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges: the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity', which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate. Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across various vision tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19229v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution. These results position configurations as a principled computational model of early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19236v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful, general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks, but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice, training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19241v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods. Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19244v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method first extracts compact feature representations from image observations, performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19248v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights, we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations, aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1 16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from 0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19257v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting, (ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance. Code is available at https://github.com/sybeam27/FnRGNN.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work, we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability. We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods. Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19290v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification, but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and distribution shift problems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19304v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall: once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19305v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura) by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the "EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification, achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

While calibration often receives less attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28% up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used calibration methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19338v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series, specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0. Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%. Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19345v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast -- point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM), along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset; instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19348v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often solved by Branch and Bound (B&amp;B). A key factor influencing the performance of B&amp;B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions. Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&amp;B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&amp;B, allowing to leverage a broad range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&amp;B heuristics. Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19349v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank $r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer, a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical systems.

In this work, we benchmark recent optimization algorithms for training a diffusion model for denoising flow trajectories. We observe that Muon and SOAP are highly efficient alternatives to AdamW (18% lower final loss). We also revisit several recent phenomena related to the training of models for text or image applications in the context of diffusion model training. This includes the impact of the learning-rate schedule on the training dynamics, and the performance gap between Adam and SGD.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19383v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information. The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this `age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the `age' of the system.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19384v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together, these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise. Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in real-world web environments.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach, existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly, overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue \textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM, CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods, achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge. However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a 80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42 and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19421v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge. Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of FairNet.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19422v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs. Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect, which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed, incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S (sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout} posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification. The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

(2022) suggests that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar. We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict universality.

However, DPO faces a scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster, with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19476v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety. This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19479v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while maintaining the model's utility.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19482v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility. However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19498v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths. However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement, increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate (ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment.

We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19514v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19517v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning (ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g., selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly -- resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges. First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently, Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the world.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19530v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks. Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead, dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19531v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in large-scale MDPs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However, their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training across data silos. This federated data access complicates important data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19611v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making. Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19623v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6% improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster, thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19634v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19640v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace, potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals, leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/idiap/FVAE-LoRA

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19643v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences, which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO) meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones, we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19672v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However, most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR) objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption, connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over a baseline policy with high probability.

We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable. We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting. Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains. Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19728v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19734v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish \emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees, rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta > 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$ memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and conservation efforts.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19753v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an $L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly $3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the degree-based heuristic.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable. However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way, CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19755v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.   Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.   Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19773v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models, limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region) of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19778v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes, intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19796v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to 12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19797v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples, without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$ in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient dimension $d$.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19801v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150 days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures, and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control. Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks, leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18982v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii) the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime -- where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime -- where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms -- sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models corroborate our theoretical findings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18988v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy) that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust framework for preference-based alignment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19055v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving development of more robust AI systems.

This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast, approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19205v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies, providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19263v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model, there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to the generalized notion of the reason model.

We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL), which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19429v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans' implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19562v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks, severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically, we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions. Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities, achieving superior performance to baseline methods.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19631v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.   To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.   Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19661v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19666v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19671v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently, this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature. Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters trust in the outcome predictions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19698v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language, sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19732v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19771v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19788v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data, and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain conditions.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs, has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best, spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18996v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance, SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed approach in full are planned in the very near future.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.18999v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization, mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs. This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{} outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19054v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19058v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty, yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing collision risk.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19068v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s. Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in wearable assistive devices.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19074v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term planning and high-frequency control.

This paper presents a comprehensive development of a mobile manipulator designed to assist human operators in such autonomous lab environments. Kinematic modeling of the manipulator is carried out based on the Denavit Hartenberg (DH) convention and inverse kinematics solution is determined to enable precise and adaptive manipulation capabilities. A key focus of this research is enhancing the manipulator ability to reliably grasp textured objects as a critical component of autonomous handling tasks. Advanced vision-based algorithms are implemented to perform real-time object detection and pose estimation, guiding the manipulator in dynamic grasping and following tasks. In this work, we integrate a vision method that combines feature-based detection with homography-driven pose estimation, leveraging depth information to represent an object pose as a $2$D planar projection within $3$D space. This adaptive capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work contributes to the scalability and reproducibility of next-generation chemical laboratories

However, even legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region and frontier region online from leg-terrain interactions using Gaussian Process regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively estimated traversability in simulation.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines. Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3 (6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world settings.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data. Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9% over existing image-based methods.

These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution. Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands. It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19289v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility, and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous laboratory automation. More information is available at https://tarmac-paper.github.io/

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference. Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19364v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured, off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of 3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation baselines.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19373v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19415v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19495v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world, simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data, without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data for robust policy learning in robotics.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19541v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent prosthetic systems.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19655v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control. LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world deployment.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions, the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency, as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs. Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19752v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

- 摘要: arXiv:2510.19766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.
