- **标题**: Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.04986v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05048v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

- **标题**: Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05059v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.   The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.   These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05073v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

- **标题**: Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.   Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.   The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.   This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05091v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05110v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05113v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05115v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05133v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05143v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05195v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05266v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05287v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05302v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05353v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05354v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05367v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05381v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05403v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05407v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05424v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05429v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05430v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05464v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05472v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05479v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05499v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05544v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05570v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05597v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05599v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05636v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.   Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.   We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.   The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems. All the related resources, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphMemory.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GenLoRA-1519.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05717v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05723v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05748v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

Our results show that while several optimizers yield measurable improvements, simple few-shot bootstrapping is the most consistently effective; however, none of the studied methods matches the performance of a carefully engineered state-of-the-art proof agent.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management. Evaluations reveal that FiMI Base achieves a 20% improvement over the Mistral Small 24B Base model on finance reasoning benchmark, while FiMI Instruct outperforms the Mistral Small 24B Instruct model by 87% on domain-specific tool-calling. Moreover, FiMI achieves these significant domain gains while maintaining comparable performance to models of similar size on general benchmarks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05805v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.

Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&amp;S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&amp;S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&amp;S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&amp;S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.05983v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.06000v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.06008v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.06023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2602.06039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.
