- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00812v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Emotional responses during advertising video viewing are recognized as essential for understanding media effects because they have influenced attention, memory, and purchase intention. To establish a methodological basis for explainable emotion estimation without relying on external information such as physiological signals or subjective ratings, we have quantified "pleasantness," "surprise," and "habituation" solely from scene-level expression features of advertising videos, drawing on the free energy(FE) principle, which has provided a unified account of perception, learning, and behavior. In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected "pleasantness" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured "surprise" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected "surprise" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00829v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative image models have recently shown significant progress in image realism, leading to public concerns about their potential misuse for document forgery. This paper explores whether contemporary open-source and publicly accessible diffusion-based generative models can produce identity document forgeries that could realistically bypass human or automated verification systems. We evaluate text-to-image and image-to-image generation pipelines using multiple publicly available generative model families, including Stable Diffusion, Qwen, Flux, Nano-Banana, and others. The findings indicate that while current generative models can simulate surface-level document aesthetics, they fail to reproduce structural and forensic authenticity. Consequently, the risk of generative identity document deepfakes achieving forensic-level authenticity may be overestimated, underscoring the value of collaboration between machine learning practitioners and document-forensics experts in realistic risk assessment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00837v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, with over 700,000 deaths annually. Accurate diagnosis from chest X-rays is limited by radiologist availability and variability.   Objective: This study compares custom CNNs trained from scratch with transfer learning (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0) for pediatric pneumonia detection, evaluating frozen-backbone and fine-tuning regimes.   Methods: A dataset of 5,216 pediatric chest X-rays was split 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing. Seven models were trained and assessed using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Grad-CAM visualizations provided explainability.   Results: Fine-tuned ResNet50 achieved the best performance: 99.43\% accuracy, 99.61\% F1-score, and 99.93\% AUC, with only 3 misclassifications. Fine-tuning outperformed frozen-backbone models by 5.5 percentage points on average. Grad-CAM confirmed clinically relevant lung regions guided predictions.   Conclusions: Transfer learning with fine-tuning substantially outperforms CNNs trained from scratch for pediatric pneumonia detection, showing near-perfect accuracy. This system has strong potential as a screening tool in resource-limited settings. Future work should validate these findings on multi-center and adult datasets.   Keywords: Pneumonia detection, deep learning, transfer learning, CNN, chest X-ray, pediatric diagnosis, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, Grad-CAM.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00839v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Several review papers summarize cardiac imaging and DL advances, few works connect this overview to a unified and reproducible experimental benchmark. In this study, we combine a focused review of cardiac ultrasound segmentation literature with a controlled comparison of three influential architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet, on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) echocardiography dataset. Our benchmark spans multiple preprocessing routes, including native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) on thousands of unlabeled cine frames. Using identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria, a plain U-Net achieved a 94% mean Dice when trained directly on NIfTI data (preserving native dynamic range), while the PNG-16-bit workflow reached 91% under similar conditions. Attention U-Net provided modest improvements on small or low-contrast regions, reducing boundary leakage, whereas TransUNet demonstrated the strongest generalization on challenging frames due to its ability to model global spatial context, particularly when initialized with SSL. Pseudo-labeling expanded the training set and improved robustness after confidence filtering. Overall, our contributions are threefold: a harmonized, apples-to-apples benchmark of U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet under standardized CAMUS preprocessing and evaluation; practical guidance on maintaining intensity fidelity, resolution consistency, and alignment when preparing ultrasound data; and an outlook on scalable self-supervision and emerging multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines for rapid labeling, quality assurance, and targeted dataset curation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00854v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose Motion-Compensated Latent Semantic Canvases (MCLSC) for visual situational awareness on resource-constrained edge devices. The core idea is to maintain persistent semantic metadata in two latent canvases - a slowly accumulating static layer and a rapidly updating dynamic layer - defined in a baseline coordinate frame stabilized from the video stream. Expensive panoptic segmentation (Mask2Former) runs asynchronously and is motion-gated: inference is triggered only when motion indicates new information, while stabilization/motion compensation preserves a consistent coordinate system for latent semantic memory. On prerecorded 480p clips, our prototype reduces segmentation calls by >30x and lowers mean end-to-end processing time by >20x compared to naive per-frame segmentation, while maintaining coherent static/dynamic semantic overlays.

- **标题**: VL-OrdinalFormer: Vision Language Guided Ordinal Transformers for Interpretable Knee Osteoarthritis Grading
- **作者**: Zahid Ullah, Jihie Kim

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00879v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and accurate severity assessment using the Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grading system is critical for clinical decision making. However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we propose VLOrdinalFormer, a vision language guided ordinal learning framework for fully automated KOA grading from knee radiographs. The proposed method combines a ViT L16 backbone with CORAL based ordinal regression and a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) driven semantic alignment module, allowing the model to incorporate clinically meaningful textual concepts related to joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. To improve robustness and mitigate overfitting, we employ stratified five fold cross validation, class aware re weighting to emphasize challenging intermediate grades, and test time augmentation with global threshold optimization. Experiments conducted on the publicly available OAI kneeKL224 dataset demonstrate that VLOrdinalFormer achieves state of the art performance, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in terms of macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Notably, the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains for KL1 and KL2 without compromising classification accuracy for mild or severe cases. In addition, interpretability analyses using Grad CAM and CLIP similarity maps confirm that the model consistently attends to clinically relevant anatomical regions. These results highlight the potential of vision language aligned ordinal transformers as reliable and interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiological practice.

- **标题**: VideoCuRL: Video Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Orthogonal Difficulty Decomposition

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00887v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for empowering VideoLLMs with complex spatiotemporal reasoning. However, current RL paradigms predominantly rely on random data shuffling or naive curriculum strategies based on scalar difficulty metrics. We argue that scalar metrics fail to disentangle two orthogonal challenges in video understanding: Visual Temporal Perception Load and Cognitive Reasoning Depth. To address this, we propose VideoCuRL, a novel framework that decomposes difficulty into these two axes. We employ efficient, training-free proxies, optical flow and keyframe entropy for visual complexity, Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity, to map data onto a 2D curriculum grid. A competence aware Diagonal Wavefront strategy then schedules training from base alignment to complex reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic Sparse KL and Structured Revisiting to stabilize training against reward collapse and catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that VideoCuRL surpasses strong RL baselines on reasoning (+2.5 on VSI-Bench) and perception (+2.9 on VideoMME) tasks. Notably, VideoCuRL eliminates the prohibitive inference overhead of generation-based curricula, offering a scalable solution for robust video post-training.

- **标题**: Comparative Evaluation of CNN Architectures for Neural Style Transfer in Indonesian Batik Motif Generation: A Comprehensive Study
- **作者**: Happy Gery Pangestu, Andi Prademon Yunus, Siti Khomsah

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00888v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) provides a computational framework for the digital preservation and generative exploration of Indonesian batik motifs; however, existing approaches remain largely centered on VGG-based architectures whose strong stylistic expressiveness comes at the cost of high computational and memory demands, that limits practical deployment in resource-limited environments. This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, and ResNet101, based on 245 controlled experiments combining quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis to examine the trade-off between structural preservation, stylistic behavior, and computational efficiency. The results show that backbone selection does not yield statistically significant differences in structural similarity, as confirmed by ANOVA on SSIM (p= 0.83), indicating comparable levels of structural preservation rather than equivalent stylistic quality. Within this context, ResNet-based architectures achieve approximately 5-6x faster convergence than VGG models while maintaining similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS = 0.53) and requiring over 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs). Qualitative analysis reveals consistent stylistic trade-offs, with VGG producing denser painterly textures, ResNet favoring geometric stability and canting stroke preservation with milder stylization, and Inception V3 exhibiting intermediate but noisier behavior. These findings reposition architectural choice in NST from maximizing stylistic intensity toward efficiency-aware and structure-preserving deployment, highlighting ResNet-based backbones as a practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00897v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate grading of corn kernels is critical for seed certification, directional seeding, and breeding, yet it is still predominantly performed by manual inspection. This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows. Source code and data are publicly available.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00905v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While the importance of efficient recycling is widely acknowledged, accurately determining the recyclability of items and their proper disposal remains a complex task for the general public. In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins. Additionally, we investigated the models' performance across several challenging scenarios: (i) adjusting predictions based on location-specific recycling guidelines; (ii) accounting for contamination or structural damage; and (iii) handling objects composed of multiple materials. Our findings highlight the significant advancements in contextual understanding offered by these models compared to previous iterations, while also identifying areas where they still fall short. The continued refinement of context-aware models is crucial for enhancing public recycling practices and advancing environmental sustainability.

- **标题**: Clean-GS: Semantic Mask-Guided Pruning for 3D Gaussian Splatting
- **作者**: Subhankar Mishra
- **发布时间**: 2026-01-06
- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00913
- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00913v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting produces high-quality scene reconstructions but generates hundreds of thousands of spurious Gaussians (floaters) scattered throughout the environment. These artifacts obscure objects of interest and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications. We present Clean-GS, a method for removing background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks. Our approach combines whitelist-based spatial filtering with color-guided validation and outlier removal to achieve 60-80\% model compression while preserving object quality. Unlike existing 3DGS pruning methods that rely on global importance metrics, Clean-GS uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1\% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to the target object. Our multi-stage approach consisting of (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal isolates monuments and objects from complex outdoor scenes. Experiments on Tanks and Temples show that Clean-GS reduces file sizes from 125MB to 47MB while maintaining rendering quality, making 3DGS models practical for web deployment and AR/VR applications.

- **标题**: Four-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Classification from MRI Using Topological Feature Extraction, Feature Selection, and Ensemble Learning

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00918v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate and efficient classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a critical challenge, particularly when limited data and model interpretability are of concern. In this work, we propose TDA-Alz, a novel framework for four-stage Alzheimer's disease severity classification (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild, and very mild) using topological data analysis (TDA) and ensemble learning. Instead of relying on deep convolutional architectures or extensive data augmentation, our approach extracts topological descriptors that capture intrinsic structural patterns of brain MRI, followed by feature selection to retain the most discriminative topological features. These features are then classified using an ensemble learning strategy to achieve robust multiclass discrimination.   Experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.19% and an AUC of 99.75%, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art deep learning--based methods reported on OASIS and OASIS-derived datasets. Notably, the proposed framework does not require data augmentation, pretrained networks, or large-scale computational resources, making it computationally efficient and fast compared to deep neural network approaches. Furthermore, the use of topological descriptors provides greater interpretability, as the extracted features are directly linked to the underlying structural characteristics of brain MRI rather than opaque latent representations. These results indicate that TDA-Alz offers a powerful, lightweight, and interpretable alternative to deep learning models for MRI-based Alzheimer's disease severity classification, with strong potential for real-world clinical decision-support systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00925v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening disease, early detection and treatment can significantly reduce mortality. In recent years, many studies have been using deep learning in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with contrast medium computed tomography pulmonary angiography, but the contrast medium is likely to cause acute kidney injury in patients with pulmonary embolism and chronic kidney disease, and the contrast medium takes time to work, patients with acute pulmonary embolism may miss the golden treatment time.   This study aims to use deep learning techniques to automatically classify pulmonary embolism in CT images without contrast medium by using a 3D convolutional neural network model. The deep learning model used in this study had a significant impact on the pulmonary embolism classification of computed tomography images without contrast with 85\% accuracy and 0.84 AUC, which confirms the feasibility of the model in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00928v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Motivated by recent challenges in the deployment of robots into customer-facing roles within retail, this work introduces a study of customer activity in physical stores as a step toward autonomous understanding of shopper intent. We introduce an algorithm that computes shoppers' ``shelf visits'' -- capturing their browsing behavior in the store. Shelf visits are extracted from trajectories obtained via machine vision-based 3D tracking and overhead cameras. We perform two independent calibrations of the shelf visit algorithm, using distinct sets of trajectories (consisting of 8138 and 15129 trajectories), collected in different stores and labeled by human reviewers. The calibrated models are then evaluated on trajectories held out of the calibration process both from the same store on which calibration was performed and from the other store. An analysis of the results shows that the algorithm can recognize customers' browsing activity when evaluated in an environment different from the one on which calibration was performed. We then use the model to analyze the customers' ``browsing patterns'' on a large set of trajectories and their relation to actual purchases in the stores. Finally, we discuss how shelf browsing information could be used for retail planning and in the domain of human-robot interaction scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00939v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a novel paradigm for 3D reconstruction from satellite imagery. However, in multi-temporal satellite images, prevalent shadows exhibit significant inconsistencies due to varying illumination conditions. To address this, we propose ShadowGS, a novel framework based on 3DGS. It leverages a physics-based rendering equation from remote sensing, combined with an efficient ray marching technique, to precisely model geometrically consistent shadows while maintaining efficient rendering. Additionally, it effectively disentangles different illumination components and apparent attributes in the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a shadow consistency constraint that significantly enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D reconstruction. We also incorporate a novel shadow map prior to improve performance with sparse-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShadowGS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in shadow decoupling accuracy, 3D reconstruction precision, and novel view synthesis quality, with only a few minutes of training. ShadowGS exhibits robust performance across various settings, including RGB, pansharpened, and sparse-view satellite inputs.

- **链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00940
- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Different types of liquids such as water, wine and medicine appear in all aspects of daily life. However, limited attention has been given to the task, hindering the ability of robots to avoid or interact with liquids safely. The segmentation of liquids is difficult because liquids come in diverse appearances and shapes; moreover, they can be both transparent or reflective, taking on arbitrary objects and scenes from the background or surroundings. To take on this challenge, we construct a large-scale dataset of liquids named LQDS consisting of 5000 real-world images annotated into 14 distinct classes, and design a novel liquid detection model named LQDM, which leverages cross-attention between a dedicated boundary branch and the main segmentation branch to enhance segmentation predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LQDM on the test set of LQDS, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and establishing a strong baseline for the semantic segmentation of liquids.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative AI models, particularly Text-to-Video (T2V) systems, offer a promising avenue for transforming science education by automating the creation of engaging and intuitive visual explanations. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating their potential in physics education by introducing a dedicated benchmark for explanatory video generation. The benchmark is designed to assess how well T2V models can convey core physics concepts through visual illustrations. Each physics concept in our benchmark is decomposed into granular teaching points, with each point accompanied by a carefully crafted prompt intended for visual explanation of the teaching point. T2V models are evaluated on their ability to generate accurate videos in response to these prompts. Our aim is to systematically explore the feasibility of using T2V models to generate high-quality, curriculum-aligned educational content-paving the way toward scalable, accessible, and personalized learning experiences powered by AI. Our evaluation reveals that current models produce visually coherent videos with smooth motion and minimal flickering, yet their conceptual accuracy is less reliable. Performance in areas such as mechanics, fluids, and optics is encouraging, but models struggle with electromagnetism and thermodynamics, where abstract interactions are harder to depict. These findings underscore the gap between visual quality and conceptual correctness in educational video generation. We hope this benchmark helps the community close that gap and move toward T2V systems that can deliver accurate, curriculum-aligned physics content at scale. The benchmark and accompanying codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/meghamariamkm/PhyEduVideo.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep clustering - joint representation learning and latent space clustering - is a well studied problem especially in computer vision and text processing under the deep learning framework. While the representation learning is generally differentiable, clustering is an inherently discrete optimization task, requiring various approximations and regularizations to fit in a standard differentiable pipeline. This leads to a somewhat disjointed representation learning and clustering. In this work, we propose a novel loss function utilizing energy-based dynamics via Associative Memories to formulate a new deep clustering method, DCAM, which ties together the representation learning and clustering aspects more intricately in a single objective. Our experiments showcase the advantage of DCAM, producing improved clustering quality for various architecture choices (convolutional, residual or fully-connected) and data modalities (images or text).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00964v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Skin cancer is also one of the most common and dangerous types of cancer in the world that requires timely and precise diagnosis. In this paper, a deep-learning architecture of the multi-class skin lesion classification on the HAM10000 dataset will be described. The system suggested combines high-quality data balancing methods, large-scale data augmentation, hybridized EfficientNetV2-L framework with channel attention, and a three-stage progressive learning approach. Moreover, we also use explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Grad-CAM and saliency maps to come up with intelligible visual representations of model predictions. Our strategy is with a total accuracy of 91.15 per cent, macro F1 of 85.45\% and micro-average AUC of 99.33\%. The model has shown high performance in all the seven lesion classes with specific high performance of melanoma and melanocytic nevi. In addition to enhancing diagnostic transparency, XAI also helps to find out the visual characteristics that cause the classifications, which enhances clinical trustworthiness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00988v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a novel FSVOS model that employs a local matching strategy to restrict the search space to the most relevant neighboring pixels. Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00991v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diverse, accurately labeled 3D human pose data is expensive and studio-bound, while in-the-wild datasets lack known ground truth. We introduce UnrealPose-Gen, an Unreal Engine 5 pipeline built on Movie Render Queue for high-quality offline rendering. Our generated frames include: (i) 3D joints in world and camera coordinates, (ii) 2D projections and COCO-style keypoints with occlusion and joint-visibility flags, (iii) person bounding boxes, and (iv) camera intrinsics and extrinsics. We use UnrealPose-Gen to present UnrealPose-1M, an approximately one million frame corpus comprising eight sequences: five scripted "coherent" sequences spanning five scenes, approximately 40 actions, and five subjects; and three randomized sequences across three scenes, approximately 100 actions, and five subjects, all captured from diverse camera trajectories for broad viewpoint coverage. As a fidelity check, we report real-to-synthetic results on four tasks: image-to-3D pose, 2D keypoint detection, 2D-to-3D lifting, and person detection/segmentation. Though time and resources constrain us from an unlimited dataset, we release the UnrealPose-1M dataset, as well as the UnrealPose-Gen pipeline to support third-party generation of human pose data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wildlife monitoring is crucial for studying biodiversity loss and climate change. Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions. We evaluate WildIng on two datasets collected from different regions, namely America and Africa. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Julian075/CATALOG/tree/WildIng.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown strong promise across visual grounding (VG) tasks. However, existing RS VG datasets predominantly rely on explicit referring expressions-such as relative position, relative size, and color cues-thereby constraining performance on implicit VG tasks that require scenario-specific domain knowledge. This article introduces DVGBench, a high-quality implicit VG benchmark for drones, covering six major application scenarios: traffic, disaster, security, sport, social activity, and productive activity. Each object provides both explicit and implicit queries. Based on the dataset, we design DroneVG-R1, an LVLM that integrates the novel Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. This enables the model to take advantage of scene-specific expertise, converting implicit references into explicit ones and thus reducing grounding difficulty. Finally, an evaluation of mainstream models on both explicit and implicit VG tasks reveals substantial limitations in their reasoning capabilities. These findings provide actionable insights for advancing the reasoning capacity of LVLMs for drone-based agents. The code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/zytx121/DVGBench

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01002v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become integral to modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs), delivering notable performance improvements with minimal computational overhead. However, the efficiency accuracy trade off of different channel attention designs remains underexplored. This work presents an empirical study comparing Squeeze and Excitation (SE), Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), and a proposed Lite Channel Attention (LCA) module across ResNet 18 and MobileNetV2 architectures on CIFAR 10. LCA employs adaptive one dimensional convolutions with grouped operations to reduce parameter usage while preserving effective attention behavior. Experimental results show that LCA achieves competitive accuracy, reaching 94.68 percent on ResNet 18 and 93.10 percent on MobileNetV2, while matching ECA in parameter efficiency and maintaining favorable inference latency. Comprehensive benchmarks including FLOPs, parameter counts, and GPU latency measurements are provided, offering practical insights for deploying attention enhanced CNNs in resource constrained environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01024v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced and show strong promise for text-based person search (TBPS), a task that requires capturing fine-grained relationships between images and text to distinguish individuals. Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01026v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a reproducible deep learning pipeline for leukemic cell classification, focusing on system architecture, experimental robustness, and software design choices for medical image analysis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, requiring expert microscopic diagnosis that suffers from inter-observer variability and time constraints. The proposed system integrates an attention-based convolutional neural network combining EfficientNetV2-B3 with Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanisms for automated ALL cell classification. Our approach employs comprehensive data augmentation, focal loss for class imbalance, and patient-wise data splitting to ensure robust and reproducible evaluation. On the C-NMC 2019 dataset (12,528 original images from 62 patients), the system achieves a 97.89% F1-score and 97.89% accuracy on the test set, with statistical validation through 100-iteration Monte Carlo experiments confirming significant improvements (p < 0.001) over baseline methods. The proposed pipeline outperforms existing approaches by up to 4.67% while using 89% fewer parameters than VGG16 (15.2M vs. 138M). The attention mechanism provides interpretable visualizations of diagnostically relevant cellular features, demonstrating that modern attention-based architectures can improve leukemic cell classification while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01036v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While DETR-like architectures have demonstrated significant potential for monocular 3D object detection, they are often hindered by a critical limitation: the exclusion of 3D attributes from the bipartite matching process. This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance. Without leveraging any external data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01041v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deepfake detection still faces significant challenges in cross-dataset and real-world complex scenarios. The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01044v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computer vision provides automated, non-invasive, and scalable tools for monitoring dairy cattle, thereby supporting management, health assessment, and phenotypic data collection. Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose EgoGrasp, the first method to reconstruct world-space hand-object interactions (W-HOI) from egocentric monocular videos with dynamic cameras in the wild. Accurate W-HOI reconstruction is critical for understanding human behavior and enabling applications in embodied intelligence and virtual reality. However, existing hand-object interactions (HOI) methods are limited to single images or camera coordinates, failing to model temporal dynamics or consistent global trajectories. Some recent approaches attempt world-space hand estimation but overlook object poses and HOI constraints. Their performance also suffers under severe camera motion and frequent occlusions common in egocentric in-the-wild videos. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage framework with a robust pre-process pipeline built on newly developed spatial intelligence models, a whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models, and a multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm. Our HOI prior model is template-free and scalable to multiple objects. In experiments, we prove our method achieving state-of-the-art performance in W-HOI reconstruction.

This study evaluates the classification performance of machine learning and deep learning models on the LC25000 dataset, which includes five classes of histopathological images. We used the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 network both as a classifier and for feature extraction. Our results show that the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 achieved a classification accuracy of 96.01\% and an average AUC of 96.8\%. Models trained on deep features from InceptionResNet-v2 outperformed those using only the pre-trained network, with the Neural Network model achieving an AUC of 99.99\% and accuracy of 99.84\%. Evaluating model robustness under varying SNR conditions revealed that models using deep features exhibited greater resilience, particularly GBM and KNN. The combination of HOG and deep features showed enhanced performance, however, less so in noisy environments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01064v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is essential across various disciplines for its capacity to capture rich spectral information. However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01085v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{Luminark}, a training-free and probabilistically-certified watermarking method for general vision generative models. Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on nine models spanning diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks. Across all evaluations, Luminark consistently demonstrates high detection accuracy, strong robustness against common image transformations, and good performance on visual quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01095v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language reasoning, yet their ability to understand temporally unfolding narratives in videos remains underexplored. True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts. These findings uncover a fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning, indicating that narrative understanding emerges only from their integration. NarrativeTrack provides the first systematic framework to diagnose and advance temporally grounded narrative comprehension in MLLMs.

The datasets span binary classification, fine-grained multiclass recognition, and object detection scenarios. We analyze how architectural factors, such as network depth, residual connections, and feature extraction strategies, influence classification and localization performance. The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes. Building upon a systematic analysis of custom CNN architectures alongside pretrained and transfer learning models, this study provides practical guidance for selecting suitable network designs based on task complexity and resource constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present HAQAGen, a unified generative model for resolution-invariant NIR-to-RGB colorization that balances chromatic realism with structural fidelity. The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods. HAQAGen produces images with sharper textures, natural colors, attaining significant gains as per perceptual metrics. These results position HAQAGen as a scalable and effective solution for NIR-to-RGB translation across diverse imaging scenarios. Project Page: https://rajeev-dw9.github.io/HAQAGen/

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01167v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and it requires high-resolution feature maps for dense prediction. Current coordinate-guided low-resolution feature interpolation methods, e.g., bilinear interpolation, produce coarse high-resolution features which suffer from feature misalignment and insufficient context information. Moreover, enriching semantics to high-resolution features requires a high computation burden, so that it is challenging to meet the requirement of lowlatency inference. We propose a novel Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) method to adaptively interpolate fine-grained high-resolution features with semantic features to tackle these issues. Guided Attentive Interpolation determines both spatial and semantic relations of pixels from features of different resolutions and then leverages these relations to interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics. GAI can be integrated with any deep convolutional network for efficient semantic segmentation. In experiments, the GAI-based semantic segmentation networks, i.e., GAIN, can achieve78.8 mIoU with 22.3 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.6 mIoU with 64.5 on CamVid using an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, which are the new state-of-the-art results of low-latency semantic segmentation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01176v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Introduction: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) arises from diverse comorbidities and progresses through prolonged subclinical stages, making early diagnosis and prognosis difficult. Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models.   Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset.   Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups.   Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions. The approach offers a foundation for integrating diagnostic and prognostic modelling in preclinical HFpEF research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01181v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conceal dense prediction (CDP), especially RGB-D camouflage object detection and open-vocabulary camouflage object segmentation, plays a crucial role in advancing the understanding and reasoning of complex camouflage scenes. However, high-quality and large-scale camouflage datasets with dense annotation remain scarce due to expensive data collection and labeling costs. To address this challenge, we explore leveraging generative models to synthesize realistic camouflage image-dense data for training CDP models with fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, and auxiliary reasoning. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce GenCAMO-DB, a large-scale camouflage dataset with multi-modal annotations, including depth maps, scene graphs, attribute descriptions, and text prompts; (ii) we present GenCAMO, an environment-aware and mask-free generative framework that produces high-fidelity camouflage image-dense annotations; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that GenCAMO significantly improves dense prediction performance on complex camouflage scenes by providing high-quality synthetic data. The code and datasets will be released after paper acceptance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task aiming to estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01200v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds poses a significant challenge for objective quality assessment (PCQA), particularly in establishing accurate perceptual feature correspondence. To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01202v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to recover high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Unlike SISR, Reference-based Super-Resolution (RefSR) leverages an additional high-resolution reference image to facilitate the recovery of high-frequency textures. However, existing research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, while the vulnerability of the adversarial attacks targeting RefSR has not been fully explored. To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw. This study reveals a security vulnerability in RefSR systems, aiming to urge researchers to pay attention to the robustness of RefSR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have benefited substantially from large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention for strong streaming reconstruction, but suffers from unbounded KV cache growth, leading to escalating memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. We propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that systematically compresses the KV cache through joint pruning and quantization, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs originating from multi-view inputs are pruned through efficient token importance identification, enabling a fixed memory budget. Leveraging the unique distribution of KV tensors, we incorporate KV quantization to further reduce memory consumption. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\times$, enabling scalable and practical streaming 3D applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/XStreamVGGT/.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01210v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To realize low-latency spatial transmission system for immersive telepresence, there are two major problems: capturing dynamic 3D scene densely and processing them in real time. LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than a recent training-based depth completion approach. The resulting dense point clouds exhibit accurate geometry without multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Remote sensing solutions for avalanche segmentation and mapping are key to supporting risk forecasting and mitigation in mountain regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01222v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present UniSH, a unified, feed-forward framework for joint metric-scale 3D scene and human reconstruction. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of large-scale, annotated real-world data, forcing a reliance on synthetic datasets. This reliance introduces a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos. To address this, we propose an innovative training paradigm that effectively leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data. Our framework bridges strong, disparate priors from scene reconstruction and HMR, and is trained with two core components: (1) a robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details by distilling high-frequency details from an expert depth model, and (2) a two-stage supervision scheme, which first learns coarse localization on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data by directly optimizing the geometric correspondence between the SMPL mesh and the human point cloud. This approach enables our feed-forward model to jointly recover high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent, metric-scale SMPL bodies, all in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Solving image reconstruction problems of the form \(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}\) remains challenging due to ill-posedness and the lack of large-scale supervised datasets. Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models have been used successfully but typically require supervised pairs \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\). In many practical settings, only measurements \(\mathbf{y}\) are available. We introduce HyDRA (Hybrid Denoising Regularization Adaptation), a measurement-only framework for DEQ training that combines measurement consistency with an adaptive denoising regularization term, together with a data-driven early stopping criterion. Experiments on sparse-view CT demonstrate competitive reconstruction quality and fast inference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01240v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in training dense object detectors. State-of-the-art methods typically assign each training sample a positive and a negative weight, optimizing the assignment scheme during training. However, these strategies often assign an insufficient number of positive samples to small objects, leading to a scale imbalance during training. To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. Notably, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with RFAssigner achieves state-of-the-art performance across all object scales, consistently outperforming existing strategies without requiring auxiliary modules or heuristics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01260v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world clinical applications is constrained by the fundamental trade-off between computational cost and the efficiency of linear-time models. To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed MambaFormer outperforms (BERTScore = 0.9180) with ultra-low latency (0.077 s), delivering a 24.4 speedup over T5-Large and establishing a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires balancing local precision for boundary-critical clinical applications, global context for anatomical coherence, and computational efficiency for deployment on limited data and hardware a trilemma that existing architectures fail to resolve. Although convolutional networks provide local precision at $\mathcal{O}(n)$ cost but limited receptive fields, vision transformers achieve global context through $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ self-attention at prohibitive computational expense, causing overfitting on small clinical datasets. We propose S2M-Net, a 4.7M-parameter architecture that achieves $\mathcal{O}(HW \log HW)$ global context through two synergistic innovations: (i) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM), which exploits the spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, avoiding quadratic attention cost while maintaining global receptive fields; and (ii) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL), which automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning. Comprehensive evaluation in 16 medical imaging datasets that span 8 modalities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: 96.12\% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77\% on surgical instruments (+17.85\% over the prior art) and 80.90\% on brain tumors, with consistent 3-18\% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5--6$\times$ fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.

To study this regime, we introduce VReID-XFD, a video-based benchmark and community challenge for extreme far-distance (XFD) aerial-to-ground person re-identification. VReID-XFD is derived from the DetReIDX dataset and comprises 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75 million frames, captured across altitudes from 5.8 m to 120 m, viewing angles from oblique (30 degrees) to nadir (90 degrees), and horizontal distances up to 120 m. The benchmark supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation under strict identity-disjoint splits, with rich physical metadata. The VReID-XFD-25 Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions. Systematic analysis reveals monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, a universal disadvantage of nadir views, and a trade-off between peak performance and robustness. Even the best-performing SAS-PReID method achieves only 43.93 percent mAP in the aerial-to-ground setting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01322v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding neural responses to visual stimuli remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of brain representations and the modality gap between neural data and visual inputs. Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01352v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Producing prompt-faithful videos that preserve a user-specified identity remains challenging: models need to extrapolate facial dynamics from sparse reference while balancing the tension between identity preservation and motion naturalness. Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and "average" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in intelligent surveillance systems by linking identities across multiple cameras in complex environments. However, ReID faces significant challenges such as appearance variations, domain shifts, and limited labeled data. This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID. By integrating global and local attention with camera identity constraints, this method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on large-scale benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluations across CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The contributions advance ReID research by addressing key limitations in feature learning, domain adaptation, and label noise handling, paving the way for robust deployment in real-world surveillance systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01360v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wearable inertial motion capture (MoCap) provides a portable, occlusion-free, and privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based systems, but its accuracy depends on tightly attached sensors - an intrusive and uncomfortable requirement for daily use. Embedding IMUs into loose-fitting garments is a desirable alternative, yet sensor-body displacement introduces severe, structured, and location-dependent corruption that breaks standard inertial pipelines. We propose GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser), a lightweight, plug-and-play Transformer that factorizes loose-wear MoCap into three stages: (i) location-specific denoising, (ii) adaptive cross-wear fusion, and (iii) general pose prediction. GID uses a location-aware expert architecture, where a shared spatio-temporal backbone models global motion while per-IMU expert heads specialize in local garment dynamics, and a lightweight fusion module ensures cross-part consistency. This inductive bias enables stable training and effective learning from limited paired loose-tight IMU data. We also introduce GarMoCap, a combined public and newly collected dataset covering diverse users, motions, and garments. Experiments show that GID enables accurate, real-time denoising from single-user training and generalizes across unseen users, motions, and garment types, consistently improving state-of-the-art inertial MoCap methods when used as a drop-in module.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01364v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides direct 3D visualization of macromolecules inside the cell, enabling analysis of their in situ morphology. This morphology can be regarded as an SE(3)-invariant, denoised volumetric representation of subvolumes extracted from tomograms. Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies. Experiments on simulated and real cryo-ET datasets demonstrate clear improvements over prior methods, including the discovery of previously unidentified macromolecular morphologies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01386v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parking is a critical task for autonomous driving systems (ADS), with unique challenges in crowded parking slots and GPS-denied environments. However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CustomCNN) created to study how architectural design choices affect multi-domain image classification tasks. The network uses residual connections, Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanisms, progressive channel scaling, and Kaiming initialization to improve its ability to represent data and speed up training. The model is trained and tested on five publicly available datasets: unauthorized vehicle detection, footpath encroachment detection, polygon-annotated road damage and manhole detection, MangoImageBD and PaddyVarietyBD. A comparison with popular CNN architectures shows that the CustomCNN delivers competitive performance while remaining efficient in computation. The results underscore the importance of thoughtful architectural design for real-world Smart City and agricultural imaging applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face super-resolution aims to recover high-quality facial images from severely degraded low-resolution inputs, but remains challenging due to the loss of fine structural details and identity-specific features. This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face Attribute Recognition (FAR) plays a crucial role in applications such as person re-identification, face retrieval, and face editing. Conventional multi-task attribute recognition methods often process the entire feature map for feature extraction and attribute classification, which can produce redundant features due to reliance on global regions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach emphasizing the selection of specific feature regions for efficient feature learning. We introduce the Mask-Guided Multi-Task Network (MGMTN), which integrates Adaptive Mask Learning (AML) and Group-Global Feature Fusion (G2FF) to address the aforementioned limitations. Leveraging a pre-trained keypoint annotation model and a fully convolutional network, AML accurately localizes critical facial parts (e.g., eye and mouth groups) and generates group masks that delineate meaningful feature regions, thereby mitigating negative transfer from global region usage. Furthermore, G2FF combines group and global features to enhance FAR learning, enabling more precise attribute identification. Extensive experiments on two challenging facial attribute recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MGMTN in improving FAR performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01416v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite notable advancements in remote sensing vision-language models (VLMs), existing models often struggle with spatial understanding, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. To push the boundaries of VLMs in remote sensing, we specifically address vehicle imagery captured by drones and introduce a spatially-aware dataset AirSpatial, which comprises over 206K instructions and introduces two novel tasks: Spatial Grounding and Spatial Question Answering. It is also the first remote sensing grounding dataset to provide 3DBB. To effectively leverage existing image understanding of VLMs to spatial domains, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising Image Understanding Pre-training and Spatial Understanding Fine-tuning. Utilizing this trained spatially-aware VLM, we develop an aerial agent, AirSpatialBot, which is capable of fine-grained vehicle attribute recognition and retrieval. By dynamically integrating task planning, image understanding, spatial understanding, and task execution capabilities, AirSpatialBot adapts to diverse query requirements. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing the spatial limitations of existing VLMs while providing valuable insights.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01425v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video Face Swapping (VFS) requires seamlessly injecting a source identity into a target video while meticulously preserving the original pose, expression, lighting, background, and dynamic information. Existing methods struggle to maintain identity similarity and attribute preservation while preserving temporal consistency. To address the challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework to seamlessly transfer the superiority of Image Face Swapping (IFS) to the video domain. We first introduce a novel data pipeline SyncID-Pipe that pre-trains an Identity-Anchored Video Synthesizer and combines it with IFS models to construct bidirectional ID quadruplets for explicit supervision. Building upon paired data, we propose the first Diffusion Transformer-based framework DreamID-V, employing a core Modality-Aware Conditioning module to discriminatively inject multi-model conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a Synthetic-to-Real Curriculum mechanism and an Identity-Coherence Reinforcement Learning strategy to enhance visual realism and identity consistency under challenging scenarios. To address the issue of limited benchmarks, we introduce IDBench-V, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing diverse scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate DreamID-V outperforms state-of-the-art methods and further exhibits exceptional versatility, which can be seamlessly adapted to various swap-related tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01431v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve remarkable performance in dense multi-view scenarios, but their reconstruction quality degrades significantly under sparse inputs due to geometric artifacts. Existing methods utilize global depth regularization to mitigate artifacts, leading to the loss of geometric boundary details. To address this problem, we propose EdgeNeRF, an edge-guided sparse-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method leverages the prior that abrupt changes in depth and normals generate edges. Specifically, we first extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization constraints to non-edge regions, enhancing geometric consistency while preserving high-frequency details at boundaries. Experiments on LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate EdgeNeRF's superior performance, particularly in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Additionally, the proposed edge-guided depth regularization module can be seamlessly integrated into other methods in a plug-and-play manner, significantly improving their performance without substantially increasing training time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (OSDA-SS) presents a significant challenge, as it requires both domain adaptation for known classes and the distinction of unknowns. Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage. We question this design, as the annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes often leads to negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns. To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial advancement, with a +3.85% H-Score improvement for GTA5-to-Cityscapes and +18.64% for SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01454v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To address the scarcity of high-quality part annotations in existing datasets, we introduce PartImageNet++ (PIN++), a dataset that provides detailed part annotations for all categories in ImageNet-1K. With 100 annotated images per category, totaling 100K images, PIN++ represents the most comprehensive dataset covering a diverse range of object categories. Leveraging PIN++, we propose a Multi-scale Part-supervised recognition Model (MPM) for robust classification on ImageNet-1K. We first trained a part segmentation network using PIN++ and used it to generate pseudo part labels for the remaining unannotated images. MPM then integrated a conventional recognition architecture with auxiliary bypass layers, jointly supervised by both pseudo part labels and the original part annotations. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on PIN++, including part segmentation, object segmentation, and few-shot learning, exploring various ways to leverage part annotations in downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach not only enhanced part-based models for robust object recognition but also established strong baselines for multiple downstream tasks, highlighting the potential of part annotations in improving model performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01456v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we revisit multimodal few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-PCS), identifying a conflict in "Fuse-then-Refine" paradigms: the "Plasticity-Stability Dilemma." In addition, CLIP's inter-class confusion can result in semantic blindness. To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation. We also propose a Stacked Arbitration Module (SAM) to perform convolutional fusion and arbitrate correlations for each modality pathway. The Parallel Experts decouple two paths: a Geometric Expert maintains plasticity, and a Semantic Expert ensures stability. They are coordinated via a Decoupled Alignment Module (DAM) that transfers knowledge without propagating confusion. Experiments on popular datasets (S3DIS, ScanNet) demonstrate the superiority of DA-FSS over MM-FSS. Meanwhile, geometric boundaries, completeness, and texture differentiation are all superior to the baseline. The code is available at: https://github.com/MoWenQAQ/DA-FSS.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01457v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Relative-depth foundation models transfer well, yet monocular metric depth remains ill-posed due to unidentifiable global scale and heightened domain-shift sensitivity. Under a frozen-backbone calibration setting, we recover metric depth via an image-specific affine transform in inverse depth and train only lightweight calibration heads while keeping the relative-depth backbone and the CLIP text encoder fixed. Since captions provide coarse but noisy scale cues that vary with phrasing and missing objects, we use language to predict an uncertainty-aware envelope that bounds feasible calibration parameters in an unconstrained space, rather than committing to a text-only point estimate. We then use pooled multi-scale frozen visual features to select an image-specific calibration within this envelope. During training, a closed-form least-squares oracle in inverse depth provides per-image supervision for learning the envelope and the selected calibration. Experiments on NYUv2 and KITTI improve in-domain accuracy, while zero-shot transfer to SUN-RGBD and DDAD demonstrates improved robustness over strong language-only baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01460v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively used in medical imaging applications, assuming that the test and training datasets belong to the same probability distribution. However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01481v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust real time detection and tracking method for detecting ships in a coastal video sequences. Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background. Based on geometrical properties of ship and some concepts such as brightness distortion, a new method for backwash cancellation is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy and methods have outstanding performance in ship detection and tracking. These results also illustrate real time and precise performance of the proposed strategy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling typically trains separate generation and verification models, incurring high training and inference costs. We propose Advantage Decoupled Preference Optimization (ADPO), a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly learns answer generation and self-verification within a single policy. ADPO introduces two innovations: a preference verification reward improving verification capability and a decoupled optimization mechanism enabling synergistic optimization of generation and verification. Specifically, the preference verification reward computes mean verification scores from positive and negative samples as decision thresholds, providing positive feedback when prediction correctness aligns with answer correctness. Meanwhile, the advantage decoupled optimization computes separate advantages for generation and verification, applies token masks to isolate gradients, and combines masked GRPO objectives, preserving generation quality while calibrating verification scores. ADPO achieves up to +34.1% higher verification AUC and -53.5% lower inference time, with significant gains of +2.8%/+1.4% accuracy on MathVista/MMMU, +1.9 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and +1.7%/+1.0% step success rate on AndroidControl/GUI Odyssey.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01485v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite progress in deep learning for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostics, models trained on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) often do not perform well when applied to new cohorts due to domain shifts from varying scanners, protocols and patient demographics. AD, the primary driver of dementia, manifests through progressive cognitive and neuroanatomical changes like atrophy and ventricular expansion, making robust, generalizable classification essential for real-world use. While convolutional neural networks and transformers have advanced feature extraction via attention and fusion techniques, single-domain generalization (SDG) remains underexplored yet critical, given the fragmented nature of AD datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce Extended MixStyle (EM), a framework for blending higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations. Trained on sMRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n=4,647) to differentiate persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126), EM yields enhanced cross-domain performance, improving macro-F1 on average by 2.4 percentage points over state-of-the-art SDG benchmarks, underscoring its promise for invariant, reliable AD detection in heterogeneous real-world settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01487v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion inversion is a task of recovering the noise of an image in a diffusion model, which is vital for controllable diffusion image editing. At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step. The extensive experiments show that our DeepInv can achieve much better performance and inference speed than the compared methods, e.g., +40.435% SSIM than EasyInv and +9887.5% speed than ReNoise on COCO dataset. Moreover, our careful designs of trainable solvers can also provide insights to the community. Codes and model parameters will be released in https://github.com/potato-kitty/DeepInv.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01507v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurately predicting the upgrade of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is crucial for surgical planning. However, traditional deep learning methods face challenges due to limited ultrasound data and poor generalization ability. This study proposes the DiffKD-DCIS framework, integrating conditional diffusion modeling with teacher-student knowledge distillation.   The framework operates in three stages: First, a conditional diffusion model generates high-fidelity ultrasound images using multimodal conditions for data augmentation. Then, a deep teacher network extracts robust features from both original and synthetic data. Finally, a compact student network learns from the teacher via knowledge distillation, balancing generalization and computational efficiency.   Evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 1,435 cases, the synthetic images were of good quality. The student network had fewer parameters and faster inference. On external test sets, it outperformed partial combinations, and its accuracy was comparable to senior radiologists and superior to junior ones, showing significant clinical potential.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01513v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual reasoning but still struggle with integrating external knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x. Our framework highlights the potential of combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning to enhance efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG), which aims to locate a specific region referred to by expressions, is a fundamental yet challenging task in the multimodal understanding fields. While recent grounding transfer works have advanced the field through one-tower architectures, they still suffer from two primary limitations: (1) over-entangled multimodal representations that exacerbate deceptive modality biases, and (2) insufficient semantic reasoning that hinders the comprehension of referential cues. In this paper, we propose BARE, a bias-aware and reasoning-enhanced framework for one-tower visual grounding. BARE introduces a mechanism that preserves modality-specific features and constructs referential semantics through three novel modules: (i) language salience modulator, (ii) visual bias correction and (iii) referential relationship enhancement, which jointly mitigate multimodal distractions and enhance referential comprehension. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that BARE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers superior computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality. DrivingGen offers a unified evaluation framework to foster reliable, controllable, and deployable driving world models, enabling scalable simulation, planning, and data-driven decision-making.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01535v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flexible image tokenizers aim to represent an image using an ordered 1D variable-length token sequence. This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence. However, this tail-truncation strategy inherently concentrates the image information in the early tokens, limiting the effectiveness of downstream AutoRegressive (AR) image generation as the token length increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \underline{Re}dundant \underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTok: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, our method achieves superior generation performance compared with both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01537v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: To enhance the generalization performance of Multi-Task Networks (MTN) in Face Attribute Recognition (FAR), it is crucial to share relevant information across multiple related prediction tasks effectively. Traditional MTN methods create shared low-level modules and distinct high-level modules, causing an exponential increase in model parameters with the addition of tasks. This approach also limits feature interaction at the high level, hindering the exploration of semantic relations among attributes, thereby affecting generalization negatively. In response, this study introduces FAR-AMTN, a novel Attention Multi-Task Network for FAR. It incorporates a Weight-Shared Group-Specific Attention (WSGSA) module with shared parameters to minimize complexity while improving group feature representation. Furthermore, a Cross-Group Feature Fusion (CGFF) module is utilized to foster interactions between attribute groups, enhancing feature learning. A Dynamic Weighting Strategy (DWS) is also introduced for synchronized task convergence. Experiments on the CelebA and LFWA datasets demonstrate that the proposed FAR-AMTN demonstrates superior accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01547v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ability to reason about spatial dynamics is a cornerstone of intelligence, yet current research overlooks the human intent behind spatial changes. To address these limitations, we introduce Teleo-Spatial Intelligence (TSI), a new paradigm that unifies two critical pillars: Physical-Dynamic Reasoning--understanding the physical principles of object interactions--and Intent-Driven Reasoning--inferring the human goals behind these actions. To catalyze research in TSI, we present EscherVerse, consisting of a large-scale, open-world benchmark (Escher-Bench), a dataset (Escher-35k), and models (Escher series). Derived from real-world videos, EscherVerse moves beyond constrained settings to explicitly evaluate an agent's ability to reason about object permanence, state transitions, and trajectory prediction in dynamic, human-centric scenarios. Crucially, it is the first benchmark to systematically assess Intent-Driven Reasoning, challenging models to connect physical events to their underlying human purposes. Our work, including a novel data curation pipeline, provides a foundational resource to advance spatial intelligence from passive scene description toward a holistic, purpose-driven understanding of the world.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01593v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Manual font design is an intricate process that transforms a stylistic visual concept into a coherent glyph set. This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, their application to FFG is constrained by conventional patch-level tokenization, which neglects global dependencies crucial for coherent font synthesis. Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation. GAR-Font introduces a global-aware tokenizer that effectively captures both local structures and global stylistic patterns, a multimodal style encoder offering flexible style control through a lightweight language-style adapter without requiring intensive multimodal pretraining, and a post-refinement pipeline that further enhances structural fidelity and style coherence. Extensive experiments show that GAR-Font outperforms existing FFG methods, excelling in maintaining global style faithfulness and achieving higher-quality results with textual stylistic guidance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01608v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models deliver high quality in image synthesis but remain expensive during training and inference. Recent works have leveraged the inherent redundancy in visual content to make training more affordable by training only on a subset of visual information. While these methods were successful in providing cheaper and more effective training, sparsely trained diffusion models struggle in inference. This is due to their lacking response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) leading to underwhelming performance during inference. To overcome this, we propose Sparse Guidance (SG). Instead of using conditional dropout as a signal to guide diffusion models, SG uses token-level sparsity. As a result, SG preserves the high-variance of the conditional prediction better, achieving good quality and high variance outputs. Leveraging token-level sparsity at inference, SG improves fidelity at lower compute, achieving 1.58 FID on the commonly used ImageNet-256 benchmark with 25% fewer FLOPs, and yields up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Sparse Guidance, we train a 2.5B text-to-image diffusion model using training time sparsity and leverage SG during inference. SG achieves improvements in composition and human preference score while increasing throughput at the same time.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01613v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prompt-based methods, which encode medical priors through descriptive text, have been only minimally explored for CT Image Quality Assessment (IQA). While such prompts can embed prior knowledge about diagnostic quality, they often introduce bias by reflecting idealized definitions that may not hold under real-world degradations such as noise, motion artifacts, or scanner variability. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Prompt-guided Image Quality Assessment (CAP-IQA) framework, which integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual, image-specific degradations. Our framework combines a CNN-based visual encoder with a domain-specific text encoder to assess diagnostic visibility, anatomical clarity, and noise perception in abdominal CT images. The model leverages radiology-style prompts and context-aware fusion to align semantic and perceptual representations. On the 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, CAP-IQA achieves an overall correlation score of 2.8590 (sum of PLCC, SROCC, and KROCC), surpassing the top-ranked leaderboard team (2.7427) by 4.24%. Moreover, our comprehensive ablation experiments confirm that prompt-guided fusion and the simplified encoder-only design jointly enhance feature alignment and interpretability. Furthermore, evaluation on an in-house dataset of 91,514 pediatric CT images demonstrates the true generalizability of CAP-IQA in assessing perceptual fidelity in a different patient population.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01639v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating human body measurements from monocular RGB imagery remains challenging due to scale ambiguity, viewpoint sensitivity, and the absence of explicit depth information. This work presents a systematic empirical study of three weakly calibrated monocular strategies: landmark-based geometry, pose-driven regression, and object-calibrated silhouettes, evaluated under semi-constrained conditions using consumer-grade cameras. Rather than pursuing state-of-the-art accuracy, the study analyzes how differing calibration assumptions influence measurement behavior, robustness, and failure modes across varied body types. The results reveal a clear trade-off between user effort during calibration and the stability of resulting circumferential quantities. This paper serves as an empirical design reference for lightweight monocular human measurement systems intended for deployment on consumer devices.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01660v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a method for consistent lighting and shadows when animated 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatars interact with 3DGS scenes or with dynamic objects inserted into otherwise static scenes. Our key contribution is Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM), a modern analogue of the classical shadow mapping algorithm tailored to the volumetric 3DGS representation. Building on the classic deep shadow mapping idea, we show that 3DGS admits closed form light accumulation along light rays, enabling volumetric shadow computation without meshing. For each estimated light, we tabulate transmittance over concentric radial shells and store them in octahedral atlases, which modern GPUs can sample in real time per query to attenuate affected scene Gaussians and thus cast and receive shadows consistently. To relight moving avatars, we approximate the local environment illumination with HDRI probes represented in a spherical harmonic (SH) basis and apply a fast per Gaussian radiance transfer, avoiding explicit BRDF estimation or offline optimization. We demonstrate environment consistent lighting for avatars from AvatarX and ActorsHQ, composited into ScanNet++, DL3DV, and SuperSplat scenes, and show interactions with inserted objects. Across single and multi avatar settings, DGSM and SH relighting operate fully in the volumetric 3DGS representation, yielding coherent shadows and relighting while avoiding meshing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01676v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting objects in 3D space from monocular input is crucial for applications ranging from robotics to scene understanding. Despite advanced performance in the indoor and autonomous driving domains, existing monocular 3D detection models struggle with in-the-wild images due to the lack of 3D in-the-wild datasets and the challenges of 3D annotation. We introduce LabelAny3D, an \emph{analysis-by-synthesis} framework that reconstructs holistic 3D scenes from 2D images to efficiently produce high-quality 3D bounding box annotations. Built on this pipeline, we present COCO3D, a new benchmark for open-vocabulary monocular 3D detection, derived from the MS-COCO dataset and covering a wide range of object categories absent from existing 3D datasets. Experiments show that annotations generated by LabelAny3D improve monocular 3D detection performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior auto-labeling approaches in quality. These results demonstrate the promise of foundation-model-driven annotation for scaling up 3D recognition in realistic, open-world settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01677v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent decades, the intensification of wildfire activity in western Canada has resulted in substantial socio-economic and environmental losses. Accurate wildfire risk prediction is hindered by the intrinsic stochasticity of ignition and spread and by nonlinear interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, climate variability, topography, and human activities, challenging the reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models. We propose a trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling, which integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation. Evaluated over western Canada during the record-breaking 2023 and 2024 fire seasons, the proposed model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and a PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty-aware analysis reveals structured spatial and seasonal patterns in predictive confidence, highlighting increased uncertainty associated with ambiguous predictions and spatiotemporal decision boundaries. SHAP-based interpretation provides mechanistic understanding of wildfire controls, showing that temperature-related drivers dominate wildfire risk in both years, while moisture-related constraints play a stronger role in shaping spatial and land-cover-specific contrasts in 2024 compared to the widespread hot and dry conditions of 2023.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01680v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face recognition for infants and toddlers presents unique challenges due to rapid facial morphology changes, high inter-class similarity, and limited dataset availability. This study evaluates the performance of four deep learning-based face recognition models FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, and CosFace on a newly developed longitudinal dataset collected over a 24 month period in seven sessions involving children aged 0 to 3 years. Our analysis examines recognition accuracy across developmental stages, showing that the True Accept Rate (TAR) is only 30.7% at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) for infants aged 0 to 6 months, due to unstable facial features. Performance improves significantly in older children, reaching 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR in the 2.5 to 3 year age group. We also evaluate verification performance over different time intervals, revealing that shorter time gaps result in higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. To mitigate this drift, we apply a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach that improves TAR by over 12%, yielding features that are more temporally stable and generalizable. These findings are critical for building biometric systems that function reliably over time in smart city applications such as public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services. The challenges observed in early age groups highlight the importance of future research on privacy preserving biometric authentication systems that can address temporal variability, particularly in secure and regulated urban environments where child verification is essential.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01687v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precise delineation of anatomical and pathological structures within 3D medical volumes is crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective surgical planning, and longitudinal disease monitoring. Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01689v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Longitudinal face recognition in children remains challenging due to rapid and nonlinear facial growth, which causes template drift and increasing verification errors over time. This work investigates whether synthetic face data can act as a longitudinal stabilizer by improving temporal robustness of child face recognition models. Using an identity disjoint protocol on the Young Face Aging (YFA) dataset, we evaluate three settings: (i) pretrained MagFace embeddings without dataset specific fine-tuning, (ii) MagFace fine-tuned using authentic training faces only, and (iii) MagFace fine-tuned using a combination of authentic and synthetically generated training faces. Synthetic data is generated using StyleGAN2 ADA and incorporated exclusively within the training identities; a post generation filtering step is applied to mitigate identity leakage and remove artifact affected samples. Experimental results across enrollment verification gaps from 6 to 36 months show that synthetic-augmented fine tuning substantially reduces error rates relative to both the pretrained baseline and real only fine tuning. These findings provide a risk aware assessment of synthetic augmentation for improving identity persistence in pediatric face recognition.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01695v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Roadside perception datasets are typically constructed via cooperative labeling between synchronized vehicle and roadside frame pairs. However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines. This confirms that learnability, not uncertainty, matters for roadside 3D perception.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01696v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-time lane detection in embedded systems encounters significant challenges due to subtle and sparse visual signals in RGB images, often constrained by limited computational resources and power consumption. Although deep learning models for lane detection categorized into segmentation-based, anchor-based, and curve-based methods there remains a scarcity of universally applicable optimization techniques tailored for low-power embedded environments. To overcome this, we propose an innovative Covariance Distribution Optimization (CDO) module specifically designed for efficient, real-time applications. The CDO module aligns lane feature distributions closely with ground-truth labels, significantly enhancing detection accuracy without increasing computational complexity. Evaluations were conducted on six diverse models across all three method categories, including two optimized for real-time applications and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, tested comprehensively on three major datasets: CULane, TuSimple, and LLAMAS. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%. The proposed CDO module is characterized by ease of integration into existing systems without structural modifications and utilizes existing model parameters to facilitate ongoing training, thus offering substantial benefits in performance, power efficiency, and operational flexibility in embedded systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01720v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: First-Frame Propagation (FFP) offers a promising paradigm for controllable video editing, but existing methods are hampered by a reliance on cumbersome run-time guidance. We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift. Comprehensive experiments on the EditVerseBench benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforming existing academic and commercial models by receiving about 0.2 PickScore and 0.3 VLM score improvement against these competitors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01746v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAE) have become a dominant paradigm in 3D representation learning, setting new performance benchmarks across various downstream tasks. Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms. For 3D object detection, Point-SRA achieves 47.3% AP@50, surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01749v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current audio-driven 3D head generation methods mainly focus on single-speaker scenarios, lacking natural, bidirectional listen-and-speak interaction. Achieving seamless conversational behavior, where speaking and listening states transition fluidly remains a key challenge. Existing 3D conversational avatar approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptional accuracy and realism in modeling two-person 3D dialogue motion, significantly advancing the fidelity and controllability of audio-driven talking heads.

In collaboration with pathologists and guided by the the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, we design a Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) that ensures comprehensive and standardized extraction of diagnostic elements from pathology reports. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on TCGA-BRCA. First, we extract pathological features from reports using CPRT. These features are then used to build CTIS-Align, a dataset of 80k slide-description pairs from 804 WSIs for vision-language alignment training, and CTIS-Bench, a rigorously curated VQA benchmark comprising 977 WSIs and 14,879 question-answer pairs. CTIS-Bench emphasizes clinically grounded, closed-ended questions (e.g., tumor grade, receptor status) that reflect real diagnostic workflows, minimize non-visual reasoning, and require genuine slide understanding. We further propose CTIS-QA, a Slide-level Question Answering model, featuring a dual-stream architecture that mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach. One stream captures global slide-level context via clustering-based feature aggregation, while the other focuses on salient local regions through attention-guided patch perception module. Extensive experiments on WSI-VQA, CTIS-Bench, and slide-level diagnostic tasks show that CTIS-QA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01781v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have become a dominant paradigm for creating general purpose models whose capabilities can be transferred to downstream supervised learning tasks. However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01784v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid evolution of AIGC technology enables misleading viewers by tampering mere small segments within a video, rendering video-level detection inaccurate and unpersuasive. Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features. Experiments on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 9\% in AP@0.95, with significant improvements in cross-domain robustness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01798v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Face verification systems have seen substantial advancements; however, they often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Vision-Language Model (VLM) for Face Verification, which not only accurately determines if two face images depict the same individual but also explicitly explains the rationale behind its decisions. Our model is uniquely trained using two complementary explanation styles: (1) concise explanations that summarize the key factors influencing its decision, and (2) comprehensive explanations detailing the specific differences observed between the images. We adapt and enhance a state-of-the-art modeling approach originally designed for audio-based differentiation to suit visual inputs effectively. This cross-modal transfer significantly improves our model's accuracy and interpretability. The proposed VLM integrates sophisticated feature extraction techniques with advanced reasoning capabilities, enabling clear articulation of its verification process. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, surpassing baseline methods and existing models. These findings highlight the immense potential of vision language models in face verification set up, contributing to more transparent, reliable, and explainable face verification systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01804v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet remain challenged by video understanding tasks that require consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence. Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a contagious viral infection that significantly deteriorates livestock health, thereby posing a serious threat to the global economy and food security. Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet. The results show that LUMPNet achieves superior performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As the demand for analyzing egocentric videos grows, egocentric visual attention prediction, anticipating where a camera wearer will attend, has garnered increasing attention. However, it remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of dynamic egocentric scenes. Motivated by evidence that scene contextual information plays a crucial role in modulating human attention, in this paper, we present a language-guided scene context-aware learning framework for robust egocentric visual attention prediction. We first design a context perceiver which is guided to summarize the egocentric video based on a language-based scene description, generating context-aware video representations. We then introduce two training objectives that: 1) encourage the framework to focus on the target point-of-interest regions and 2) suppress distractions from irrelevant regions which are less likely to attract first-person attention. Extensive experiments on Ego4D and Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness across diverse, dynamic egocentric scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01835v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning approach for Mpox diagnosis named Customized Residual SwinTransformerV2 (RSwinV2) has been proposed, trying to enhance the capability of lesion classification by employing the RSwinV2 tool-assisted vision approach. In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Most current audio-driven facial animation research primarily focuses on generating videos with neutral emotions. While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of lip movement accuracy, expression variation, and style feature expressiveness.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01856v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Feature-based anomaly detection is widely adopted in industrial inspection due to the strong representational power of large pre-trained vision encoders. While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior.   We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning.   Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01865v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the growing demand for real-time video enhancement in live applications, existing methods often struggle to balance speed and effective exposure control, particularly under uneven lighting. We introduce RRNet (Rendering Relighting Network), a lightweight and configurable framework that achieves a state-of-the-art tradeoff between visual quality and efficiency. By estimating parameters for a minimal set of virtual light sources, RRNet enables localized relighting through a depth-aware rendering module without requiring pixel-aligned training data. This object-aware formulation preserves facial identity and supports real-time, high-resolution performance using a streamlined encoder and lightweight prediction head. To facilitate training, we propose a generative AI-based dataset creation pipeline that synthesizes diverse lighting conditions at low cost. With its interpretable lighting control and efficient architecture, RRNet is well suited for practical applications such as video conferencing, AR-based portrait enhancement, and mobile photography. Experiments show that RRNet consistently outperforms prior methods in low-light enhancement, localized illumination adjustment, and glare removal.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01870v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing text-driven infrared and visible image fusion approaches often rely on textual information at the sentence level, which can lead to semantic noise from redundant text and fail to fully exploit the deeper semantic value of textual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion approach named Entity-Guided Multi-Task learning for infrared and visible image fusion (EGMT). Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels. To promote the wide application of the entity-guided image fusion framework, we release the entity-annotated version of four public datasets (i.e., TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, and MSRS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGMT achieves superior performance in preserving salient targets, texture details, and semantic consistency, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/wyshao-01/EGMT.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\Rightarrow$internalization$\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01891v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The paradigm of Earth Observation analysis is shifting from static deep learning models to autonomous agentic AI. Although recent vision foundation models and multimodal large language models advance representation learning, they often lack the sequential planning and active tool orchestration required for complex geospatial workflows. This survey presents the first comprehensive review of agentic AI in remote sensing. We introduce a unified taxonomy distinguishing between single-agent copilots and multi-agent systems while analyzing architectural foundations such as planning mechanisms, retrieval-augmented generation, and memory structures. Furthermore, we review emerging benchmarks that move the evaluation from pixel-level accuracy to trajectory-aware reasoning correctness. By critically examining limitations in grounding, safety, and orchestration, this work outlines a strategic roadmap for the development of robust, autonomous geospatial intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Custom Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer impressive capabilities for personalization in generative modeling, yet they remain vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts sequentially. Existing approaches primarily focus on minimizing interference between concepts, often neglecting the potential for positive inter-concept interactions. In this work, we present Forget Less by Learning from Parents (FLLP), a novel framework that introduces a parent-child inter-concept learning mechanism in hyperbolic space to mitigate forgetting. By embedding concept representations within a Lorentzian manifold, naturally suited to modeling tree-like hierarchies, we define parent-child relationships in which previously learned concepts serve as guidance for adapting to new ones. Our method not only preserves prior knowledge but also supports continual integration of new concepts. We validate FLLP on three public datasets and one synthetic benchmark, showing consistent improvements in both robustness and generalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01908v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and its incidence is rising globally. While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01914v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal action segmentation is a critical task in video understanding, where the goal is to assign action labels to each frame in a video. While recent advances leverage iterative refinement-based strategies, they fail to explicitly utilize the hierarchical nature of human actions. In this work, we propose HybridTAS - a novel framework that incorporates a hybrid of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries into the denoising process of diffusion models to exploit the hierarchical structure of actions. Hyperbolic geometry naturally provides tree-like relationships between embeddings, enabling us to guide the action label denoising process in a coarse-to-fine manner: higher diffusion timesteps are influenced by abstract, high-level action categories (root nodes), while lower timesteps are refined using fine-grained action classes (leaf nodes). Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic-guided denoising for the temporal action segmentation task.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Thanks to the powerful language comprehension capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing instruction-based image editing methods have introduced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to promote information exchange between instructions and images, ensuring the controllability and flexibility of image editing. However, these frameworks often build a multi-instruction dataset to train the model to handle multiple editing tasks, which is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also fails to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, we present TalkPhoto, a versatile training-free image editing framework that facilitates precise image manipulation through conversational interaction. We instruct the open-source LLM with a specially designed prompt template to analyze user needs after receiving instructions and hierarchically invoke existing advanced editing methods, all without additional training. Moreover, we implement a plug-and-play and efficient invocation of image editing methods, allowing complex and unseen editing tasks to be integrated into the current framework, achieving stable and high-quality editing results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only provides more accurate invocation with fewer token consumption but also achieves higher editing quality across various image editing tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01925v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01926v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over multimodal information, combining visual and textual data. With the development of continual learning, significant progress has been made in retaining knowledge and adapting to new information in the VQA domain. However, current methods often struggle with balancing knowledge retention, adaptation, and robust feature representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering. MacVQA fuses visual and question information while filtering noise to ensure robust representations, and employs prototype-based memory allocation to optimize feature quality and memory usage. These designs enable MacVQA to balance knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning. Experiments on ten continual VQA tasks show that MacVQA outperforms existing baselines, achieving 43.38% average accuracy and 2.32% average forgetting on standard tasks, and 42.53% average accuracy and 3.60% average forgetting on novel composition tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Although recent approaches to face normal estimation have achieved promising results, their effectiveness heavily depends on large-scale paired data for training. This paper concentrates on relieving this requirement via developing a coarse-to-fine normal estimator. Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals. Such a logical function split can significantly cut the requirement of massive paired data and computational resource. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our design and reveal its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both training expense as well as estimation quality. Our code and models are open-sourced at: https://github.com/AutoHDR/FNR2R.git.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01955v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-video models, particularly those built on the diffusion transformer architecture, have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality and temporally coherent videos. However, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging. In this work, we present MotionAdapter, a content-aware motion transfer framework that enables robust and semantically aligned motion transfer within DiT-based T2V models. Our key insight is that effective motion transfer requires \romannumeral1) explicit disentanglement of motion from appearance and \romannumeral 2) adaptive customization of motion to target content. MotionAdapter first isolates motion by analyzing cross-frame attention within 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields. To bridge the semantic gap between reference and target videos, we further introduce a DINO-guided motion customization module that rearranges and refines motion fields based on content correspondences. The customized motion field is then used to guide the DiT denoising process, ensuring that the synthesized video inherits the reference motion while preserving target appearance and semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionAdapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, MotionAdapter naturally supports complex motion transfer and motion editing tasks such as zooming.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01957v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in cross-modal tasks. However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark. Our code and data will be released for reproducibility.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01963v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Custom Diffusion Models (CDMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable ability to personalize generative processes. However, existing CDMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when continuously learning new concepts. Most prior works attempt to mitigate this issue under the sequential learning setting with a fixed order of concept inflow and neglect inter-concept interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework - Forget Less by Learning Together (FL2T) - that enables concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while addressing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce a set-invariant inter-concept learning module where proxies guide feature selection across concepts, facilitating improved knowledge retention and transfer. By leveraging inter-concept guidance, our approach preserves old concepts while efficiently incorporating new ones. Extensive experiments, across three datasets, demonstrates that our method significantly improves concept retention and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the effectiveness of inter-concept catalytic behavior in incremental concept learning of ten tasks with at least 2% gain on average CLIP Image Alignment scores.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01984v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Spatial reasoning -- the ability to perceive and reason about relationships in space -- advances vision-language models (VLMs) from visual perception toward spatial semantic understanding. Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01992v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Real-world image dehazing is a fundamental yet challenging task in low-level vision. Existing learning-based methods often suffer from significant performance degradation when applied to complex real-world hazy scenes, primarily due to limited training data and the intrinsic complexity of haze density distributions.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Adaptive Patch Importance-aware (API) framework for generalizable real-world image dehazing. Specifically, our framework consists of an Automatic Haze Generation (AHG) module and a Density-aware Haze Removal (DHR) module. AHG provides a hybrid data augmentation strategy by generating realistic and diverse hazy images as additional high-quality training data. DHR considers hazy regions with varying haze density distributions for generalizable real-world image dehazing in an adaptive patch importance-aware manner. To alleviate the ambiguity of the dehazed image details, we further introduce a new Multi-Negative Contrastive Dehazing (MNCD) loss, which fully utilizes information from multiple negative samples across both spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world benchmarks, delivering strong results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality, and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse haze distributions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01998v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Enhancing the visibility of nighttime hazy images is challenging due to the complex degradation distributions. Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively. A frequency-aware router is further introduced to adaptively guide the contribution of each expert, ensuring robust image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model on nighttime dehazing benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, we showcase the generalizability of our model in daytime dehazing and low-light enhancement tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02018v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAMs), known for their exceptional zero-shot segmentation performance, have garnered significant attention in the research community. Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM++ also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02020v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Robust depth estimation under dynamic and adverse lighting conditions is essential for robotic systems. Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

The proposed approach projects 3D point clouds onto 2D images using virtual cameras and performs semantic segmentation via a foundation 2D model guided by natural language prompts. 3D segmentation is achieved by aggregating predictions from multiple viewpoints through weighted voting. Our method outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves segmentation accuracy comparable to supervised methods. Moreover, it supports open-vocabulary recognition, enabling users to detect objects using arbitrary text queries, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional supervised approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02038v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF) is a challenging multimodal image generation task that aims to synthesize high-fidelity flat-lay garments under complex geometric deformation and rich high-frequency textures. Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02046v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models such as SDXL and FLUX have achieved impressive photorealism, yet small-scale distortions remain pervasive in limbs, face, text and so on. Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Orthognathic surgery repositions jaw bones to restore occlusion and enhance facial aesthetics. Accurate simulation of postoperative facial morphology is essential for preoperative planning. However, traditional biomechanical models are computationally expensive, while geometric deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. In this study, we develop and validate a physics-informed geometric deep learning framework named PhysSFI-Net for precise prediction of soft tissue deformation following orthognathic surgery. PhysSFI-Net consists of three components: a hierarchical graph module with craniofacial and surgical plan encoders combined with attention mechanisms to extract skeletal-facial interaction features; a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequential predictor for incremental soft tissue deformation; and a biomechanics-inspired module for high-resolution facial surface reconstruction. Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PhysSFI-Net achieved a point cloud shape error of 1.070 +/- 0.088 mm, a surface deviation error of 1.296 +/- 0.349 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.445 +/- 1.326 mm. Comparative experiments indicated that PhysSFI-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method ACMT-Net in prediction accuracy. In conclusion, PhysSFI-Net enables interpretable, high-resolution prediction of postoperative facial morphology with superior accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical application in orthognathic surgical planning and simulation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02091v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Glacial segmentation is essential for reconstructing past glacier dynamics and evaluating climate-driven landscape change. However, weak optical contrast and the limited availability of high-resolution DEMs hinder automated mapping. This study introduces the first large-scale optical-only moraine segmentation dataset, comprising 3,340 manually annotated high-resolution images from Google Earth covering glaciated regions of Sichuan and Yunnan, China. We develop MCD-Net, a lightweight baseline that integrates a MobileNetV2 encoder, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and a DeepLabV3+ decoder. Benchmarking against deeper backbones (ResNet152, Xception) shows that MCD-Net achieves 62.3\% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 72.8\% Dice coefficient while reducing computational cost by more than 60\%. Although ridge delineation remains constrained by sub-pixel width and spectral ambiguity, the results demonstrate that optical imagery alone can provide reliable moraine-body segmentation. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Lyra-alpha/MCD-Net, establishing a reproducible benchmark for moraine-specific segmentation and offering a deployable baseline for high-altitude glacial monitoring.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02098v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reconstructing complete and animatable 3D human avatars from monocular videos remains challenging, particularly under severe occlusions. While 3D Gaussian Splatting has enabled photorealistic human rendering, existing methods struggle with incomplete observations, often producing corrupted geometry and temporal inconsistencies. We present InpaintHuman, a novel method for generating high-fidelity, complete, and animatable avatars from occluded monocular videos. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) a multi-scale UV-parameterized representation with hierarchical coarse-to-fine feature interpolation, enabling robust reconstruction of occluded regions while preserving geometric details; and (ii) an identity-preserving diffusion inpainting module that integrates textual inversion with semantic-conditioned guidance for subject-specific, temporally coherent completion. Unlike SDS-based methods, our approach employs direct pixel-level supervision to ensure identity fidelity. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks (PeopleSnapshot, ZJU-MoCap) and real-world scenarios (OcMotion) demonstrate competitive performance with consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across diverse poses and viewpoints.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02102v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction is fundamental for spatial intelligence applications such as AR, robotics, and digital twins. Traditional multi-view stereo struggles with sparse viewpoints or low-texture regions, while neural rendering approaches, though capable of producing high-quality results, require per-scene optimization and lack real-time efficiency. Explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient rendering, but most feed-forward variants focus on visual quality rather than geometric consistency, limiting accurate surface reconstruction and overall reliability in spatial perception tasks. This paper presents a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images, capable of generating geometrically consistent Gaussian primitives while maintaining high rendering quality. A Depth-Normal geometric regularization is introduced to couple rendered depth gradients with normal information, supervising Gaussian rotation, scale, and position to improve point cloud and surface accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high rendering quality while significantly improving geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for 3D reconstruction in spatial perception tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02103v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent 3D-aware head generative models based on 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve real-time, photorealistic and view-consistent head synthesis. However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup. We further introduce a distillation strategy to generate high-quality normals for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering, while simultaneously supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing. We will publicly release our code and dataset.

However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02112v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02126v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semantic change detection in remote sensing aims to identify land cover changes between bi-temporal image pairs. Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks. Lastly, we showcase results over large areas in France, highlighting the scalability potential of our method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Marine oil spills are urgent environmental hazards that demand rapid and reliable detection to minimise ecological and economic damage. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show that OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation, demonstrating the value of temporally-aware methods for reliable, scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02141v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have revolutionized the field of imaging inverse problems, yielding state-of-the-art performance across various imaging domains. The best performing networks incorporate the imaging operator within the network architecture, typically in the form of deep unrolling. However, in large-scale problems, such as 3D imaging, most existing methods fail to incorporate the operator in the architecture due to the prohibitive amount of memory required by global forward operators, which hinder typical patching strategies. In this work, we present a domain partitioning strategy and normal operator approximations that enable the training of end-to-end reconstruction models incorporating forward operators of arbitrarily large problems into their architecture. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D X-ray cone-beam tomography and 3D multi-coil accelerated MRI, while requiring only a single GPU for both training and inference.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02147v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision language foundation models such as CLIP exhibit impressive zero-shot generalization yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations across visual and textual modalities. Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02177v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has shown promise for single-person gait identification, with numerous studies reporting high accuracy. However, multi-person identification remains largely unexplored, with the limited existing work relying on complex, expensive setups requiring modified firmware. A critical question remains unanswered: is poor multi-person performance an algorithmic limitation or a fundamental hardware constraint? We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\%, $\sigma$=3.74\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals high intra-subject variability, low inter-subject distinguishability, and severe performance degradation as person count increases, indicating that commodity ESP32 sensors cannot provide sufficient signal quality for reliable multi-person separation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02189v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying deep learning models for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge. While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02198v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In histopathology, pathologists examine both tissue architecture at low magnification and fine-grained morphology at high magnification. Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models. Our work paves the way towards future pathology foundation models that perform reliably across magnifications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Device-free crowd-counting using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) is a key enabling technology for a new generation of privacy-preserving Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail. To formally quantify robustness, we introduce the Generalisation Index (GI), on which our model scores near-perfectly, confirming its ability to generalise. Furthermore, our framework sets a new state-of-the-art public WiAR benchmark with 98.8\% accuracy. Our ablation studies reveal the core strength of our design: adapter-based fine-tuning achieves performance within 1\% of a full fine-tune (98.84\% vs. 99.67\%) while training 97.2\% fewer parameters. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for developing robust sensing systems ready for real-world IoT deployments.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02204v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present NextFlow, a unified decoder-only autoregressive transformer trained on 6 trillion interleaved text-image discrete tokens. By leveraging a unified vision representation within a unified autoregressive architecture, NextFlow natively activates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, unlocking abilities of image editing, interleaved content and video generation. Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that NextFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses low-light video super-resolution (LVSR), aiming to restore high-resolution videos from low-light, low-resolution (LR) inputs. Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/RetinexEVSR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02211v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent breakthroughs of transformer-based diffusion models, particularly with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) driven models like FLUX and Qwen Image, have facilitated thrilling experiences in text-to-image generation and editing. To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality. These results advance understanding of MMDiT models and provide valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02212v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate detection of ultrasound nodules is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid and breast cancers. However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02228v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Video recognition models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while existing diffusion-based purification methods suffer from inefficient sampling and curved trajectories. Directly regressing clean videos from adversarial inputs often fails to recover faithful content due to the subtle nature of perturbations; this necessitates physically shattering the adversarial structure. Therefore, we propose Flow Matching for Adversarial Video Purification FMVP. FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via a masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with an inpainting objective. To further decouple semantic content from adversarial noise, we design a Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) that explicitly suppresses high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity. We design Attack-Aware and Generalist training paradigms to handle known and unknown threats, respectively. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 demonstrate that FMVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods (DiffPure, Defense Patterns (DP), Temporal Shuffling (TS) and FlowPure), achieving robust accuracy exceeding 87% against PGD and 89% against CW attacks. Furthermore, FMVP demonstrates superior robustness against adaptive attacks (DiffHammer) and functions as a zero-shot adversarial detector, attaining detection accuracies of 98% for PGD and 79% for highly imperceptible CW attacks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02242v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Instruction-based image editing is among the fastest developing areas in generative AI. Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02246v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a standard approach for visual recognition due to their capacity to learn hierarchical representations from raw pixels. In practice, practitioners often choose among (i) training a compact custom CNN from scratch, (ii) using a large pre-trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor, and (iii) performing transfer learning via partial or full fine-tuning of a pre-trained backbone. This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts. The results show that transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance, while the custom CNN provides an attractive efficiency--accuracy trade-off, especially when compute and memory budgets are constrained.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal object detection leveraging RGB and Infrared (IR) images is pivotal for robust perception in all-weather scenarios. While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This confirms SLGNet as a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual generation is dominated by three paradigms: AutoRegressive (AR), diffusion, and Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) models. Unlike AR and diffusion, VARs operate on heterogeneous input structures across their generation steps, which creates severe asynchronous policy conflicts. This issue becomes particularly acute in reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, leading to unstable training and suboptimal alignment. To resolve this, we propose a novel framework to enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by explicitly managing these conflicts. Our method integrates three synergistic components: 1) a stabilizing intermediate reward to guide early-stage generation; 2) a dynamic time-step reweighting scheme for precise credit assignment; and 3) a novel mask propagation algorithm, derived from principles of Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL), designed to isolate optimization effects both spatially and temporally. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in sample quality and objective alignment over the vanilla GRPO baseline, enabling robust and effective optimization for VAR models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02267v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human mesh recovery from multi-view images faces a fundamental challenge: real-world datasets contain imperfect ground-truth annotations that bias the models' training, while synthetic data with precise supervision suffers from domain gap. In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02273v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Foundation segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization through large-scale pretraining, but adapting them to domain-specific semantic segmentation remains challenging, particularly for thin structures (e.g., retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (e.g., SAR imagery). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02281v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The grand vision of enabling persistent, large-scale 3D visual geometry understanding is shackled by the irreconcilable demands of scalability and long-term stability. While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding. Code is available at: https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/InfiniteVGGT

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02289v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a powerful paradigm for learning from large, unlabeled datasets, particularly in computer vision (CV). However, applying SSL to multispectral remote sensing (RS) images presents unique challenges and opportunities due to the geographical and temporal variability of the data. In this paper, we introduce GeoRank, a novel regularization method for contrastive SSL that improves upon prior techniques by directly optimizing spherical distances to embed geographical relationships into the learned feature space. GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms (e.g., BYOL, DINO). Beyond this, we present a systematic investigation of key adaptations of contrastive SSL for multispectral RS images, including the effectiveness of data augmentations, the impact of dataset cardinality and image size on performance, and the task dependency of temporal views.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02299v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing production of waste, driven by population growth, has created challenges in managing and recycling materials effectively. Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. This highlights the need for novel and more challenging datasets on the topic.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02309v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Monocular omnidirectional visual odometry (OVO) systems leverage 360-degree cameras to overcome field-of-view limitations of perspective VO systems. However, existing methods, reliant on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, often lack robustness in challenging scenarios, such as aggressive motion and varying illumination. To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images. These sparse feature patches are then used to establish constraints for effective pose estimation within a novel omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module. To facilitate evaluation in realistic settings, we also contribute a new real-world OVO benchmark. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO) demonstrate that 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geo-Foundation Models (GFMs), have proven effective in diverse downstream applications, including semantic segmentation, classification, and regression tasks. However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02318v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a hygienic and convenient alternative to contact-based systems, enabling rapid acquisition without latent prints, pressure artifacts, or hygiene risks. However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. A lightweight attention-based fusion network also integrates both modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, and then a U-Net enhancement module produces an optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally, a deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility, generates discriminative and robust representations in a unified embedding space compatible with both contactless and contact-based fingerprints for verification. F2P enhances ridge clarity and achieves superior recognition performance (AUC=0.999, EER=1.12%) over single-capture baselines (Verifinger, DeepPrint).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02329v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures), a theoretical framework that unifies concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, information geometry, and machine learning. The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence.   We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, {\pi}, {\phi}) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking G\"odel's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems.   As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning. This work bridges fundamental physics, mathematical logic, and practical system design, offering both theoretical insights into the nature of learning and computation, and a concrete pathway toward sustainable artificial intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02339v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent works propose extending 3DGS with semantic feature vectors for simultaneous semantic segmentation and image rendering. However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate improvements in segmentation accuracy and rendering quality while maintaining high rendering frame rates.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02353v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Farmers in remote areas need quick and reliable methods for identifying plant diseases, yet they often lack access to laboratories or high-performance computing resources. Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\% while maintaining 92.3\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02356v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Talk2Move, a reinforcement learning (RL) based diffusion framework for text-instructed spatial transformation of objects within scenes. Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02358v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02359v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00831v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Horizon reduction is a common design strategy in offline reinforcement learning (RL), used to mitigate long-horizon credit assignment, improve stability, and enable scalable learning through truncated rollouts, windowed training, or hierarchical decomposition (Levine et al., 2020; Prudencio et al., 2023; Park et al., 2025). Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00832v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shrimp is one of the most widely consumed aquatic species globally, valued for both its nutritional content and economic importance. Shrimp farming represents a significant source of income in many regions; however, like other forms of aquaculture, it is severely impacted by disease outbreaks. These diseases pose a major challenge to sustainable shrimp production. To address this issue, automated disease classification methods can offer timely and accurate detection. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach for the automated classification of shrimp diseases. A dataset comprising 1,149 images across four disease classes was utilized. Six pretrained deep learning models, ResNet50, EfficientNet, DenseNet201, MobileNet, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Xception were deployed and evaluated for performance. The images background was removed, followed by standardized preprocessing through the Keras image pipeline. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) was used for enhancing the model robustness through adversarial training. While advanced augmentation strategies, including CutMix and MixUp, were implemented to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. To support interpretability, and to visualize regions of model attention, post-hoc explanation methods such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and XGrad-CAM were applied. Exploratory results demonstrated that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest performance, attaining a 96.88% accuracy on the test dataset. After 1000 iterations, the 99% confidence interval for the model is [0.953,0.971].

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00834v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulating nonlinear reaction-diffusion dynamics on complex, non-Euclidean manifolds remains a fundamental challenge in computational morphogenesis, constrained by high-fidelity mesh generation costs and symplectic drift in discrete time-stepping schemes. This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a "Stochastic Cloth" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the "splitting spot" and "labyrinthine" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\mathcal{E}_{mass} \approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration. The framework offers a memory-efficient, resolution-independent paradigm for simulating biological pattern formation on evolving surfaces, bridging differential geometry and physics-informed machine learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00841v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces a practical control problem: retrieval depth and generation behavior must be chosen per query to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs) such as cost, refusal rate, and hallucination risk. This work models per-query control as a small discrete action: choose a retrieval depth and a generation mode (guarded vs. auto), or refuse. An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT). Across the evaluated settings, a strong fixed baseline (low k, guarded prompting) performs competitively; learned policies mainly provide additional cost savings under a quality-focused SLO and can exhibit refusal collapse under a cheap SLO when refusal is heavily rewarded. The contribution is a reproducible case study of SLO-aware control for RAG pipelines, emphasizing failure modes and reporting conventions rather than proposing a new retriever or language model.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Building deep learning models that can reason about their environment requires capturing its underlying dynamics. Joint-Embedded Predictive Architectures (JEPA) provide a promising framework to model such dynamics by learning representations and predictors through a self-supervised prediction objective. However, their ability to support effective action planning remains limited. We propose an approach to enhance planning with JEPA world models by shaping their representation space so that the negative goal-conditioned value function for a reaching cost in a given environment is approximated by a distance (or quasi-distance) between state embeddings. We introduce a practical method to enforce this constraint during training and show that it leads to significantly improved planning performance compared to standard JEPA models on simple control tasks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern AI inference systems treat transformer execution as mandatory, conflating model capability with execution necessity. We reframe inference as a control-plane decision problem: determining when execution is necessary versus when correctness can be preserved through alternative pathways. We introduce Meaning-First Execution (MFEE), a control-plane architecture implementing this framework, selectively invoking transformer inference only when required. MFEE operates as a gating layer above existing stacks without modifying models, weights, or parameters. Across 1,000 diverse prompts under deterministic decoding, MFEE achieves 78.1% execution reduction while maintaining 100% exact-match equivalence for invoked executions. Comparative evaluation reveals pattern-based routers achieve at most 53.3% avoidance with correctness failures, while MFEE reaches 100% avoidance with zero failures through semantic analysis. We prove this limitation via Theorem 1: any router operating solely on finite feature maps cannot simultaneously guarantee zero false skips and positive avoidance on feature-collision pairs. These results establish execution governance as a foundational layer in ML systems infrastructure, orthogonal to model-level optimization techniques.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00850v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hallucinations hinder reliable question answering, especially in resource-constrained deployments where frontier-scale models or retrieval pipelines may be impractical. We present EdgeJury, a lightweight ensemble framework that improves truthfulness and robustness using only small instruction-tuned language models (3B-8B) suitable for serverless edge inference. EdgeJury orchestrates four stages: (1) parallel role-specialized generation, (2) anonymized cross-review with structured critiques and rankings, (3) chairman synthesis that integrates the strongest content while addressing flagged issues, and (4) claim-level consistency labeling based on inter-model agreement. On TruthfulQA (MC1), EdgeJury achieves 76.2% accuracy (95% CI: 72.8-79.6%), a +21.4% relative improvement over a single 8B baseline (62.8%), and outperforms standard baselines including self-consistency and majority voting under transparent compute accounting (total tokens and platform cost reported). On a 200-question adversarial EdgeCases set, EdgeJury yields +48.2% relative gains (95% CI: 44.0-52.4%). Manual analysis on 100 incorrect answers shows an approximately 55% reduction in factual hallucination errors versus the single-model baseline. Deployed on Cloudflare Workers AI, EdgeJury achieves 8.4 s median end-to-end latency, demonstrating that coordinated small-model ensembles can improve truthfulness on misconception-heavy QA benchmarks without external retrieval or proprietary large-model APIs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00853v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, statistical heterogeneity among clients, often manifested as non-IID label distributions, poses significant challenges to convergence and generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been introduced to FL to seek flatter, more robust minima, existing approaches typically apply a uniform perturbation radius across all clients, ignoring client-specific heterogeneity. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedSCAM} (Federated Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Clustered Aggregation and Modulation), a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the SAM perturbation radius and aggregation weights based on client-specific heterogeneity scores. By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST under various degrees of Dirichlet-based label skew demonstrate that FedSCAM achieves competitive performance among state-of-the-art baselines, including FedSAM, FedLESAM, etc. in terms of convergence speed and final test accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations in existing featurization methods. More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00860v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate forecasting of battery capacity fade is essential for the safety, reliability, and long-term efficiency of energy storage systems. However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $45\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00863v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00864v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphs are commonly used in machine learning to model relationships between instances. Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed. In this work, we extend the idea of structural importance sampling to the state-of-the-art KDEy quantification approach. We show that our proposed method adapts to structural shifts and outperforms standard quantification approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants have garnered substantial focus from researchers due to their effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems governed by differential equations. In this research, a modified Auxiliary physics-informed neural network (A-PINN) framework with balanced adaptive optimizers is proposed for the analysis of structural vibration problems. In order to accurately represent structural systems, it is critical for capturing vibration phenomena and ensuring reliable predictive analysis. So, our investigations are crucial for gaining deeper insight into the robustness of scientific machine learning models for solving vibration problems. Further, to rigorously evaluate the performance of A-PINN, we conducted different numerical simulations to approximate the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations under the various scenarios. The numerical results substantiate the enhanced performance of our model in terms of both numerical stability and predictive accuracy. Our model shows improvement of at least 40% over the baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00868v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: SmartFlow is a multi-layered framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI to address the dynamic rebalancing problem in urban bike-sharing services. Its architecture separates strategic, tactical, and communication functions for clarity and scalability. At the strategic level, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent, trained in a high-fidelity simulation of New Yorks Citi Bike network, learns robust rebalancing policies by modelling the challenge as a Markov Decision Process. These high-level strategies feed into a deterministic tactical module that optimises multi-leg journeys and schedules just-in-time dispatches to minimise fleet travel. Evaluation across multiple seeded runs demonstrates SmartFlows high efficacy, reducing network imbalance by over 95% while requiring minimal travel distance and achieving strong truck utilisation. A communication layer, powered by a grounded Agentic AI with a Large Language Model (LLM), translates logistical plans into clear, actionable instructions for operational staff, ensuring interpretability and execution readiness. This integration bridges machine intelligence with human operations, offering a scalable solution that reduces idle time, improves bike availability, and lowers operational costs. SmartFlow provides a blueprint for interpretable, AI-driven logistics in complex urban mobility networks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00873v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Coordinated stealth attacks are a serious cybersecurity threat to distributed generation systems because they modify control and measurement signals while remaining close to normal behavior, making them difficult to detect using standard intrusion detection methods. This study investigates quantum machine learning approaches for detecting coordinated stealth attacks on a distributed generation unit in a microgrid. High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classification dataset using three features: reactive power at DG1, frequency deviation relative to the nominal value, and terminal voltage magnitude. Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline. Fully quantum models perform worse due to training instability and limitations of current NISQ hardware. In contrast, hybrid models train more reliably and demonstrate that quantum feature mapping can enhance intrusion detection even when fully quantum learning is not yet practical.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00874v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning capabilities beyond traditional language tasks, motivating their use for numerical optimization. This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00877v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce LearnAD, a neuro-symbolic method for predicting Alzheimer's disease from brain magnetic resonance imaging data, learning fully interpretable rules. LearnAD applies statistical models, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or GNNs to identify relevant brain connections, and then employs FastLAS to learn global rules. Our best instance outperforms Decision Trees, matches Support Vector Machine accuracy, and performs only slightly below Random Forests and GNNs trained on all features, all while remaining fully interpretable. Ablation studies show that our neuro-symbolic approach improves interpretability with comparable performance to pure statistical models. LearnAD demonstrates how symbolic learning can deepen our understanding of GNN behaviour in clinical neuroscience.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00883v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a new outlier detection method for multi-dimensional data. The method detects outliers based on vector cosine similarity, using a new dataset constructed by adding a dimension with zero values to the original data. When a point in the new dataset is selected as the measured point, an observation point is created as the origin, differing only in the new dimension by having a non-zero value compared to the measured point. Vectors are then formed from the observation point to the measured point and to other points in the dataset. By comparing the cosine similarities of these vectors, abnormal data can be identified. An optimized implementation (MDOD) is available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/mdod/.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00889v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study a physics-inspired optimizer, \emph{FANoS} (Friction-Adaptive Nos\'e--Hoover Symplectic momentum), which combines (i) a momentum update written as a discretized second-order dynamical system, (ii) a Nos\'e--Hoover-like thermostat variable that adapts a scalar friction coefficient using kinetic-energy feedback, and (iii) a semi-implicit (symplectic-Euler) integrator, optionally with a diagonal RMS preconditioner. The method is motivated by structure-preserving integration and thermostat ideas from molecular dynamics, but is used here purely as an optimization heuristic.   We provide the algorithm and limited theoretical observations in idealized settings. On the deterministic Rosenbrock-100D benchmark with 3000 gradient evaluations, FANoS-RMS attains a mean final objective value of $1.74\times 10^{-2}$, improving substantially over unclipped AdamW ($48.50$) and SGD+momentum ($90.76$) in this protocol. However, AdamW with gradient clipping is stronger, reaching $1.87\times 10^{-3}$, and L-BFGS reaches $\approx 4.4\times 10^{-10}$. On ill-conditioned convex quadratics and in a small PINN warm-start suite (Burgers and Allen--Cahn), the default FANoS configuration underperforms AdamW and can be unstable or high-variance.   Overall, the evidence supports a conservative conclusion: FANoS is an interpretable synthesis of existing ideas that can help on some stiff nonconvex valleys, but it is not a generally superior replacement for modern baselines, and its behavior is sensitive to temperature-schedule and hyperparameter choices.

Here we propose a hierarchical topological clustering algorithm that can be implemented with any distance choice. The persistence of outliers and clusters of arbitrary shape is inferred from the resulting hierarchy. We demonstrate the potential of the algorithm on selected datasets in which outliers play relevant roles, consisting of images, medical and economic data. These methods can provide meaningful clusters in situations in which other techniques fail to do so.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00894v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models apply uniform computation to all inputs, regardless of difficulty. We propose PonderTTT, a gating strategy using the TTT layer's self-supervised reconstruction loss to selectively trigger Test-Time Training (TTT) updates. The gating decision itself is training-free--requiring no learned classifier or auxiliary networks; only a single scalar threshold is initially calibrated on unlabeled data and continuously adapted via EMA to maintain target update rates. Our experiments with GPT-2 models (124M to 1.5B) on code language modeling (The Stack v2, teacher-forced perplexity) demonstrate that this signal is inference-compatible, requiring no ground-truth labels. Our Reconstruction Gating achieves 82-89% Oracle Recovery while being fully training-free, significantly outperforming Random Skip baselines (up to 16% lower loss on OOD languages).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00898v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have gained growing popularity in solving a wide range of decision-making tasks due to their superior expressiveness and controllable generation during inference. However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00908v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conformal prediction guarantees degrade under distribution shift. We study this using COVID-19 as a natural experiment across 8 supply chain tasks. Despite identical severe feature turnover (Jaccard approximately 0), coverage drops vary from 0% to 86.7%, spanning two orders of magnitude. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find catastrophic failures correlate with single-feature dependence (rho = 0.714, p = 0.047). Catastrophic tasks concentrate importance in one feature (4.5x increase), while robust tasks redistribute across many (10-20x). Quarterly retraining restores catastrophic task coverage from 22% to 41% (+19 pp, p = 0.04), but provides no benefit for robust tasks (99.8% coverage). Exploratory analysis of 4 additional tasks with moderate feature stability (Jaccard 0.13-0.86) reveals feature stability, not concentration, determines robustness, suggesting concentration effects apply specifically to severe shifts. We provide a decision framework: monitor SHAP concentration before deployment; retrain quarterly if vulnerable (>40% concentration); skip retraining if robust.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00915v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large climate-model ensembles are computationally expensive; yet many downstream analyses would benefit from additional, statistically consistent realizations of spatiotemporal climate variables. We study a generative modeling approach for producing new realizations from a limited set of available runs by transferring structure learned across an ensemble. Using monthly near-surface temperature time series from ten independent reanalysis realizations (ERA5), we find that a vanilla conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained jointly across realizations yields a fragmented latent space that fails to generalize to unseen ensemble members. To address this, we introduce a latent-constrained CVAE (LC-CVAE) that enforces cross-realization homogeneity of latent embeddings at a small set of shared geographic 'anchor' locations. We then use multi-output Gaussian process regression in the latent space to predict latent coordinates at unsampled locations in a new realization, followed by decoding to generate full time series fields. Experiments and ablations demonstrate (i) instability when training on a single realization, (ii) diminishing returns after incorporating roughly five realizations, and (iii) a trade-off between spatial coverage and reconstruction quality that is closely linked to the average neighbor distance in latent space.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00919v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Transformer architecture, a cornerstone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved extraordinary success in sequence modeling, primarily due to its attention mechanism. However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00920v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series prediction plays a pivotal role across diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, energy systems, and environmental modeling. However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00921v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a clinically relevant extra-pulmonary manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is closely linked to systemic and airway inflammation. This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight. These results indicate that geometric and quantum kernel lifts can provide measurable benefits in low-data, low-feature biomedical prediction problems, while preserving interpretability and transparent model selection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00932v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-Driven Product Development (DDPD) leverages data to learn the relationship between product design specifications and resulting properties. To discover improved designs, we train a neural network on past experiments and apply Projected Gradient Descent to identify optimal input features that maximize performance. Since many products require simultaneous optimization of multiple correlated properties, our framework employs joint neural networks to capture interdependencies among targets. Furthermore, we integrate uncertainty estimation via \emph{Conformalised Monte Carlo Dropout} (ConfMC), a novel method combining Nested Conformal Prediction with Monte Carlo dropout to provide model-agnostic, finite-sample coverage guarantees under data exchangeability. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that our method matches state-of-the-art performance while offering adaptive, non-uniform prediction intervals and eliminating the need for retraining when adjusting coverage levels.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00933v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the problem of influence maximization (IM) in an online setting, where the goal is to select a subset of nodes$\unicode{x2014}$called the seed set$\unicode{x2014}$at each time step over a fixed time horizon, subject to a cardinality budget constraint, to maximize the expected cumulative influence. We operate under a full-bandit feedback model, where only the influence of the chosen seed set at each time step is observed, with no additional structural information about the network or diffusion process. It is well-established that the influence function is submodular, and existing algorithms exploit this property to achieve low regret. In this work, we leverage this property further and propose the Lazy Online Forward Algorithm (LOFA), which achieves a lower empirical regret. We conduct experiments on a real-world social network to demonstrate that LOFA achieves superior performance compared to existing bandit algorithms in terms of cumulative regret and instantaneous reward.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00942v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The increasing prevalence of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models raises important questions regarding their reliability under stochastic decoding. While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00965v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformer classifiers such as BERT deliver impressive closed-set accuracy, yet they remain brittle when confronted with inputs from unseen categories--a common scenario for deployed NLP systems. We investigate Open-Set Recognition (OSR) for text by porting the feature attenuation hypothesis from computer vision to transformers and by benchmarking it against state-of-the-art baselines. Concretely, we adapt the COSTARR framework--originally designed for classification in computer vision--to two modest language models (BERT (base) and GPT-2) trained to label 176 arXiv subject areas. Alongside COSTARR, we evaluate Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), MaxLogit, and the temperature-scaled free-energy score under the OOSA and AUOSCR metrics. Our results show (i) COSTARR extends to NLP without retraining but yields no statistically significant gain over MaxLogit or MSP, and (ii) free-energy lags behind all other scores in this high-class-count setting. The study highlights both the promise and the current limitations of transplanting vision-centric OSR ideas to language models, and points toward the need for larger backbones and task-tailored attenuation strategies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00968v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The growing reliance on deep learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous navigation underscores the need for defenses that are both robust to adversarial perturbations and transparent in their decision-making. In this paper, we identify a connection between interpretability and robustness that can be directly leveraged during training. Specifically, we observe that spurious, unstable, or semantically irrelevant features identified through Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) contribute disproportionately to adversarial vulnerability. Building on this insight, we introduce an attribution-guided refinement framework that transforms LIME from a passive diagnostic into an active training signal. Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline. This approach does not require additional datasets or model architectures and integrates seamlessly into standard adversarial training. Theoretically, we derive an attribution-aware lower bound on adversarial distortion that formalizes the link between explanation alignment and robustness. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate substantial improvements in adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution generalization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00970v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Zero-shot time-series forecasting holds great promise, but is still in its infancy, hindered by limited and biased data corpora, leakage-prone evaluation, and privacy and licensing constraints. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the first practical univariate time series simulation pipeline which is simultaneously fast enough for on-the-fly data generation and enables notable zero-shot forecasting performance on M-Series and GiftEval benchmarks that capture trend/seasonality/intermittency patterns, typical of industrial forecasting applications across a variety of domains. Our simulator, which we call SarSim0 (SARIMA Simulator for Zero-Shot Forecasting), is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA simulation often leads to unusable paths. Instead, we follow a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from its characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside seasonalities and trends. SarSim0 is orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, and it enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series, generated on the fly; after which well-established neural network backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol. Notably, on GiftEval we observe a "student-beats-teacher" effect: models trained on our simulations exceed the forecasting accuracy of the AutoARIMA generating processes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01003v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as powerful generative models for offline policy learning, whose sampling process can be rigorously characterized by a score function guiding a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings. Across benchmarks, CDPs often outperform baseline policies, with pronounced benefits under data scarcity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper employs a data-driven approach to determine the impact of concrete mixture compositions on the temporal evolution of chloride in concrete structures. This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01014v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite their empirical success, pushing Transformer architectures to extreme depth often leads to a paradoxical failure: representations become increasingly redundant, lose rank, and ultimately collapse. Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01016v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01021v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are fundamental tools for modeling stochastic dynamics across the natural sciences and modern machine learning. Developing deep learning models for approximating their solution operators promises not only fast, practical solvers, but may also inspire models that resolve classical learning tasks from a new perspective. In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs. On the empirical side, we validate our models on a diverse suite of problems: classical SPDE benchmarks, diffusion one-step sampling on images, topological interpolation on graphs, financial extrapolation, parameter estimation, and manifold SDEs for flood prediction, demonstrating competitive accuracy and broad applicability. Overall, our results indicate that WCE-based neural operators provide a practical and scalable way to learn SDE/SPDE solution operators across diverse domains.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01023v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a task- and model-aware framework for measuring similarity between wireless datasets, enabling applications such as dataset selection/augmentation, simulation-to-real (sim2real) comparison, task-specific synthetic data generation, and informing decisions on model training/adaptation to new deployments. We evaluate candidate dataset distance metrics by how well they predict cross-dataset transferability: if two datasets have a small distance, a model trained on one should perform well on the other. We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks. For this task, we derive a label-aware distance by integrating supervised UMAP and penalties for dataset imbalance. Across both tasks, the resulting distances outperform traditional baselines and consistently exhibit stronger correlations with model transferability, supporting task-relevant comparisons between wireless datasets.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01045v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion models and score-based generative models provide a powerful framework for synthesizing high-quality images from noise. However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.   In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present ML-UCB, a generalized upper confidence bound algorithm that integrates arbitrary machine learning models into multi-armed bandit frameworks. A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01062v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in descriptive tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). However, their ability to generate engaging, long-form narratives -- specifically multi-speaker podcast dialogues -- remains under-explored and difficult to evaluate. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the nuances of conversational naturalness, personality, and narrative flow, often rewarding safe, repetitive outputs over engaging storytelling. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for end-to-end visual podcast generation, and fine-tune a Qwen3-VL-32B model on a curated dataset of 4,000 image-dialogue pairs. Crucially, we use a synthetic-to-real training strategy: we train on high-quality podcast dialogues from the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) paired with synthetically generated imagery, and evaluate on real-world photo sequences from the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned 32B model significantly outperforms a 235B base model in conversational naturalness ($>$80\% win rate) and narrative depth (+50\% turn length), while maintaining identical visual grounding capabilities (CLIPScore: 20.39).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01065v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms, is a rapidly growing industry facing challenges such as water quality fluctuations, disease outbreaks, and inefficient feed management. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual labor and are time consuming, leading to potential delays in addressing issues. This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations. By demonstrating the potential benefits of TinyML in aquaculture, our aim is to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient farming practices.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01069v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Non-stationary parametric bandits have attracted much attention recently. There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(k_\mu^{5/4} c_\mu^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\tilde{O}(k_\mu^{2} c_\mu^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_\mu$ and $c_\mu$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP. For both classes, we propose algorithms based on the weighted strategy and establish dynamic regret guarantees using our analysis framework.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01075v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Embodied systems experience the world as 'a symphony of flows': a combination of many continuous streams of sensory input coupled to self-motion, interwoven with the dynamics of external objects. These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01089v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding cellular mechanisms requires integrating information across DNA, RNA, and protein - the three molecular systems linked by the Central Dogma of molecular biology. While domain-specific foundation models have achieved success for each modality individually, they remain isolated, limiting our ability to model integrated cellular processes. Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene. These results suggest that AI architectures aligned with biological information flow can achieve both predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early detection of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is essential for preventing progression to end-stage renal disease. However, existing screening tools - primarily developed using populations from high-income countries - often underperform in Bangladesh and South Asia, where risk profiles differ. Most of these tools rely on simple additive scoring functions and are based on data from patients with advanced-stage CKD. Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets. Compared with existing screening tools, the proposed models achieved substantially higher accuracy and sensitivity while requiring fewer and more accessible inputs. External validation confirmed strong generalizability with 78% to 98% sensitivity. SHAP interpretation identified clinically meaningful predictors consistent with established CKD risk factors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01123v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and more. A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01127v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper, introducing a novel method in philomatics, draws on Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance from analytic philosophy to develop a clustering algorithm for machine learning. According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01146v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In numerous practical applications, acquiring substantial quantities of labelled data is challenging and expensive, but unlabelled data is readily accessible. Conventional supervised learning methods frequently underperform in scenarios characterised by little labelled data or imbalanced datasets. This study introduces a hybrid semi-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that integrates Neurochaos Learning (NL) with a threshold-based Self-Training (ST) method to overcome this constraint. The NL architecture converts input characteristics into chaos-based ring-rate representations that encapsulate nonlinear relationships within the data, whereas ST progressively enlarges the labelled set utilising high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The model's performance is assessed using ten benchmark datasets and five machine learning classifiers, with 85% of the training data considered unlabelled and just 15% utilised as labelled data. The proposed Self-Training Neurochaos Learning (NL+ST) architecture consistently attains superior performance gain relative to standalone ST models, especially on limited, nonlinear and imbalanced datasets like Iris (188.66%), Wine (158.58%) and Glass Identification (110.48%). The results indicate that using chaos-based feature extraction with SSL improves generalisation, resilience, and classification accuracy in low-data contexts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01150v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental machine learning task with broad real-world applications. Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01162v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Categorical data are prevalent in domains such as healthcare, marketing, and bioinformatics, where clustering serves as a fundamental tool for pattern discovery. A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance. Without appropriate similarity measures, values are often treated as equidistant, creating a semantic gap that obscures latent structures and degrades clustering quality. Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over seven representative counterparts, with gains of 19-27%. Code is available at https://github.com/develop-yang/ARISE

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Personality assessment in career guidance and personnel selection traditionally relies on self-report questionnaires, which are susceptible to response bias, fatigue, and intentional distortion. Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions. These findings demonstrate that implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay is promising in predicting software-development suitability without explicit personality testing, supporting serious games as a scalable, engaging, and less biased alternative for career assessment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01207v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Semi-supervised learning on real-world graphs is frequently challenged by heterophily, where the observed graph is unreliable or label-disassortative. Many existing graph neural networks either rely on a fixed adjacency structure or attempt to handle structural noise through regularization. In this work, we explicitly capture structural uncertainty by modeling a posterior distribution over signed adjacency matrices, allowing each edge to be positive, negative, or absent. We propose a sparse signed message passing network that is naturally robust to edge noise and heterophily, which can be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective. By combining (i) posterior marginalization over signed graph structures with (ii) sparse signed message aggregation, our approach offers a principled way to handle both edge noise and heterophily. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baseline models on heterophilic benchmarks under both synthetic and real-world structural noise.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01223v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical decision-making demands uncertainty quantification that provides both distribution-free coverage guarantees and risk-adaptive precision, requirements that existing methods fail to jointly satisfy. We present a hybrid Bayesian-conformal framework that addresses this fundamental limitation in healthcare predictions. Our approach integrates Bayesian hierarchical random forests with group-aware conformal calibration, using posterior uncertainties to weight conformity scores while maintaining rigorous coverage validity. Evaluated on 61,538 admissions across 3,793 U.S. hospitals and 4 regions, our method achieves target coverage (94.3% vs 95% target) with adaptive precision: 21% narrower intervals for low-uncertainty cases while appropriately widening for high-risk predictions. Critically, we demonstrate that well-calibrated Bayesian uncertainties alone severely under-cover (14.1%), highlighting the necessity of our hybrid approach. This framework enables risk-stratified clinical protocols, efficient resource planning for high-confidence predictions, and conservative allocation with enhanced oversight for uncertain cases, providing uncertainty-aware decision support across diverse healthcare settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01231v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Background: While digital access has expanded rapidly in resource-constrained contexts, satisfaction with digital learning platforms varies significantly among students with seemingly equal connectivity. Traditional digital divide frameworks fail to explain these variations.   Purpose: This study introduces the "Dependency Divide", a novel framework proposing that highly engaged students become conditionally vulnerable to infrastructure failures, challenging assumptions that engagement uniformly benefits learners in post-access environments.   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 396 university students in Bangladesh using a three-stage analytical approach: (1) stability-validated K-prototypes clustering to identify student profiles, (2) profile-specific Random Forest models with SHAP and ALE analysis to determine satisfaction drivers, and (3) formal interaction analysis with propensity score matching to test the Dependency Divide hypothesis.   Results: Three distinct profiles emerged: Casually Engaged (58%), Efficient Learners (35%), and Hyper-Engaged (7%). A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows. Policy simulations demonstrated that targeted reliability improvements for high-dependency users yielded 2.06 times greater returns than uniform interventions.   Conclusions: In fragile infrastructure contexts, capability can become liability. Digital transformation policies must prioritize reliability for dependency-prone users, establish contingency systems, and educate students about dependency risks rather than uniformly promoting engagement.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01237v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers for long-context sequence modeling, offering linear $O(N)$ computational complexity compared to the Transformer's quadratic $O(N^2)$ scaling. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study comparing the Mamba SSM against the LLaMA Transformer on long-context sequences, using dyadic therapy sessions as a representative test case. We evaluate both architectures across two dimensions: (1) computational efficiency, where we measure memory usage and inference speed from 512 to 8,192 tokens, and (2) representational efficiency, where we analyze hidden state dynamics and attention patterns. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners working with long-context applications, establishing precise conditions under which SSMs offer advantages over Transformers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01268v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose and test a method to reduce the dimensionality of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) inputs as computational cost mitigation approach. Given modern seismic acquisition systems, the data (as input for FWI) required for an industrial-strength case is in the teraflop level of storage, therefore solving complex subsurface cases or exploring multiple scenarios with FWI become prohibitive. The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01290v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a prominent paradigm to rapidly customize LLMs to new tasks without fine-tuning. However, despite the empirical evidence of its usefulness, we still do not truly understand how ICL works. In this paper, we compare the behavior of in-context learning with supervised classifiers trained on ICL demonstrations to investigate three research questions: (1) Do LLMs with ICL behave similarly to classifiers trained on the same examples? (2) If so, which classifiers are closer, those based on gradient descent (GD) or those based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN)? (3) When they do not behave similarly, what conditions are associated with differences in behavior? Using text classification as a use case, with six datasets and three LLMs, we observe that LLMs behave similarly to these classifiers when the relevance of demonstrations is high. On average, ICL is closer to kNN than logistic regression, giving empirical evidence that the attention mechanism behaves more similarly to kNN than GD. However, when demonstration relevance is low, LLMs perform better than these classifiers, likely because LLMs can back off to their parametric memory, a luxury these classifiers do not have.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Universal approximation theorems show that neural networks can approximate any continuous function; however, the number of parameters may grow exponentially with the ambient dimension, so these results do not fully explain the practical success of deep models on high-dimensional data. Barron space theory addresses this: if a target function belongs to a Barron space, a two-layer network with $n$ parameters achieves an $O(n^{-1/2})$ approximation error in $L^2$. Yet classical Barron spaces $\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\mathscr{B}^{\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s>0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity. Then we prove that functions in $\mathscr{B}^{\log}$ can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with explicit depth dependence. We then define a family $\mathscr{B}^{s,\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved. Our results clarify how depth reduces regularity requirements for efficient representation, offering a more precise explanation for the performance of deep architectures beyond the classical Barron setting, and for their stable use in high-dimensional problems used today.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01297v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting distributional drift in high-dimensional data streams presents fundamental challenges: global comparison methods scale poorly, projection-based approaches lose geometric structure, and re-clustering methods suffer from identity instability. This paper introduces Argus, A framework that reconceptualizes drift detection as tracking local statistics over a fixed spatial partition of the data manifold.   The key contributions are fourfold. First, it is proved that Voronoi tessellations over canonical orthonormal frames yield drift metrics that are invariant to orthogonal transformations. The rotations and reflections that preserve Euclidean geometry. Second, it is established that this framework achieves O(N) complexity per snapshot while providing cell-level spatial localization of distributional change. Third, a graph-theoretic characterization of drift propagation is developed that distinguishes coherent distributional shifts from isolated perturbations. Fourth, product quantization tessellation is introduced for scaling to very high dimensions (d>500) by decomposing the space into independent subspaces and aggregating drift signals across subspaces.   This paper formalizes the theoretical foundations, proves invariance properties, and presents experimental validation demonstrating that the framework correctly identifies drift under coordinate rotation while existing methods produce false positives. The tessellated approach offers a principled geometric foundation for distribution monitoring that preserves high-dimensional structure without the computational burden of pairwise comparisons.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks suffer from linear memory scaling, rendering "System 2" parallel reasoning impractical on consumer hardware. We present Warp Cortex, an asynchronous architecture that theoretically enables million-agent cognitive scaling by decoupling agent logic from physical memory. Through Singleton Weight Sharing and a novel Topological Synapse--inspired by hybrid landmarking techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA)--we reduce memory complexity from O(N * L) to O(1) for weights and O(N * k) for context, where k << L. By treating the KV-cache as a point cloud in latent space, we apply witness-complex-inspired sparsification to preserve persistent homological features of the context manifold. On a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, we empirically demonstrate 100 concurrent agents at 2.2 GB total VRAM, with theoretical capacity exceeding 1,000 agents before compute latency becomes the bottleneck. We further introduce Referential Injection, a non-intrusive KV-cache update mechanism that allows asynchronous sub-agents to influence primary generation without stream disruption.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The $\mu$-parameterization ($\mu$P) provides a principled foundation for large language model (LLM) training by prescribing width-independent learning dynamics, which in turn enables predictable scaling behavior and robust hyperparameter transfer across model sizes. A central requirement of $\mu$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $\mu$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $\mu$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $\mu$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $\mu$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training. We also take the first step towards an adaptive spectral condition by incorporating data-dependent effects, making it better suited for long-horizon LLM training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scaling sequence modeling to extreme contexts requires balancing computational efficiency with representational expressivity. While Transformers provide precise retrieval via the attention mechanism, their quadratic $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ complexity limits their application to long-horizon tasks. In this work, we propose the \textbf{Spectral-Window Hybrid (SWH)}, an architecture that decouples sequence modeling into two \textit{parallel} streams: a global branch utilizing the Convolution Theorem to model long-range decay dynamics in $\mathcal{O}(T \log T)$ time, and a local branch employing sliding-window attention for token interactions within a bounded context. By aggregating these representations, SWH avoids the computational bottleneck of global attention while retaining local precision. We demonstrate that SWH matches the perplexity of standard Transformers on short contexts while enabling efficient linear scaling to extended sequences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01347v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Computational biology offers immense potential for reducing the high costs and protracted cycles of new drug development through adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction. However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01357v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) is transforming artificial intelligence into autonomous research partners, yet a critical gap persists in complex scientific domains such as combustion modeling. Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis.

This paper proposes an approach based on the f-GAN framework, learning the binary causal structure independent of specific weight values. We reformulate the structure learning problem as minimizing Bayesian free energy and prove that this problem is equivalent to minimizing the f-divergence between the true data distribution and the model-generated distribution. Using the f-GAN framework, we transform this objective into a min-max adversarial optimization problem. We implement the gradient search in the discrete graph space using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01383v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used across computer vision and other domains. When working on the model induction, selecting the right architecture for a given dataset often relies on repetitive trial-and-error procedures. This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01387v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing deep learning models with strong adaptability to topological variations is of great practical significance for power flow analysis. To enhance model performance under variable system scales and improve robustness in branch power prediction, this paper proposes a Scale-adaptive Multi-task Power Flow Analysis (SaMPFA) framework. SaMPFA introduces a Local Topology Slicing (LTS) sampling technique that extracts subgraphs of different scales from the complete power network to strengthen the model's cross-scale learning capability. Furthermore, a Reference-free Multi-task Graph Learning (RMGL) model is designed for robust power flow prediction. Unlike existing approaches, RMGL predicts bus voltages and branch powers instead of phase angles. This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws. Simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real provincial grid in China demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior adaptability and generalization under variable system scales, with accuracy improvements of 4.47% and 36.82%, respectively.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01403v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the increasing volume of streaming data in industrial systems, online anomaly detection has become a critical task. The diverse and rapidly evolving data patterns pose significant challenges for online anomaly detection. Many existing anomaly detection methods are designed for offline settings or have difficulty in handling heterogeneous streaming data effectively. This paper proposes GDME, an unsupervised graph-based framework for online time series anomaly detection using model ensemble. GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%. In addition, its ensemble strategy provides superior detection performance compared with both individual models and average ensembles, with competitive computational efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01417v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider the problem of exact computation of the maximum function over $d$ real inputs using ReLU neural networks. We prove a depth hierarchy, wherein width $\Omega\big(d^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k-2}-1}}\big)$ is necessary to represent the maximum for any depth $3\le k\le \log_2(\log_2(d))$. This is the first unconditional super-linear lower bound for this fundamental operator at depths $k\ge3$, and it holds even if the depth scales with $d$. Our proof technique is based on a combinatorial argument and associates the non-differentiable ridges of the maximum with cliques in a graph induced by the first hidden layer of the computing network, utilizing Tur\'an's theorem from extremal graph theory to show that a sufficiently narrow network cannot capture the non-linearities of the maximum. This suggests that despite its simple nature, the maximum function possesses an inherent complexity that stems from the geometric structure of its non-differentiable hyperplanes, and provides a novel approach for proving lower bounds for deep neural networks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01424v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding the interaction of neural and cardiac systems during cognitive activity is critical to advancing physiological computing. Although EEG has been the gold standard for assessing mental workload, its limited portability restricts its real-world use. Widely available ECG through wearable devices proposes a pragmatic alternative. This research investigates whether ECG signals can reliably reflect cognitive load and serve as proxies for EEG-based indicators. In this work, we present multimodal data acquired from two different paradigms involving working-memory and passive-listening tasks. For each modality, we extracted ECG time-domain HRV metrics and Catch22 descriptors against EEG spectral and Catch22 features, respectively. We propose a cross-modal XGBoost framework to project the ECG features onto EEG-representative cognitive spaces, thereby allowing workload inferences using only ECG. Our results show that ECG-derived projections expressively capture variation in cognitive states and provide good support for accurate classification. Our findings underpin ECG as an interpretable, real-time, wearable solution for everyday cognitive monitoring.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01452v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with zeroth-order (ZO) optimization reduces memory by approximating gradients through function evaluations, but existing methods rely on one-step gradient estimates from random perturbations. We introduce Bayesian Subspace Zeroth-Order optimization (BSZO), a ZO optimizer that applies Kalman filtering to combine finite-difference information across multiple perturbation directions. By treating each finite-difference measurement as a noisy observation, BSZO builds a posterior distribution over the projected gradient and updates it through Bayesian inference, with a residual-based adaptive mechanism to adjust perturbation scales. Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/\gamma$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms MeZO, MeZO-Adam, and HiZOO across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\times$--1.08$\times$ of MeZO).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01465v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Information-theoretic (IT) generalization bounds have been used to study the generalization of learning algorithms. These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called "omniscient trajectory". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $\Omega(1)$ rates to $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. It also implies a by-pass of memorization-generalization trade-offs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, \textit{a storage-based approach to GNN training} has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: \textit{how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os}. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named \textsf{AGNES}, that employs a method of \textit{block-wise storage I/O processing} to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, \textsf{AGNES} employs a simple yet effective strategy, \textit{hyperbatch-based processing} based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that \textsf{AGNES} consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1$\times$ faster than the best competitor.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have achieved a great performance with a small dataset of size $n$ and a fast optimization process. However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data. After that, based on such MoE-latent MoG score, we provide a $R^4\sqrt{\Sigma_{k=1}^Kn_k}\sqrt{\Sigma_{k=1}^Kn_kd_k}/\sqrt{n}$ estimation error, which escapes the curse of dimensionality by using data structure. Finally, we study the optimization process and prove the convergence guarantee under the MoLR-MoG modeling. Combined with these results, under a setting close to real-world data, this work explains why diffusion models only require a small training sample and enjoy a fast optimization process to achieve a great performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01484v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a central paradigm for transferring knowledge from a large teacher network to a typically smaller student model, often by leveraging soft probabilistic outputs. While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Decentralized optimization has emerged as a critical paradigm for distributed learning, enabling scalable training while preserving data privacy through peer-to-peer collaboration. However, existing methods often suffer from communication bottlenecks due to frequent synchronization between nodes. We present Overlapping Local Decentralized SGD (OLDSGD), a novel approach to accelerate decentralized training by computation-communication overlapping, significantly reducing network idle time. With a deliberately designed update, OLDSGD preserves the same average update as Local SGD while avoiding communication-induced stalls. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for smooth non-convex objectives, showing that OLDSGD retains the same iteration complexity as standard Local Decentralized SGD while improving per-iteration runtime. Empirical results demonstrate OLDSGD's consistent improvements in wall-clock time convergence under different levels of communication delays. With minimal modifications to existing frameworks, OLDSGD offers a practical solution for faster decentralized learning without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01501v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Wildfires, as an integral component of the Earth system, are governed by a complex interplay of atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes spanning a vast range of spatiotemporal scales. Modeling their global activity on large timescales is therefore a critical yet challenging task. While deep learning has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in global weather forecasting, its potential for global wildfire behavior prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we represent the Earth system as a multi-level graph hierarchy and propose an adaptive filtering message passing mechanism for both intra- and inter-level information flow, enabling more effective feature extraction and fusion. Furthermore, we incorporate GNN-parameterized Neural ODE modules at multiple levels to explicitly learn the continuous dynamics inherent to each scale. Through extensive experiments on the SeasFire Cube dataset, we demonstrate that HiGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-range wildfire forecasting. Moreover, its continuous-time predictions exhibit strong observational consistency, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01558v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting river flow in places without streamflow records is challenging because basins respond differently to climate, terrain, vegetation, and soils. Traditional basin attributes describe some of these differences, but they cannot fully represent the complexity of natural environments. This study examines whether AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, which are learned from large collections of satellite images rather than designed by experts, offer a more informative way to describe basin characteristics. These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy. The results show that satellite-informed environmental representations can strengthen hydrological forecasting and support the development of models that adapt more easily to different landscapes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01580v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Self-reflection capabilities emerge in Large Language Models after RL post-training, with multi-turn RL achieving substantial gains over SFT counterparts. Yet the mechanism of how a unified optimization objective gives rise to functionally distinct capabilities of generating solutions and evaluating when to revise them remains opaque. To address this question, we introduce the Gradient Attribution Property to characterize how reward gradients distribute across policy components, formalized through the Two-Stage Decision-Sampling (DS) Hypothesis, which decomposes the policy into sampling ($\pi_{sample}$) for generation and decision ($\pi_{d}$) for verification. We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $\pi_{sample}$ while leaving $\pi_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails. We also empirically validate our theoretical predictions on arithmetic reasoning demonstrates that RL's superior generalization stems primarily from improved decision-making ($\pi_{d}$) rather than sampling capabilities, providing a first-principles mechanistic explanation for self-correction in thinking models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01605v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is critically important for meteorological forecasting. Deep learning-based Radar Echo Extrapolation (REE) has become a predominant nowcasting approach, yet it suffers from poor generalization due to its reliance on high-quality local training data and static model parameters, limiting its applicability across diverse regions and extreme events. To overcome this, we propose REE-TTT, a novel model that incorporates an adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanism. The core of our model lies in the newly designed Spatio-temporal Test-Time Training (ST-TTT) block, which replaces the standard linear projections in TTT layers with task-specific attention mechanisms, enabling robust adaptation to non-stationary meteorological distributions and thereby significantly enhancing the feature representation of precipitation. Experiments under cross-regional extreme precipitation scenarios demonstrate that REE-TTT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy and generalization, exhibiting remarkable adaptability to data distribution shifts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01616v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The textile industry in Bangladesh is one of the most energy-intensive sectors, yet its monitoring practices remain largely outdated, resulting in inefficient power usage and high operational costs. To address this, we propose a real-time Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)-based framework tailored for industrial applications, with a focus on identical motor-driven loads representing textile cutting machines. A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms. A new dataset was created from three identical induction motors and auxiliary loads, totaling over 180,000 samples, to evaluate the state-of-the-art MATNILM model under challenging industrial conditions. Results indicate that while aggregate energy estimation was reasonably accurate, per-appliance disaggregation faced difficulties, particularly when multiple identical machines operated simultaneously. Despite these challenges, the integrated system demonstrated practical real-time monitoring with remote accessibility through the Blynk application. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of NILM in industrial contexts, offering insights into future improvements such as higher-frequency data collection, larger-scale datasets and advanced deep learning approaches for handling identical loads.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01649v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated AUC maximization is a powerful approach for learning from imbalanced data in federated learning (FL). However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks in image classification, medical imaging, and fraud detection demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01653v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the face of adverse motives, it is indispensable to achieve a consensus. Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01663v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study generative modeling of \emph{variable-length trajectories} -- sequences of visited locations/items with associated timestamps -- for downstream simulation and counterfactual analysis. A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01664v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Consider a collection of m competing machine learning algorithms. Given their performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to ``win'' (rank highest) on a future, unseen dataset. The standard maximum likelihood approach suggests counting the number of wins per each algorithm. In this work, we argue that there is much more information in the complete rankings. That is, the number of times that each algorithm finished second, third and so forth. Yet, it is not entirely clear how to effectively utilize this information for our purpose. In this work we introduce a novel conceptual framework for estimating the win probability for each of the m algorithms, given their complete rankings over a benchmark of datasets. Our proposed framework significantly improves upon currently known methods in synthetic and real-world examples.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01665v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great promise in addressing multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Nevertheless, the robustness of these learning-based solvers has remained insufficiently explored, especially across diverse and complex problem distributions. In this paper, we propose a unified robustness-oriented framework for preference-conditioned DRL solvers for MOCOPs. Within this framework, we develop a preference-based adversarial attack to generate hard instances that expose solver weaknesses, and quantify the attack impact by the resulting degradation on Pareto-front quality. We further introduce a defense strategy that integrates hardness-aware preference selection into adversarial training to reduce overfitting to restricted preference regions and improve out-of-distribution performance. The experimental results on multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) verify that our attack method successfully learns hard instances for different solvers. Furthermore, our defense method significantly strengthens the robustness and generalizability of neural solvers, delivering superior performance on hard or out-of-distribution instances.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01678v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-based reasoning models have enabled the development of agentic systems that act as co-scientists, assisting in multi-step scientific analysis. However, evaluating these systems is challenging, as it requires realistic, end-to-end research scenarios that integrate data analysis, interpretation, and the generation of new insights from the experimental data. To address this limitation, we introduce HeurekaBench, a framework to create benchmarks with exploratory, open-ended research questions for experimental datasets. Each such question is grounded in a scientific study and its corresponding code repository, and is created using a semi-automated pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to extract insights and generate candidate workflows, which are then verified against reported findings. We instantiate the framework in single-cell biology to obtain sc-HeurekaBench benchmark and use it to compare state-of-the-art single-cell agents. We further showcase the benefits of our benchmark for quantitatively analyzing current design choices in agentic systems. We find that the addition of a critic module can improve ill-formed responses for open-source LLM-based agents by up to 22% and close the gap with their closed-source counterparts. Overall, HeurekaBench sets a path toward rigorous, end-to-end evaluation of scientific agents, grounding benchmark construction in real scientific workflows.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01688v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Model stealing attacks pose an existential threat to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), allowing adversaries to replicate proprietary models for a fraction of their training cost. While Data-Free Model Extraction (DFME) has emerged as a stealthy vector, it remains fundamentally constrained by the "Cold Start" problem: GAN-based adversaries waste thousands of queries converging from random noise to meaningful data. We propose DiMEx, a framework that weaponizes the rich semantic priors of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models to bypass this initialization barrier entirely. By employing Random Embedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) within the generator's latent space, DiMEx synthesizes high-fidelity queries immediately, achieving 52.1 percent agreement on SVHN with just 2,000 queries - outperforming state-of-the-art GAN baselines by over 16 percent. To counter this highly semantic threat, we introduce the Hybrid Stateful Ensemble (HSE) defense, which identifies the unique "optimization trajectory" of latent-space attacks. Our results demonstrate that while DiMEx evades static distribution detectors, HSE exploits this temporal signature to suppress attack success rates to 21.6 percent with negligible latency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01692v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Conformal prediction is a framework for uncertainty quantification that constructs prediction sets for previously unseen data, guaranteeing coverage of the true label with a specified probability. However, the efficiency of these prediction sets, measured by their size, depends on the choice of the underlying learning model. Relying on a single fixed model may lead to suboptimal performance in online environments, as a single model may not consistently perform well across all time steps. To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency. At each time step, a bipartite graph is generated to identify a subset of effective models, from which a model is selected to construct the prediction set. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing multi-model conformal prediction techniques in terms of both prediction set size and computational efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01701v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Anomaly detection is increasingly becoming crucial for maintaining the safety, reliability, and efficiency of industrial systems. Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01714v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Language models (LMs) are trained on billions of tokens in an attempt to recover the true language distribution. Still, vanilla random sampling from LMs yields low quality generations. Decoding algorithms attempt to restrict the LM distribution to a set of high-probability continuations, but rely on greedy heuristics that introduce myopic distortions, yielding sentences that are homogeneous, repetitive and incoherent. In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries. We also evaluate EPIC on mathematical reasoning, where it outperforms all baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transformers excel on tasks that process well-formed inputs according to some grammar, such as natural language and code. However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ looping layers and $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01786v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ever-increasing adoption of Large Language Models in critical sectors like finance, healthcare, and government raises privacy concerns regarding the handling of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during training. In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01792v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni, the first any-to-any omnimodal model in the HyperCLOVA X family that supports text, audio, and vision as both inputs and outputs. By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01793v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning is a privacy-focused approach towards machine learning where models are trained on client devices with locally available data and aggregated at a central server. However, the dependence on a single central server is challenging in the case of a large number of clients and even poses the risk of a single point of failure. To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical claims through numerical simulations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01800v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown considerable potential in autonomous driving (AD), yet its vulnerability to perturbations remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01803v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often learn policies that achieve the same episodic return yet behave very differently, due to a combination of environmental (random transitions, initial conditions, reward noise) and algorithmic (minibatch selection, exploration noise) factors. In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(\theta)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $\theta$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(\theta)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(\theta)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(\theta)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(\theta)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01829v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Predicting the evolution of complex physical systems remains a central problem in science and engineering. Despite rapid progress in scientific Machine Learning (ML) models, a critical bottleneck is the lack of expensive real-world data, resulting in most current models being trained and validated on simulated data. Beyond limiting the development and evaluation of scientific ML, this gap also hinders research into essential tasks such as sim-to-real transfer. We introduce RealPDEBench, the first benchmark for scientific ML that integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations. RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines. We first present five real-world measured datasets with paired simulated datasets across different complex physical systems. We further define three tasks, which allow comparisons between real-world and simulated data, and facilitate the development of methods to bridge the two. Moreover, we design eight evaluation metrics, spanning data-oriented and physics-oriented metrics, and finally benchmark ten representative baselines, including state-of-the-art models, pretrained PDE foundation models, and a traditional method. Experiments reveal significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data, while showing that pretraining with simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence. In this work, we hope to provide insights from real-world data, advancing scientific ML toward bridging the sim-to-real gap and real-world deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01833v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing local data. However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01840v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Federated learning has drawn widespread interest from researchers, yet the data heterogeneity across edge clients remains a key challenge, often degrading model performance. Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01860v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Detecting high-order epistasis is a fundamental challenge in genetic association studies due to the combinatorial explosion of candidate locus combinations. Although multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a widely used method for evaluating epistasis, exhaustive MDR-based searches become computationally infeasible as the number of loci or the interaction order increases. In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective and computationally efficient for high-order epistasis detection.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01887v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost. Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation-based one-shot federated learning (OSFL) trains a model in a single communication round without sharing raw data, making OSFL attractive for privacy-sensitive medical applications. However, existing methods aggregate predictions from all clients to form a global teacher. Under non-IID data, conflicting predictions cancel out during averaging, yielding near-uniform soft labels that provide weak supervision for distillation. We propose FedBiCross, a personalized OSFL framework with three stages: (1) clustering clients by model output similarity to form coherent sub-ensembles, (2) bi-level cross-cluster optimization that learns adaptive weights to selectively leverage beneficial cross-cluster knowledge while suppressing negative transfer, and (3) personalized distillation for client-specific adaptation. Experiments on four medical image datasets demonstrate that FedBiCross consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across different non-IID degrees.

We present TT-FSI, which exploits FSI's algebraic structure via Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Our main theoretical contribution is proving that the linear operator $v \mapsto \text{FSI}(v)$ admits an MPO representation with TT-rank $O(\ell d)$, enabling an efficient sweep algorithm with $O(\ell^2 d^3 \cdot 2^d)$ time and $O(\ell d^2)$ core storage an exponential improvement over existing methods. Experiments on six datasets ($d=8$ to $d=20$) demonstrate up to 280$\times$ speedup over baseline, 85$\times$ over SHAP-IQ, and 290$\times$ memory reduction. TT-FSI scales to $d=20$ (1M coalitions) where all competing methods fail.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01904v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Learning from Preferences in Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) has gained attention recently, as it serves as a natural fit for complicated tasks where the reward function is not easily available. However, preferences often come with uncertainty and noise if they are not from perfect teachers. Much prior literature aimed to detect noise, but with limited types of noise and most being uniformly distributed with no connection to observations. In this work, we formalize the notion of targeted feature-dependent noise and propose several variants like trajectory feature noise, trajectory similarity noise, uncertainty-aware noise, and Language Model noise.   We evaluate feature-dependent noise, where noise is correlated with certain features in complex continuous control tasks from DMControl and Meta-world. Our experiments show that in some feature-dependent noise settings, the state-of-the-art noise-robust PbRL method's learning performance is significantly deteriorated, while PbRL method with no explicit denoising can surprisingly outperform noise-robust PbRL in majority settings.   We also find language model's noise exhibits similar characteristics to feature-dependent noise, thereby simulating realistic humans and call for further study in learning with feature-dependent noise robustly.

We hypothesize that a key limitation of existing offline DRL methods lies in their approach to uniformly underestimate return quantiles. This uniform pessimism can lead to overly conservative value estimates, ultimately hindering generalization and performance. To address this, we introduce a novel concept called quantile distortion, which enables non-uniform pessimism by adjusting the degree of conservatism based on the availability of supporting data. Our approach is grounded in theoretical analysis and empirically validated, demonstrating improved performance over uniform pessimism.

As SMOTE is one of the most popular approaches to addressing this issue, it is imperative to validate it not only empirically but also theoretically. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of SMOTE's convergence properties. Concretely, we prove that the synthetic random variable Z converges in probability to the underlying random variable X. We further prove a stronger convergence in mean when X is compact. Finally, we show that lower values of the nearest neighbor rank lead to faster convergence offering actionable guidance to practitioners. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments using both real-life and synthetic data. Our work provides a foundational understanding that enhances data augmentation techniques beyond imbalanced data scenarios.

However, most approaches rely on static datasets, which have been suggested to encourage memorisation and limit generalisation. We introduce D\'ej\`aQ, a framework that departs from this paradigm by jointly evolving a diverse set of synthetic mathematical problems alongside model training. This evolutionary process adapts to the model's ability throughout training, optimising problems for learnability. We propose two LLM-driven mutation strategies in which the model itself mutates the training data, either by altering contextual details or by directly modifying problem structure. We find that the model can generate novel and meaningful problems, and that these LLM-driven mutations improve RL training. We analyse key aspects of D\'ej\`aQ, including the validity of generated problems and computational overhead. Our results underscore the potential of dynamically evolving training data to enhance mathematical reasoning and indicate broader applicability, which we will support by open-sourcing our code.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present SynRXN, a unified benchmarking framework and open-data resource for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). SynRXN decomposes end-to-end synthesis planning into five task families, covering reaction rebalancing, atom-to-atom mapping, reaction classification, reaction property prediction, and synthesis route design. Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension. By removing dataset heterogeneity and packaging transparent, reusable evaluation scaffolding, SynRXN enables fair longitudinal comparison of CASP methods, supports rigorous ablations and stress tests along the full reaction-informatics pipeline, and lowers the barrier for practitioners who seek robust and comparable performance estimates for real-world synthesis planning workloads.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01966v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Instruction tuning increasingly relies on LLM-based prompt refinement, where prompts in the training corpus are selectively rewritten by an external refiner to improve clarity and instruction alignment. This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01979v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Domain alignment refers broadly to learning correspondences between data distributions from distinct domains. In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.

In contrast to existing regret bounds, this shows that to within logarithmic factors, the prior-dependent ``burn-in'' term $d r \sqrt{\mathrm{Tr}(\Sigma_0)}$ decouples additively from the minimax (long run) regret $\sigma d \sqrt{T}$. Previous regret bounds exhibit a multiplicative dependence on these terms. We establish these results via a new ``elliptical potential'' lemma, and also provide a lower bound indicating that the burn-in term is unavoidable.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02031v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pretraining of large language models is not only expensive but also prone to certain training instabilities. A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called {\mu}-centering, or a regularization method called {\mu}-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that {\mu}-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.

The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02037v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) anomaly detection is critical in domains such as service monitor, IoT, and network security. While multi-model methods based on selection or ensembling outperform single-model ones, they still face limitations: (i) selection methods rely on a single chosen model and are sensitive to the strategy; (ii) ensembling methods often combine all models or are restricted to univariate data; and (iii) most methods depend on fixed data dimensionality, limiting scalability. To address these, we propose DMPEAD, a Dynamic Model Pool and Ensembling framework for MTS Anomaly Detection. The framework first (i) constructs a diverse model pool via parameter transfer and diversity metric, then (ii) updates it with a meta-model and similarity-based strategy for adaptive pool expansion, subset selection, and pool merging, finally (iii) ensembles top-ranked models through proxy metric ranking and top-k aggregation in the selected subset, outputting the final anomaly detection result. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model outperforms all baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and scalability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02050v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The El Ni{~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts profound influence on global climate variability, yet its prediction remains a grand challenge. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved forecasting skill, but the opacity of these models hampers scientific trust and operational deployment. Here, we introduce a mathematically grounded interpretability framework based on bounded variation function. By rescuing the "dead" neurons from the saturation zone of the activation function, we enhance the model's expressive capacity. Our analysis reveals that ENSO predictability emerges dominantly from the tropical Pacific, with contributions from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, consistent with physical understanding. Controlled experiments affirm the robustness of our method and its alignment with established predictors. Notably, we probe the persistent Spring Predictability Barrier (SPB), finding that despite expanded sensitivity during spring, predictive performance declines-likely due to suboptimal variable selection. These results suggest that incorporating additional ocean-atmosphere variables may help transcend SPB limitations and advance long-range ENSO prediction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02080v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Doubly-stochastic matrices (DSM) are increasingly utilized in structure-preserving deep architectures -- such as Optimal Transport layers and Sinkhorn-based attention -- to enforce numerical stability and probabilistic interpretability. In this work, we identify a critical spectral degradation phenomenon inherent to these constraints, termed the Homogeneity Trap. We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value \sigma_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking \sigma_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse. Our findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between entropic stability and spectral expressivity in DSM-constrained networks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02081v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale datasets poses a major computational challenge to model training. The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02094v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Neural networks for time series forecasting have relied on error metrics and architecture-specific interpretability approaches for model selection that don't apply across models of different families. To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02105v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Weight initialization remains decisive for neural network optimization, yet existing methods are largely layer-agnostic. We study initialization for deeply-supervised architectures with auxiliary classifiers, where untrained auxiliary heads can destabilize early training through gradient interference.   We propose LION-DG, a layer-informed initialization that zero-initializes auxiliary classifier heads while applying standard He-initialization to the backbone. We prove that this implements Gradient Awakening: auxiliary gradients are exactly zero at initialization, then phase in naturally as weights grow -- providing an implicit warmup without hyperparameters.   Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with DenseNet-DS and ResNet-DS architectures demonstrate: (1) DenseNet-DS: +8.3% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 with comparable accuracy, (2) Hybrid approach: Combining LSUV with LION-DG achieves best accuracy (81.92% on CIFAR-10), (3) ResNet-DS: Positive speedup on CIFAR-100 (+11.3%) with side-tap auxiliary design.   We identify architecture-specific trade-offs and provide clear guidelines for practitioners. LION-DG is simple, requires zero hyperparameters, and adds no computational overhead.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02138v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate identification of protein binding sites is crucial for understanding biomolecular interaction mechanisms and for the rational design of drug targets. Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/. In summary, our approach offers a novel and efficient solution that balances prediction accuracy, generalization, and interpretability for identifying functional sites in proteins.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the standard paradigm for domain adaptation, yet it frequently incurs the cost of catastrophic forgetting. In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as "Confident Conflicts" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02193v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the extent to which standard machine learning algorithms rely on exchangeability and independence of data by introducing a monotone adversarial corruption model. In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a "clean" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional "corrupted" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees. Our results showcase how optimal learning algorithms break down in the face of seemingly helpful monotone corruptions, exposing their overreliance on exchangeability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated cyber defense (ACD) seeks to protect computer networks with minimal or no human intervention, reacting to intrusions by taking corrective actions such as isolating hosts, resetting services, deploying decoys, or updating access controls. However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02201v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The development of Multimodal Virtual Agents has made significant progress through the integration of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, mainstream training paradigms face key challenges: Behavior Cloning is simple and effective through imitation but suffers from low behavioral diversity, while Reinforcement Learning is capable of discovering novel strategies through exploration but heavily relies on manually designed reward functions. To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space. Experiments on Web and Android platforms demonstrate that CORE significantly improves both overall performance and generalization, highlighting its potential as a robust and generalizable training paradigm for building powerful virtual agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02213v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deploying 3D graph neural networks (GNNs) that are equivariant to 3D rotations (the group SO(3)) on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational cost. This paper addresses the problem by compressing and accelerating an SO(3)-equivariant GNN using low-bit quantization techniques. Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations. Experiments on the QM9 and rMD17 molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our 8-bit models achieve accuracy on energy and force predictions comparable to full-precision baselines with markedly improved efficiency. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric. The proposed techniques enable the deployment of symmetry-aware GNNs in practical chemistry applications with 2.37--2.73x faster inference and 4x smaller model size, without sacrificing accuracy or physical symmetry.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02232v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe catastrophic forgetting when adapted sequentially to new tasks in a continual learning (CL) setting. Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\%$ and a $35\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Deep Learning is increasingly constrained by its heavy reliance on high-performance hardware, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02264v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Earthquake prediction and seismic hazard assessment remain fundamental challenges in geophysics, with existing machine learning approaches often operating as black boxes that ignore established physical laws. We introduce POSEIDON (Physics-Optimized Seismic Energy Inference and Detection Operating Network), a physics-informed energy-based model for unified multi-task seismic event prediction, alongside the Poseidon dataset -- the largest open-source global earthquake catalog comprising 2.8 million events spanning 30 years. POSEIDON embeds fundamental seismological principles, including the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relationship and Omori-Utsu aftershock decay law, as learnable constraints within an energy-based modeling framework. The architecture simultaneously addresses three interconnected prediction tasks: aftershock sequence identification, tsunami generation potential, and foreshock detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POSEIDON achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, outperforming gradient boosting, random forest, and CNN baselines with the highest average F1 score among all compared methods. Crucially, the learned physics parameters converge to scientifically interpretable values -- Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 0.752 and Omori-Utsu parameters p=0.835, c=0.1948 days -- falling within established seismological ranges while enhancing rather than compromising predictive accuracy. The Poseidon dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BorisKriuk/Poseidon, providing pre-computed energy features, spatial grid indices, and standardized quality metrics to advance physics-informed seismic research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02307v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving method for sharing text data by sharing noisy versions of their transformer embeddings. It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with R\'enyi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02310v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-Frequency trading (HFT) environments are characterised by large volumes of limit order book (LOB) data, which is notoriously noisy and non-linear. Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS). The code for the experiments in this project can be found at https://github.com/AhmadMak/Temporal-Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks-T-KAN-for-High-Frequency-Limit-Order-Book-Forecasting.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02313v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Coding theory plays a crucial role in enabling reliable communication, storage, and computation. Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.   In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02316v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Empirical evaluation serves as the primary compass guiding research progress in foundation models. Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets. Our work outlines a path toward evaluation practices that are both rigorous and sustainable as VLMs continue to scale.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02360v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pre-training large language models (LLMs) increasingly requires distributed compute, yet bandwidth constraints make it difficult to scale beyond well-provisioned datacenters-especially when model parallelism forces frequent, large inter-device communications. We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-communication data parallel method based on infrequent synchronization and sparse pseudo-gradient exchange, can be combined with low-bandwidth pipeline model parallelism via activation and activation-gradient compression. We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00814v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The paper presents our work on cross-lingual ontology alignment system which uses embedding based cosine similarity matching. The ontology entities are made contextually richer by creating descriptions using novel techniques. We use a fine-tuned transformer based multilingual model for generating better embeddings. We use cosine similarity to find positive ontology entities pairs and then apply threshold filtering to retain only highly similar entities. We have evaluated our work on OAEI-2022 multifarm track. We achieve 71% F1 score (78% recall and 65% precision) on the evaluation dataset, 16% increase from best baseline score. This suggests that our proposed alignment pipeline is able to capture the subtle cross-lingual similarities.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00816v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contemporary AI systems achieve extraordinary performance yet remain opaque and non-verifiable, creating a crisis of trust for safety-critical deployment. We introduce MathLedger, a substrate for verifiable machine cognition that integrates formal verification, cryptographic attestation, and learning dynamics into a single epistemic loop. The system implements Reflexive Formal Learning (RFL), a symbolic analogue of gradient descent where updates are driven by verifier outcomes rather than statistical loss.   Phase I experiments validate the measurement and governance substrate under controlled conditions. CAL-EXP-3 validates measurement infrastructure (Delta p computation, variance tracking); separate stress tests confirm fail-closed governance triggers correctly under out-of-bounds conditions. No convergence or capability claims are made. The contribution is infrastructural: a working prototype of ledger-attested learning that enables auditability at scale.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00818v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Significant digitalization of financial services in a short period of time has led to an urgent demand to have autonomous, transparent and real-time credit risk decision making systems. The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00821v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models face a fundamental tension between context window limits and information fidelity in long conversations. Existing approaches--truncation and summarization--either discard early information or lose nuanced details. We introduce CogCanvas, a training-free framework that extracts verbatim-grounded cognitive artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) from conversation turns and organizes them into a temporal-aware graph for compression-resistant retrieval.   On the LoCoMo benchmark, CogCanvas achieves 34.7% overall accuracy, outperforming RAG (25.6%, +9.1pp) and GraphRAG (13.7%, +21.0pp). The advantage is most pronounced on temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs. 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG)--a +530% relative improvement. On multi-hop causal reasoning, CogCanvas achieves 81.0% pass rate vs. 40.0% for GraphRAG (+41.0pp). Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall (+78.5pp vs. summarization) with 93.0% exact match preservation.   While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: approximately 92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00823v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00828v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely believed to possess self-correction capabilities, yet recent studies suggest that intrinsic self-correction--where models correct their own outputs without external feedback--remains largely ineffective. In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00830v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When AI systems explain their reasoning step-by-step, practitioners often assume these explanations reveal what actually influenced the AI's answer. We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While Deep Learning has improved Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) decoding accuracy, clinical adoption is hindered by the "Black Box" nature of these algorithms, leading to user frustration and poor neuroplasticity outcomes. We propose OmniNeuro, a novel HCI framework that transforms the BCI from a silent decoder into a transparent feedback partner. OmniNeuro integrates three interpretability engines: (1) Physics (Energy), (2) Chaos (Fractal Complexity), and (3) Quantum-Inspired uncertainty modeling. These metrics drive real-time Neuro-Sonification and Generative AI Clinical Reports. Evaluated on the PhysioNet dataset ($N=109$), the system achieved a mean accuracy of 58.52%, with qualitative pilot studies ($N=3$) confirming that explainable feedback helps users regulate mental effort and reduces the "trial-and-error" phase. OmniNeuro is decoder-agnostic, acting as an essential interpretability layer for any state-of-the-art architecture.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00845v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present an openly documented methodology for fine-tuning language models to detect temporal attack patterns in multi-agent AI workflows using OpenTelemetry trace analysis. We curate a dataset of 80,851 examples from 18 public cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces. We apply iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware (NVIDIA DGX Spark) through three training iterations with strategic augmentation. Our custom benchmark accuracy improves from 42.86% to 74.29%, a statistically significant 31.4-point gain. Targeted examples addressing specific knowledge gaps outperform indiscriminate scaling. Key contributions include: (1) synthetic trace generation methodology for multi-agent coordination attacks and regulatory violations, (2) empirical evidence that training data composition fundamentally determines behavior, and (3) complete open release of datasets, training scripts, and evaluation benchmarks on HuggingFace. While practical deployment requires human oversight due to false positive rates, this work establishes the first reproducible framework enabling practitioners to build custom agentic security models adapted to their threat landscapes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00869v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate consumer information discovery,   brands face algorithmic invisibility. This study investigates Cultural Encoding in Large   Language Models (LLMs) -- systematic differences in brand recommendations arising from   training data composition. Analyzing 1,909 pure-English queries across 6 LLMs (GPT-4o,   Claude, Gemini, Qwen3, DeepSeek, Doubao) and 30 brands, we find Chinese LLMs exhibit 30.6   percentage points higher brand mention rates than International LLMs (88.9% vs. 58.3%,   p<.001). This disparity persists in identical English queries, indicating training data   geography -- not language -- drives the effect. We introduce the Existence Gap: brands   absent from LLM training corpora lack "existence" in AI responses regardless of quality.   Through a case study of Zhizibianjie (OmniEdge), a collaboration platform with 65.6%   mention rate in Chinese LLMs but 0% in International models (p<.001), we demonstrate how   Linguistic Boundary Barriers create invisible market entry obstacles. Theoretically, we   contribute the Data Moat Framework, conceptualizing AI-visible content as a VRIN strategic   resource. We operationalize Algorithmic Omnipresence -- comprehensive brand visibility   across LLM knowledge bases -- as the strategic objective for Generative Engine Optimization   (GEO). Managerially, we provide an 18-month roadmap for brands to build Data Moats   through semantic coverage, technical depth, and cultural localization. Our findings reveal   that in AI-mediated markets, the limits of a brand's "Data Boundaries" define the limits   of its "Market Frontiers."

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00880v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present Universal Conditional Logic (UCL), a mathematical framework for prompt optimization that transforms prompt engineering from heuristic practice into systematic optimization. Through systematic evaluation (N=305, 11 models, 4 iterations), we demonstrate significant token reduction (29.8%, t(10)=6.36, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.01) with corresponding cost savings. UCL's structural overhead function O_s(A) explains version-specific performance differences through the Over-Specification Paradox: beyond threshold S* = 0.509, additional specification degrades performance quadratically. Core mechanisms -- indicator functions (I_i in {0,1}), structural overhead (O_s = gamma * sum(ln C_k)), early binding -- are validated. Notably, optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture -- certain models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) require version-specific adaptations (V4.1). This work establishes UCL as a calibratable framework for efficient LLM interaction, with model-family-specific optimization as a key research direction.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00885v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work on language model self-improvement shows that models can refine their own reasoning through reflection, verification, debate, or self-generated rewards. However, most existing approaches rely on external critics, learned reward models, or ensemble sampling, which increases complexity and training instability. We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single language model generates and evaluates counterfactual critiques of its own reasoning. The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This thesis investigates two key phenomena in large language models (LLMs): in-context learning (ICL) and model collapse. We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.

By grounding our experiments in a realistic environment, we aimed to overcome the limitations of game-based simulations often used in prior research. We observed the comprehensive use of 25 specific persuasion techniques across most tested LLMs, encompassing a wider range than previously reported. The variations in technique usage and overall persuasion output between models highlight how different model architectures and training can impact the dynamics in realistic social simulations. Additionally, we observed unique phenomena such as "kernel of truth" messages and spontaneous developments with an "ink" obsession, where agents collectively demanded written proof. Our study provides a foundation for evaluating persuasive LLM agents in real-world contexts, ensuring alignment and preventing dangerous outcomes.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01195v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) involves multi-hop reasoning over temporally constrained entity relationships in the knowledge graph to answer a given question. However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01301v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a recursive AlphaZero-style Monte--Carlo tree search algorithm, "RMCTS". The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.   The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in "Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.   The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello.

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01330v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, with Gemini-3-Pro setting a new performance milestone. In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01363v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scientific discovery increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous, high-dimensional data across disciplines nowadays. While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01366v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLMs) in autonomous agents, cross-platform task execution capabilities in educational settings have garnered significant attention. However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01378v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly used for financial classification due to their fast inference and local deployability. However, compared with large language models, SLMs are more prone to factual hallucinations in reasoning and exhibit weaker classification performance. This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance. We hope this pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01511v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Estimating causal treatment effects in observational settings is frequently compromised by selection bias arising from unobserved confounders. While traditional econometric methods struggle when these confounders are orthogonal to structured covariates, high-dimensional unstructured text often contains rich proxies for these latent variables. This study proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework designed to leverage text embeddings for causal identification. Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter. These findings suggest that deep learning architectures are essential for satisfying the unconfoundedness assumption when conditioning on high-dimensional natural language data

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01522v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous decision agents in settings with asymmetric error costs: hiring (missed talent vs wasted interviews), medical triage (missed emergencies vs unnecessary escalation), and fraud detection (approved fraud vs declined legitimate payments). The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds "confidence," and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points). Ablations attribute 51 percent of savings to multi-LLM aggregation, 43 percent to sequential updating, and 20 percent to disagreement-triggered information gathering, consistent with the theoretical benefits of correct probabilistic foundations.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the progressive journey toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), current evaluation paradigms face an epistemological crisis. Static benchmarks measure knowledge breadth but fail to quantify the depth of belief. While Simhi et al. (2025) defined the CHOKE phenomenon in standard QA, we extend this framework to quantify "Cognitive Conviction" in System 2 reasoning models. We propose Project Aletheia, a cognitive physics framework that employs Tikhonov Regularization to invert the judge's confusion matrix. To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol. Our preliminary pilot study on 2025 baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggests that while reasoning models act as a "cognitive buffer," they may exhibit "Defensive OverThinking" under adversarial pressure. Furthermore, we introduce the Aligned Conviction Score (S_aligned) to verify that conviction does not compromise safety. This work serves as a blueprint for measuring AI scientific integrity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01546v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in experimental settings, but they systematically diverge from human decisions in complex decision-making environments, where participants must anticipate others' actions and form beliefs based on observed behavior. We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation. Our findings clarify when each stage is necessary and provide a systematic approach for designing and diagnosing LLM social simulations as complements to human subjects in behavioral research.

Logics-STEM targets reasoning tasks in the domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and exhibits exceptional performance on STEM-related benchmarks with an average improvement of 4.68% over the next-best model at 8B scale. We attribute the gains to our data-algorithm co-design engine, where they are jointly optimized to fit a gold-standard distribution behind reasoning. Data-wise, the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset is constructed from a meticulously designed data curation engine with 5 stages to ensure the quality, diversity, and scalability, including annotation, deduplication, decontamination, distillation, and stratified sampling. Algorithm-wise, our failure-driven post-training framework leverages targeted knowledge retrieval and data synthesis around model failure regions in the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage to effectively guide the second-stage SFT or the reinforcement learning (RL) for better fitting the target distribution. The superior empirical performance of Logics-STEM reveals the vast potential of combining large-scale open-source data with carefully designed synthetic data, underscoring the critical role of data-algorithm co-design in enhancing reasoning capabilities through post-training. We make both the Logics-STEM models (8B and 32B) and the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset (10M and downsampled 2.2M versions) publicly available to support future research in the open-source community.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01569v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly capable of complex task execution, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by text-centric paradigms. Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from "LLM-as-Text-Generator" to "LLM-as-Runtime-Operator." We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\% in multi-turn scenarios. On data-intensive tasks, direct variable storage and retrieval reduces token consumption by 59\%, allowing CaveAgent to handle large-scale data that causes context overflow failures in both JSON-based and Code-based agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01609v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rule-based reasoning over natural language input arises in domains where decisions must be auditable and justifiable: clinical protocols specify eligibility criteria in prose, evidence rules define admissibility through textual conditions, and scientific standards dictate methodological requirements. Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.

In enterprise-oriented tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), complex table understanding, and summarization, Yuan3.0 Flash consistently achieves superior performance. Moreover, it also demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities in domains such as mathematics, science, etc., attaining accuracy comparable to frontier model while requiring only approximately 1/4 to 1/2 of the average tokens.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01743v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: AI agents -- systems that combine foundation models with reasoning, planning, memory, and tool use -- are rapidly becoming a practical interface between natural-language intent and real-world computation. This survey synthesizes the emerging landscape of AI agent architectures across: (i) deliberation and reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought-style decomposition, self-reflection and verification, and constraint-aware decision making), (ii) planning and control (from reactive policies to hierarchical and multi-step planners), and (iii) tool calling and environment interaction (retrieval, code execution, APIs, and multimodal perception). We organize prior work into a unified taxonomy spanning agent components (policy/LLM core, memory, world models, planners, tool routers, and critics), orchestration patterns (single-agent vs.\ multi-agent; centralized vs.\ decentralized coordination), and deployment settings (offline analysis vs.\ online interactive assistance; safety-critical vs.\ open-ended tasks). We discuss key design trade-offs -- latency vs.\ accuracy, autonomy vs.\ controllability, and capability vs.\ reliability -- and highlight how evaluation is complicated by non-determinism, long-horizon credit assignment, tool and environment variability, and hidden costs such as retries and context growth. Finally, we summarize measurement and benchmarking practices (task suites, human preference and utility metrics, success under constraints, robustness and security) and identify open challenges including verification and guardrails for tool actions, scalable memory and context management, interpretability of agent decisions, and reproducible evaluation under realistic workloads.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01765v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The rapid progress of artificial intelligence increasingly relies on efficient integrated circuit (IC) design. Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, but existing benchmarks mainly evaluate syntactic correctness rather than optimization quality in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA). This work introduces RTL-OPT, a benchmark for assessing the capability of LLMs in RTL optimization. RTL-OPT contains 36 handcrafted digital designs that cover diverse implementation categories including combinational logic, pipelined datapaths, finite state machines, and memory interfaces. Each task provides a pair of RTL codes, a suboptimal version and a human-optimized reference that reflects industry-proven optimization patterns not captured by conventional synthesis tools. Furthermore, RTL-OPT integrates an automated evaluation framework to verify functional correctness and quantify PPA improvements, enabling standardized and meaningful assessment of generative models for hardware design optimization.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01774v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solution pervade engineering practice, from fluid mechanics friction factor calculations to orbital position determination. We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.

We propose a multi-session benchmark (spanning 6-10 sessions across three distinct stages) that demands critical capabilities such as memory continuity, adaptive reasoning, and longitudinal planning. The dataset is annotated with extensive professional skills, comprising over 677 meta-skills and 4577 atomic skills. \textbf{2) How to train a multi-therapy AI counselor?} While existing models often focus on a single therapy, complex cases frequently require flexible strategies among various therapies. We construct a diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities (Psychodynamic, Behaviorism, CBT, Humanistic Existentialist, and Postmodernist) alongside an integrative therapy with a unified three-stage clinical framework across six core psychological topics. \textbf{3) How to systematically evaluate an AI counselor?} We establish a holistic evaluation framework with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics across Client-Level and Counselor-Level dimensions. To support this, we also construct over 2,000 diverse client profiles. Extensive experimental analysis fully validates the superior quality and clinical fidelity of our dataset. Crucially, \texttt{PsychEval} transcends static benchmarking to serve as a high-fidelity reinforcement learning environment that enables the self-evolutionary training of clinically responsible and adaptive AI counselors.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01816v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.   MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.

Yet existing safety evaluations focus exclusively on universal harms. We present COMPASS (Company/Organization Policy Alignment Assessment), the first systematic framework for evaluating whether LLMs comply with organizational allowlist and denylist policies. We apply COMPASS to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries that test both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases. Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models, we uncover a fundamental asymmetry: models reliably handle legitimate requests (>95% accuracy) but catastrophically fail at enforcing prohibitions, refusing only 13-40% of adversarial denylist violations. These results demonstrate that current LLMs lack the robustness required for policy-critical deployments, establishing COMPASS as an essential evaluation framework for organizational AI safety.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01844v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured clinical narratives. However, existing approaches often rely on structured inputs and lack robust validation of factual accuracy and semantic consistency, limitations that are especially problematic in oncology. We introduce an end-to-end framework for clinical KG construction and evaluation directly from free text using multi-agent prompting and a schema-constrained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) strategy. Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations. Experimental results demonstrate consistent gains in precision, relevance, and ontology compliance over baseline methods.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01857v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving the task performance of an autonomous agent, especially in context understanding, tool usage, and response generation, has become increasingly critical. Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius (https://www.jenius.cn), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01875v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated pathology image analysis is central to clinical diagnosis, but clinicians still ask which slide features drive a model's decision and why. Vision-language models can produce natural language explanations, but these are often correlational and lack verifiable evidence. In this paper, we introduce an SQL-centered agentic framework that enables both feature measurement and reasoning to be auditable. Specifically, after extracting human-interpretable cellular features, Feature Reasoning Agents compose and execute SQL queries over feature tables to aggregate visual evidence into quantitative findings. A Knowledge Comparison Agent then evaluates these findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring how pathologists justify diagnoses from measurable observations. Extensive experiments evaluated on two pathology visual question answering datasets demonstrate our method improves interpretability and decision traceability while producing executable SQL traces that link cellular measurements to diagnostic conclusions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01878v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Socio-cognitive benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often fail to predict real-world behavior, even when models achieve high benchmark scores. Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01910v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous path planning requires a synergy between global reasoning and geometric precision, especially in complex or cluttered environments. While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.   We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01976v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) aims to exploit the vast amounts of data generated daily across various domains of computer applications. Its objective is to extract hidden and meaningful knowledge from datasets through a structured process comprising several key steps: data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and visualization. Among the core data mining techniques are classification and clustering. Classification involves predicting the class of new instances using a classifier trained on labeled data. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classifiers, Nearest Neighbor search, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The last one is recognized as an effective approach for interpretable and explainable learning. It is grounded in the mathematical structure of the concept lattice, which enables the generation of formal concepts and the discovery of hidden relationships among them. In this paper, we present a state-of-theart review of FCA-based classifiers. We explore various methods for computing closure operators from nominal data and introduce a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01982v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but remain brittle in domains requiring precise logical and symbolic reasoning. Chaotic dynamical systems provide an especially demanding test because chaos is deterministic yet often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity. We introduce ChaosBench-Logic, a benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic (FOL) ontology. Each system is annotated with truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, and 621 questions are generated across seven reasoning categories, including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues. We define metrics for logical accuracy, implication consistency, dialogue coherence, and contradiction, and we release an open-source evaluation pipeline. Initial experiments show that frontier LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the open-source LLaMA-3 70B achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy, yet still score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot). ChaosBench-Logic provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing such failures and a foundation for developing neuro-symbolic approaches that improve scientific reasoning in LLMs.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01993v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for mental health support, yet training such models is constrained by the scarcity and sensitivity of real counseling dialogues. In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning has long been understood as a pathway between stages of understanding. Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., "symbolic reasoning". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can "reason" by way of imitating the process of "thinking out loud", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the "stochastic parrot" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02061v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often exhibit erratic, high-frequency control behaviors that hinder real-world deployment due to excessive energy consumption and mechanical wear. We systematically investigate action smoothness regularization through higher-order derivative penalties, progressing from theoretical understanding in continuous control benchmarks to practical validation in building energy management. Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance. We extend these findings to HVAC control systems where smooth policies reduce equipment switching by 60%, translating to significant operational benefits. Our work establishes higher-order action regularization as an effective bridge between RL optimization and operational constraints in energy-critical applications.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02071v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Pharmaceutical three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced fabrication technology with the potential to enable truly personalised dosage forms. Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02163v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as long-term interactive agents, yet their limited context windows make it difficult to sustain coherent behavior over extended interactions. Existing memory systems often store isolated records and retrieve fragments, limiting their ability to consolidate evolving user states and resolve conflicts. We introduce EverMemOS, a self-organizing memory operating system that implements an engram-inspired lifecycle for computational memory. Episodic Trace Formation converts dialogue streams into MemCells that capture episodic traces, atomic facts, and time-bounded Foresight signals. Semantic Consolidation organizes MemCells into thematic MemScenes, distilling stable semantic structures and updating user profiles. Reconstructive Recollection performs MemScene-guided agentic retrieval to compose the necessary and sufficient context for downstream reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval show that EverMemOS achieves state-of-the-art performance on memory-augmented reasoning tasks. We further report a profile study on PersonaMem v2 and qualitative case studies illustrating chat-oriented capabilities such as user profiling and Foresight.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02170v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of large language models, yet hallucinations in such settings often emerge subtly and propagate across reasoning steps. We suggest that hallucination in long CoT reasoning is better understood as an evolving latent state rather than a one-off erroneous event. Accordingly, we treat step-level hallucination judgments as local observations and introduce a cumulative prefix-level hallucination signal that tracks the global evolution of the reasoning state over the entire trajectory. Overall, our approach enables streaming hallucination detection in long CoT reasoning, providing real-time, interpretable evidence.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02314v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decision-making, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become a critical safety concern. While \textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($\phi$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($\rho$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as "Reasoning Theater" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\times$ to $7\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic manipulation, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on behavior cloning, leading to brittleness under distribution shift. While augmenting pretrained models with test-time search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can mitigate these failures, existing formulations rely solely on the VLA prior for guidance, lacking a grounded estimate of expected future return. Consequently, when the prior is inaccurate, the planner can only correct action selection via the exploration term, which requires extensive simulation to become effective. To address this limitation, we introduce Value Vision-Language-Action Planning and Search (V-VLAPS), a framework that augments MCTS with a lightweight, learnable value function. By training a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the latent representations of a fixed VLA backbone (Octo), we provide the search with an explicit success signal that biases action selection toward high-value regions. We evaluate V-VLAPS on the LIBERO robotic manipulation suite, demonstrating that our value-guided search improves success rates by over 5 percentage points while reducing the average number of MCTS simulations by 5-15 percent compared to baselines that rely only on the VLA prior.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00978v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in structured assembly requires reliable state estimation and adaptive task planning under noisy perception and human interventions. To address these challenges, we introduce a design-grounded human-aware planning framework for human-robot collaborative structured assembly. The framework comprises two coupled modules. Module I, Perception-to-Symbolic State (PSS), employs vision-language models (VLMs) based agents to align RGB-D observations with design specifications and domain knowledge, synthesizing verifiable symbolic assembly states. It outputs validated installed and uninstalled component sets for online state tracking. Module II, Human-Aware Planning and Replanning (HPR), performs task-level multi-robot assignment and updates the plan only when the observed state deviates from the expected execution outcome. It applies a minimal-change replanning rule to selectively revise task assignments and preserve plan stability even under human interventions. We validate the framework on a 27-component timber-frame assembly. The PSS module achieves 97% state synthesis accuracy, and the HPR module maintains feasible task progression across diverse HRC scenarios. Results indicate that integrating VLM-based perception with knowledge-driven planning improves robustness of state estimation and task planning under dynamic conditions.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.00981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established modality for pre-operative planning and is also explored for intra-operative guidance of procedures such as intravascular interventions. Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01067v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper proposes a method for topological mapping and navigation using a monocular camera. Based on AnyLoc, keyframes are converted into descriptors to construct topological relationships, enabling loop detection and map building. Unlike metric maps, topological maps simplify path planning and navigation by representing environments with key nodes instead of precise coordinates. Actions for visual navigation are determined by comparing segmented images with the image associated with target nodes. The system relies solely on a monocular camera, ensuring fast map building and navigation using key nodes. Experiments show effective loop detection and navigation in real and simulation environments without pre-training. Compared to a ResNet-based method, this approach improves success rates by 60.2% on average while reducing time and space costs, offering a lightweight solution for robot and human navigation in various scenarios.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01106v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous object recovery in the hadal zone is challenging due to extreme hydrostatic pressure, limited visibility and currents, and the need for precise manipulation at full ocean depth. Field experimentation in such environments is costly, high-risk, and constrained by limited vehicle availability, making early validation of autonomous behaviors difficult. This paper presents a simulation-based study of a complete autonomous subsea object recovery mission using a Hadal Small Vehicle (HSV) equipped with a three-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and a suction-actuated end effector. The Stonefish simulator is used to model realistic vehicle dynamics, hydrodynamic disturbances, sensing, and interaction with a target object under hadal-like conditions. The control framework combines a world-frame PID controller for vehicle navigation and stabilization with an inverse-kinematics-based manipulator controller augmented by acceleration feed-forward, enabling coordinated vehicle - manipulator operation. In simulation, the HSV autonomously descends from the sea surface to 6,000 m, performs structured seafloor coverage, detects a target object, and executes a suction-based recovery. The results demonstrate that high-fidelity simulation provides an effective and low-risk means of evaluating autonomous deep-sea intervention behaviors prior to field deployment.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01139v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous mapping of unknown environments is a critical challenge, particularly in scenarios where time is limited. Multi-agent systems can enhance efficiency through collaboration, but the scalability of motion-planning algorithms remains a key limitation. Reinforcement learning has been explored as a solution, but existing approaches are constrained by the limited input size required for effective learning, restricting their applicability to discrete environments. This work addresses that limitation by leveraging autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction, compressing high-fidelity occupancy maps into latent state vectors while preserving essential spatial information. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedural generation algorithm based on Perlin noise, designed to generate topologically complex training environments that simulate asteroid fields, caves and forests. These environments are used for training the autoencoder and the navigation algorithm using a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for decentralized coordination. We introduce a weighted consensus mechanism that modulates reliance on shared data via a tuneable trust parameter, ensuring robustness to accumulation of errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system scales effectively with number of agents and generalizes well to unfamiliar, structurally distinct environments and is resilient in communication-constrained settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01144v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Visual challenges in underwater environments significantly hinder the accuracy of vision-based localisation and the high-fidelity dense reconstruction. In this paper, we propose VISO, a robust underwater SLAM system that fuses a stereo camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a 3D sonar to achieve accurate 6-DoF localisation and enable efficient dense 3D reconstruction with high photometric fidelity. We introduce a coarse-to-fine online calibration approach for extrinsic parameters estimation between the 3D sonar and the camera. Additionally, a photometric rendering strategy is proposed for the 3D sonar point cloud to enrich the sonar map with visual information. Extensive experiments in a laboratory tank and an open lake demonstrate that VISO surpasses current state-of-the-art underwater and visual-based SLAM algorithms in terms of localisation robustness and accuracy, while also exhibiting real-time dense 3D reconstruction performance comparable to the offline dense mapping method.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01155v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing methods for multi-agent navigation typically assume fully known environments, offering limited support for partially known scenarios such as warehouses or factory floors. There, agents may need to plan trajectories that balance their own path optimality with their ability to collect and share information about the environment that can help their teammates reach their own goals. To these ends, we propose ORION, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative multi-agent online navigation in partially known environments. Starting from an imperfect prior map, ORION trains agents to make decentralized decisions, coordinate to reach their individual targets, and actively reduce map uncertainty by sharing online observations in a closed perception-action loop. We first design a shared graph encoder that fuses prior map with online perception into a unified representation, providing robust state embeddings under dynamic map discrepancies. At the core of ORION is an option-critic framework that learns to reason about a set of high-level cooperative modes that translate into sequences of low-level actions, allowing agents to switch between individual navigation and team-level exploration adaptively. We further introduce a dual-stage cooperation strategy that enables agents to assist teammates under map uncertainty, thereby reducing the overall makespan. Across extensive maze-like maps and large-scale warehouse environments, our simulation results show that ORION achieves high-quality, real-time decentralized cooperation over varying team sizes, outperforming state-of-the-art classical and learning-based baselines. Finally, we validate ORION on physical robot teams, demonstrating its robustness and practicality for real-world cooperative navigation.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01188v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-modal data fusion in robotic perception systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on handcrafted calibration targets (e.g., checkerboards) or specific, static scene types, limiting their adaptability and deployment in real-world autonomous and robotic applications. This article presents the first self-supervised LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration network that operates in an online fashion and eliminates the need for specific calibration targets. We first identify a significant generalization degradation problem in prior methods, caused by the conventional single-sided data augmentation strategy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel double-sided data augmentation technique that generates multi-perspective camera views using estimated depth maps, thereby enhancing robustness and diversity during training. Built upon this augmentation strategy, we design a dual-path, self-supervised calibration framework that reduces the dependence on high-precision ground truth labels and supports fully adaptive online calibration. Furthermore, to improve cross-modal feature association, we replace the traditional dual-branch feature extraction design with a difference map construction process that explicitly correlates LiDAR and camera features. This not only enhances calibration accuracy but also reduces model complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on five public benchmark datasets, as well as our own recorded dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of generalizability.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01196v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced natural language understanding and human-computer interaction, creating new opportunities in the field of robotics. However, the integration of natural language understanding into robotic control is an important challenge in the rapid development of human-robot interaction and intelligent automation industries. This challenge hinders intuitive human control over complex robotic systems, limiting their educational and practical accessibility. To address this, we present the EduSim-LLM, an educational platform that integrates LLMs with robot simulation and constructs a language-drive control model that translates natural language instructions into executable robot behavior sequences in CoppeliaSim. We design two human-robot interaction models: direct control and autonomous control, conduct systematic simulations based on multiple language models, and evaluate multi-robot collaboration, motion planning, and manipulation capabilities. Experiential results show that LLMs can reliably convert natural language into structured robot actions; after applying prompt-engineering templates instruction-parsing accuracy improves significantly; as task complexity increases, overall accuracy rate exceeds 88.9% in the highest complexity tests.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01282v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Forestry plays a vital role in our society, creating significant ecological, economic, and recreational value. Efficient forest management involves labor-intensive and complex operations. One essential task for maintaining forest health and productivity is selective thinning, which requires skilled operators to remove specific trees to create optimal growing conditions for the remaining ones. In this work, we present a solution based on a small-scale robotic harvester (SAHA) designed for executing this task with supervised autonomy. We build on a 4.5-ton harvester platform and implement key hardware modifications for perception and automatic control. We implement learning- and model-based approaches for precise control of hydraulic actuators, accurate navigation through cluttered environments, robust state estimation, and reliable semantic estimation of terrain traversability. Integrating state-of-the-art techniques in perception, planning, and control, our robotic harvester can autonomously navigate forest environments and reach targeted trees for selective thinning. We present experimental results from extensive field trials over kilometer-long autonomous missions in northern European forests, demonstrating the harvester's ability to operate in real forests. We analyze the performance and provide the lessons learned for advancing robotic forest management.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01438v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: From refrigerators to kitchen drawers, humans interact with articulated objects effortlessly every day while completing household chores. For automating these tasks, service robots must be capable of manipulating arbitrary articulated objects. Recent deep learning methods have been shown to predict valuable priors on the affordance of articulated objects from vision. In contrast, many other works estimate object articulations by observing the articulation motion, but this requires the robot to already be capable of manipulating the object. In this article, we propose a novel approach combining these methods by using a factor graph for online estimation of articulation which fuses learned visual priors and proprioceptive sensing during interaction into an analytical model of articulation based on Screw Theory. With our method, a robotic system makes an initial prediction of articulation from vision before touching the object, and then quickly updates the estimate from kinematic and force sensing during manipulation. We evaluate our method extensively in both simulations and real-world robotic manipulation experiments. We demonstrate several closed-loop estimation and manipulation experiments in which the robot was capable of opening previously unseen drawers. In real hardware experiments, the robot achieved a 75% success rate for autonomous opening of unknown articulated objects.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01561v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurate localization for quadrupedal robots operating in narrow tunnel-like environments. Due to the long and homogeneous characteristics of such scenarios, LiDAR measurements often provide weak geometric constraints, making traditional sensor fusion methods susceptible to accumulated motion estimation errors. To address these challenges, we propose AIMS, an adaptive LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry fusion method for robust quadrupedal robot localization in degenerate environments. The proposed method is formulated within an error-state Kalman filtering framework, where LiDAR and leg odometry measurements are integrated with IMU-based state prediction, and measurement noise covariance matrices are adaptively adjusted based on online degeneracy-aware reliability assessment. Experimental results obtained in narrow corridor environments demonstrate that the proposed method improves localization accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01618v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation is increasingly important for real-world deployment, requiring spatial disambiguation in complex layouts and temporal resilience under dynamic interaction. However, existing end-to-end and hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies often rely on text-only cues while keeping plan intent latent, which undermines referential grounding in cluttered or underspecified scenes, impedes effective task decomposition of long-horizon goals with close-loop interaction, and limits causal explanation by obscuring the rationale behind action choices. To address these issues, we first introduce Visual Sketch, an implausible visual intermediate that renders points, boxes, arrows, and typed relations in the robot's current views to externalize spatial intent, connect language to scene geometry. Building on Visual Sketch, we present Action-Sketcher, a VLA framework that operates in a cyclic See-Think-Sketch-Act workflow coordinated by adaptive token-gated strategy for reasoning triggers, sketch revision, and action issuance, thereby supporting reactive corrections and human interaction while preserving real-time action prediction. To enable scalable training and evaluation, we curate diverse corpus with interleaved images, text, Visual Sketch supervision, and action sequences, and train Action-Sketcher with a multi-stage curriculum recipe that combines interleaved sequence alignment for modality unification, language-to-sketch consistency for precise linguistic grounding, and imitation learning augmented with sketch-to-action reinforcement for robustness. Extensive experiments on cluttered scenes and multi-object tasks, in simulation and on real-world tasks, show improved long-horizon success, stronger robustness to dynamic scene changes, and enhanced interpretability via editable sketches and step-wise plans.

The method extracts structured motion trajectories of both hands and objects from raw video data. These trajectories serve as motion priors for a novel reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline that learns to refine them through contact-rich interactions, thereby eliminating the need to learn from scratch. To address the challenge of learning long-horizon manipulation skills, we introduce: (1) Temporal-segment based RL to enforce temporal alignment of the current state with demonstrations; (2) Success-Gated Reset strategy to balance the refinement of readily acquired skills and the exploration of subsequent task stages; and (3) Event-Driven Reward curriculum with adaptive thresholding to guide the RL learning of high-precision manipulation. The novel video processing and RL framework successfully achieved long-horizon synchronous and asynchronous bimanual assembly tasks, offering a scalable approach for direct skill acquisition from human videos.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01675v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Knowledge of the 6D pose of an object can benefit in-hand object manipulation. In-hand 6D object pose estimation is challenging because of heavy occlusion produced by the robot's grippers, which can have an adverse effect on methods that rely on vision data only. Many robots are equipped with tactile sensors at their fingertips that could be used to complement vision data. In this paper, we present a method that uses both tactile and vision data to estimate the pose of an object grasped in a robot's hand. To address challenges like lack of standard representation for tactile data and sensor fusion, we propose the use of point clouds to represent object surfaces in contact with the tactile sensor and present a network architecture based on pixel-wise dense fusion. We also extend NVIDIA's Deep Learning Dataset Synthesizer to produce synthetic photo-realistic vision data and corresponding tactile point clouds. Results suggest that using tactile data in addition to vision data improves the 6D pose estimate, and our network generalizes successfully from synthetic training to real physical robots.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses the topic of robustness under sensing noise, ambiguous instructions, and human-robot interaction. We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible "explicit world model" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.

This research focuses on enhancing MRI's role in medical imaging, especially in its application to guide intravascular interventions using robot-assisted devices. A newly developed computational system is introduced, designed for seamless integration with the MRI scanner, including a computational unit and user interface. This system processes MR images to delineate the vascular network, establishing virtual paths and boundaries within vessels to prevent procedural damage. Key findings reveal the system's capability to create tailored magnetic field gradient patterns for device control, considering the vessel's geometry and safety norms, and adapting to different blood flow characteristics for finer navigation. Additionally, the system's modeling aspect assesses the safety and feasibility of navigating pre-set vascular paths. Conclusively, this system, based on the Qt framework and C/C++, with specialized software modules, represents a major step forward in merging imaging technology with robotic aid, significantly enhancing precision and safety in intravascular procedures.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01762v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has rapidly progressed, enabling joint perception and planning in complex environments. In the planning stage, state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end autonomous driving models decouple planning into parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions. While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information. To address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision. Evaluated on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, our method sets a new SOTA, achieving a driving score of 89.07 and a success rate of 73.18%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01822v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has garnered significant attention. Existing methods either ingeniously match geometric priors or utilize sparse semantics to reduce FLoc uncertainty. However, they still suffer from ambiguous FLoc caused by repetitive structures within minimalist floorplans. Moreover, expensive but limited semantic annotations restrict their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DisCo-FLoc, which utilizes dual-level visual-geometric Contrasts to Disambiguate depth-aware visual Floc, without requiring additional semantic labels. Our solution begins with a ray regression predictor tailored for ray-casting-based FLoc, predicting a series of FLoc candidates using depth estimation expertise. In addition, a novel contrastive learning method with position-level and orientation-level constraints is proposed to strictly match depth-aware visual features with the corresponding geometric structures in the floorplan. Such matches can effectively eliminate FLoc ambiguity and select the optimal imaging pose from FLoc candidates. Exhaustive comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic-based method, achieving significant improvements in both robustness and accuracy.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Autonomous language-guided navigation in large-scale outdoor environments remains a key challenge in mobile robotics, due to difficulties in semantic reasoning, dynamic conditions, and long-term stability. We propose CausalNav, the first scene graph-based semantic navigation framework tailored for dynamic outdoor environments. We construct a multi-level semantic scene graph using LLMs, referred to as the Embodied Graph, that hierarchically integrates coarse-grained map data with fine-grained object entities. The constructed graph serves as a retrievable knowledge base for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling semantic navigation and long-range planning under open-vocabulary queries. By fusing real-time perception with offline map data, the Embodied Graph supports robust navigation across varying spatial granularities in dynamic outdoor environments. Dynamic objects are explicitly handled in both the scene graph construction and hierarchical planning modules. The Embodied Graph is continuously updated within a temporal window to reflect environmental changes and support real-time semantic navigation. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate superior robustness and efficiency.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01946v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We report a mixed-methods field experiment of a conversational service robot deployed under everyday staffing discretion in a live bedding store. Over 12 days we alternated three conditions--Baseline (no robot), Robot-only, and Robot+Fixture--and video-annotated the service funnel from passersby to purchase. An explanatory sequential design then used six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret the quantitative patterns.   Quantitatively, the robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with the fixture), yet clerk-led downstream steps per stopper--clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, and purchase--decreased. Interviews explained this divergence: clerks avoided interrupting ongoing robot-customer talk, struggled with ambiguous timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that often satisfied curiosity at the doorway. The fixture amplified visibility but also anchored encounters at the threshold, creating a well-defined micro-space where needs could ``close'' without moving inside.   We synthesize these strands into an integrative account from the initial show of interest on the part of a customer to their entering the store and derive actionable guidance. The results advance the understanding of interactions between customers, staff members, and the robot and offer practical recommendations for deploying service robots in high-touch retail.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01948v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diffusion policies (DP) have recently shown great promise for generating actions in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches often rely on global instructions to produce short-term control signals, which can result in misalignment in action generation. We conjecture that the primitive skills, referred to as fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations, such as ``move up'' and ``open the gripper'', provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning. To bridge this gap, we propose SDP, a skill-conditioned DP that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. SDP abstracts eight reusable primitive skills across tasks and employs a vision-language model to extract discrete representations from visual observations and language instructions. Based on them, a lightweight router network is designed to assign a desired primitive skill for each state, which helps construct a single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions. By decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of primitive skills and selecting a single-skill policy, SDP ensures skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate that SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods, providing a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01969v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Designing policies that are both efficient and acceptable for conversational service robots in open and diverse environments is non-trivial. Unlike fixed, hand-tuned parameters, online learning can adapt to non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we study how to adapt a social robot's speech policy in the wild. During a 12-day in-situ deployment with over 1,400 public encounters, we cast online policy optimization as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling to select among six actions defined by speech rate (slow/normal/fast) and verbosity (concise/detailed). We compare three complementary binary rewards--Ru (user rating), Rc (conversation closure), and Rt (>=2 turns)--and show that each induces distinct arm distributions and interaction behaviors. We complement the online results with offline evaluations that analyze contextual factors (e.g., crowd level, group size) using video-annotated data. Taken together, we distill ready-to-use design lessons for deploying online optimization of speech policies in real public HRI settings.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.01971v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Koopman operator theory has emerged as a leading data-driven approach that relies on a judicious choice of observable functions to realize global linear representations of nonlinear systems in the lifted observable space. However, real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain an accurate and unbiased approximation of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator generated from noisy datasets is typically corrupted by noise-induced bias that severely degrades prediction and downstream tracking performance. In order to address this drawback, this paper proposes a novel autoencoder-based neural architecture to jointly learn the appropriate lifting functions and the reduced-bias Koopman operator from noisy data. The architecture initially learns the Koopman basis functions that are consistent for both the forward and backward temporal dynamics of the system. Subsequently, by utilizing the learned forward and backward temporal dynamics, the Koopman operator is synthesized with a reduced bias making the method more robust to noise compared to existing techniques. Theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate significant bias reduction in the presence of training noise. Dynamics prediction and tracking control simulations are conducted for multiple serial manipulator arms, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, to demonstrate its robustness under various noise levels. Experimental studies with the Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator arm are further used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting.

Collecting data in the physical world poses prohibitive costs and scalability challenges, and prevailing simulation benchmarks frequently suffer from fragmentation, narrow scope, or insufficient fidelity to enable effective sim-to-real transfer. To address these challenges, we introduce Genie Sim 3.0, a unified simulation platform for robotic manipulation. We present Genie Sim Generator, a large language model (LLM)-powered tool that constructs high-fidelity scenes from natural language instructions. Its principal strength resides in rapid and multi-dimensional generalization, facilitating the synthesis of diverse environments to support scalable data collection and robust policy evaluation. We introduce the first benchmark that pioneers the application of LLM for automated evaluation. It leverages LLM to mass-generate evaluation scenarios and employs Vision-Language Model (VLM) to establish an automated assessment pipeline. We also release an open-source dataset comprising more than 10,000 hours of synthetic data across over 200 tasks. Through systematic experimentation, we validate the robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability of our open-source dataset, demonstrating that synthetic data can server as an effective substitute for real-world data under controlled conditions for scalable policy training.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02085v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.

We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02184v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate altitude estimation and reliable floor recognition are critical for mobile robot localization and navigation within complex multi-storey environments. In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost vertical estimation framework leveraging differential barometric sensing integrated within a fully ROS-compliant software package. Our system simultaneously publishes real-time altitude data from both a stationary base station and a mobile sensor, enabling precise and drift-free vertical localization. Empirical evaluations conducted in challenging scenarios -- such as fully enclosed stairwells and elevators, demonstrate that our proposed barometric pipeline achieves sub-meter vertical accuracy (RMSE: 0.29 m) and perfect (100%) floor-level identification. In contrast, our results confirm that standalone height estimates, obtained solely from visual- or LiDAR-based SLAM odometry, are insufficient for reliable vertical localization. The proposed ROS-compatible barometric module thus provides a practical and cost-effective solution for robust vertical awareness in real-world robotic deployments. The implementation of our method is released as open source at https://github.com/witsir/differential-barometric.

- **摘要**: arXiv:2601.02295v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current work on robot failure detection and correction typically operate in a post hoc manner, analyzing errors and applying corrections only after failures occur. This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.
